ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND  Lewis Carroll  THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 3.0     
  CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole  Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversations?'  So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. 
There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. 
In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again. 
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well. 
Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. 
'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely true.)  Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! 'I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) '--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)  Presently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) '--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'  Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!' (Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'Do bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over. 
Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof. 
There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again. 
Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!  Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible. 
There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters. 
It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and see whether it's marked "poison" or not'; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later. 
However, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off. 
  *    *    *    *    *    *    *      *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *  
  'What a curious feeling!' said Alice; 'I must be shutting up like a telescope.'  And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; 'for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, 'in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing. 
After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. 
'Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself, rather sharply; 'I advise you to leave off this minute!' She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. 'But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, 'to pretend to be two people! Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!'  Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words 'EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants. 'Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, 'and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!'  She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, 'Which way? Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way. 
So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake. 
  *    *    *    *    *    *    *      *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *     
  CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears  'Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); 'now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). 'Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure _I_ shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be kind to them,' thought Alice, 'or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'  And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. 'They must go by the carrier,' she thought; 'and how funny it'll seem, sending presents to one's own feet! And how odd the directions will look!       
  ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.       HEARTHRUG,          NEAR THE FENDER,            (WITH ALICE'S LOVE). 
Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'  Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door. 
Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again. 
'You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, 'a great girl like you,' (she might well say this), 'to go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!' But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall. 
After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, 'Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!' Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, 'If you please, sir--' The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go. 
Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: 'Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!' And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them. 
'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I, and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little--"' and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--       'How doth the little crocodile       Improve his shining tail,      And pour the waters of the Nile       On every golden scale!       'How cheerfully he seems to grin,       How neatly spread his claws,      And welcome little fishes in       With gently smiling jaws!'  'I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, 'I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!" I shall only look up and say "Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, 'I do wish they WOULD put their heads down! I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'  As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while she was talking. 'How CAN I have done that?' she thought. 'I must be growing small again.' She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether. 
'That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; 'and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, 'and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child, 'for I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare it's too bad, that it is!'  As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, 'and in that case I can go back by railway,' she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high. 
'I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out. 'I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.'  Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself. 
'Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, 'to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.' So she began: 'O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!' (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, 'A mouse--of a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!') The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing. 
'Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; 'I daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.' (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: 'Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. 'Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feelings. 'I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'  'Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. 'Would YOU like cats if you were me?'  'Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: 'don't be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, 'and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. 'We won't talk about her any more if you'd rather not.'  'We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail. 'As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!'  'I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. 'Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?' The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: 'There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, 'I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went. 
So she called softly after it, 'Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!' When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, 'Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'  It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore. 
   CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale  They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable. 
The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, 'I am older than you, and must know better'; and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said. 
At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, 'Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL soon make you dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon. 
'Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, 'are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! "William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--"'  'Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver. 
'I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: 'Did you speak?'  'Not I!' said the Lory hastily. 
'I thought you did,' said the Mouse. '--I proceed. "Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable--"'  'Found WHAT?' said the Duck. 
'Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: 'of course you know what "it" means.'  'I know what "it" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said the Duck: 'it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop find?'  The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, '"--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. William's conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his Normans--" How are you getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke. 
'As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone: 'it doesn't seem to dry me at all.'  'In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, 'I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies--'  'Speak English!' said the Eaglet. 'I don't know the meaning of half those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!' And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly. 
'What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone, 'was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'  'What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything. 
'Why,' said the Dodo, 'the best way to explain it is to do it.' (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)  First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ('the exact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was no 'One, two, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out 'The race is over!' and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, 'But who has won?'  This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said, 'EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.'  'But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices asked. 
'Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, 'Prizes! Prizes!'  Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece all round. 
'But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse. 
'Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. 'What else have you got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice. 
'Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly. 
'Hand it over here,' said the Dodo. 
Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying 'We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble'; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered. 
Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could. 
The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more. 
'You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice, 'and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again. 
'Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing. 
'It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse's tail; 'but why do you call it sad?' And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:--           'Fury said to a          mouse, That he         met in the        house,      "Let us       both go to        law: I will         prosecute          YOU.--Come,            I'll take no            denial; We           must have a         trial: For       really this      morning I've     nothing     to do."      Said the       mouse to the        cur, "Such         a trial,          dear Sir,             With           no jury         or judge,        would be       wasting       our       breath."        "I'll be         judge, I'll          be jury,"             Said          cunning           old Fury:           "I'll           try the             whole             cause,               and            condemn            you           to            death."'   'You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely. 'What are you thinking of?'  'I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly: 'you had got to the fifth bend, I think?'  'I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily. 
'A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her. 'Oh, do let me help to undo it!'  'I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. 'You insult me by talking such nonsense!'  'I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice. 'But you're so easily offended, you know!'  The Mouse only growled in reply. 
'Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, 'Yes, please do!' but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker. 
'What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter 'Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose YOUR temper!' 'Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the young Crab, a little snappishly. 'You're enough to try the patience of an oyster!'  'I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular. 'She'd soon fetch it back!'  'And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?' said the Lory. 
Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: 'Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for catching mice you can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!'  This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, 'I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, 'Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!' On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone. 
'I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a melancholy tone. 'Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!' And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story. 
   CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill  It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself 'The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely. 
Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, 'Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made. 
'He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran. 'How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.' As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name 'W. RABBIT' engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves. 
'How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, 'to be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next!' And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: '"Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!" "Coming in a minute, nurse! But I've got to see that the mouse doesn't get out." Only I don't think,' Alice went on, 'that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!'  By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time with the words 'DRINK ME,' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. 'I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself, 'whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'  It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself 'That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so much!'  Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself 'Now I can do no more, whatever happens. What WILL become of me?'  Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy. 
'It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, 'when one wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what CAN have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a sorrowful tone; 'at least there's no room to grow up any more HERE.'  'But then,' thought Alice, 'shall I NEVER get any older than I am now? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!'  'Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. 'How can you learn lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no room at all for any lesson-books!'  And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen. 
'Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. 'Fetch me my gloves this moment!' Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it. 
Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself 'Then I'll go round and get in at the window.'  'THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort. 
Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--'Pat! Pat! Where are you?' And then a voice she had never heard before, 'Sure then I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honour!'  'Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. 'Here! Come and help me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.)  'Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'  'Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it 'arrum.')  'An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole window!'  'Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'  'Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!'  There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, 'Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at all!' 'Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. 'What a number of cucumber-frames there must be!' thought Alice. 'I wonder what they'll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm sure I don't want to stay in here any longer!'  She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: 'Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up at this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half high enough yet--Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down! Heads below!' (a loud crash)--'Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--Who's to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I won't, then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to go down the chimney!'  'Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said Alice to herself. 'Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!'  She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself 'This is Bill,' she gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next. 
The first thing she heard was a general chorus of 'There goes Bill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--'Catch him, you by the hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--'Hold up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell us all about it!'  Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, ('That's Bill,' thought Alice,) 'Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm better now--but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!'  'So you did, old fellow!' said the others. 
'We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and Alice called out as loud as she could, 'If you do. I'll set Dinah at you!'  There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, 'I wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any sense, they'd take the roof off.' After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, 'A barrowful will do, to begin with.'  'A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face. 'I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out, 'You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead silence. 
Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head. 'If I eat one of these cakes,' she thought, 'it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.'  So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood. 
'The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, 'is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.'  It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry. 
An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. 'Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing. 
Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut. 
This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance. 
'And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: 'I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again! Let me see--how IS it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?'  The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it. 
She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else. 
   CHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar  The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice. 
'Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar. 
This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, 'I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.'  'What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly. 'Explain yourself!'  'I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, 'because I'm not myself, you see.'  'I don't see,' said the Caterpillar. 
'I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very politely, 'for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.'  'It isn't,' said the Caterpillar. 
'Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; 'but when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little queer, won't you?'  'Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar. 
'Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice; 'all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.'  'You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. 'Who are YOU?'  Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, 'I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'  'Why?' said the Caterpillar. 
Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away. 
'Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her. 'I've something important to say!'  This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again. 
'Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar. 
'Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could. 
'No,' said the Caterpillar. 
Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, 'So you think you're changed, do you?'  'I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; 'I can't remember things as I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'  'Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar. 
'Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it all came different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice. 
'Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar. 
Alice folded her hands, and began:--     'You are old, Father William,' the young man said,     'And your hair has become very white;    And yet you incessantly stand on your head--     Do you think, at your age, it is right?'     'In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,     'I feared it might injure the brain;    But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,     Why, I do it again and again.'     'You are old,' said the youth, 'as I mentioned before,     And have grown most uncommonly fat;    Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--     Pray, what is the reason of that?'     'In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,     'I kept all my limbs very supple    By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--     Allow me to sell you a couple?'     'You are old,' said the youth, 'and your jaws are too weak     For anything tougher than suet;    Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--     Pray how did you manage to do it?'     'In my youth,' said his father, 'I took to the law,     And argued each case with my wife;    And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,     Has lasted the rest of my life.'     'You are old,' said the youth, 'one would hardly suppose     That your eye was as steady as ever;    Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--     What made you so awfully clever?'     'I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'     Said his father; 'don't give yourself airs!    Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?     Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'   'That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar. 
'Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; 'some of the words have got altered.'  'It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes. 
The Caterpillar was the first to speak. 
'What size do you want to be?' it asked. 
'Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied; 'only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.'  'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar. 
Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper. 
'Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar. 
'Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,' said Alice: 'three inches is such a wretched height to be.'  'It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high). 
'But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she thought of herself, 'I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily offended!'  'You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again. 
This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, 'One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.'  'One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to herself. 
'Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight. 
Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand. 
'And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!  She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit. 
   *    *    *    *    *    *    *      *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *  
   'Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her. 
'What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice. 'And where HAVE my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?' She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves. 
As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings. 
'Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon. 
'I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly. 'Let me alone!'  'Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, 'I've tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!'  'I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said Alice. 
'I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; 'but those serpents! There's no pleasing them!'  Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished. 
'As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the Pigeon; 'but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'  'I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning. 
'And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, 'and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!'  'But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice. 'I'm a--I'm a--'  'Well! WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon. 'I can see you're trying to invent something!'  'I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day. 
'A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt. 'I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never ONE with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a serpent; and there's no use denying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!'  'I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very truthful child; 'but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.'  'I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; 'but if they do, why then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'  This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, 'You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a serpent?'  'It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; 'but I'm not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want YOURS: I don't like them raw.'  'Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height. 
It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. 'Come, there's half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to another! However, I've got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. 'Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, 'it'll never do to come upon them THIS size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!' So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high. 
   CHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper  For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen. 
The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, 'For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.' The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, 'From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.'  Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together. 
Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky. 
Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked. 
'There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, 'and that for two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.' And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces. 
'Please, then,' said Alice, 'how am I to get in?'  'There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went on without attending to her, 'if we had the door between us. For instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.' He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. 'But perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; 'his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he might answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud. 
'I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, 'till tomorrow--'  At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him. 
'--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened. 
'How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone. 
'ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman. 'That's the first question, you know.'  It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. 'It's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, 'the way all the creatures argue. It's enough to drive one crazy!'  The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations. 'I shall sit here,' he said, 'on and off, for days and days.'  'But what am I to do?' said Alice. 
'Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling. 
'Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately: 'he's perfectly idiotic!' And she opened the door and went in. 
The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup. 
'There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing. 
There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause. The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear. 
'Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, 'why your cat grins like that?'  'It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, 'and that's why. Pig!'  She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:--  'I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know that cats COULD grin.'  'They all can,' said the Duchess; 'and most of 'em do.'  'I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation. 
'You don't know much,' said the Duchess; 'and that's a fact.'  Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not. 
'Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of terror. 'Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off. 
'If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, 'the world would go round a deal faster than it does.'  'Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. 'Just think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis--'  'Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, 'chop off her head!'  Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: 'Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is it twelve? I--'  'Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; 'I never could abide figures!' And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line:     'Speak roughly to your little boy,     And beat him when he sneezes:    He only does it to annoy,     Because he knows it teases.'           CHORUS. 
 (In which the cook and the baby joined):--         'Wow! wow! wow!'  While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:--     'I speak severely to my boy,     I beat him when he sneezes;    For he can thoroughly enjoy     The pepper when he pleases!'           CHORUS. 
       'Wow! wow! wow!'  'Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. 'I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her. 
Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, 'just like a star-fish,' thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it. 
As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air. 'IF I don't take this child away with me,' thought Alice, 'they're sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be murder to leave it behind?' She said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). 'Don't grunt,' said Alice; 'that's not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.'  The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all. 'But perhaps it was only sobbing,' she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears. 
No, there were no tears. 'If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,' said Alice, seriously, 'I'll have nothing more to do with you. Mind now!' The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for some while in silence. 
Alice was just beginning to think to herself, 'Now, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could be NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further. 
So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood. 'If it had grown up,' she said to herself, 'it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.' And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, 'if one only knew the right way to change them--' when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off. 
The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect. 
'Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider. 'Come, it's pleased so far,' thought Alice, and she went on. 'Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?'  'That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said the Cat. 
'I don't much care where--' said Alice. 
'Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat. 
'--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation. 
'Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, 'if you only walk long enough.'  Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. 'What sort of people live about here?'  'In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round, 'lives a Hatter: and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw, 'lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.'  'But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked. 
'Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: 'we're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad.'  'How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice. 
'You must be,' said the Cat, 'or you wouldn't have come here.'  Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on 'And how do you know that you're mad?'  'To begin with,' said the Cat, 'a dog's not mad. You grant that?'  'I suppose so,' said Alice. 
'Well, then,' the Cat went on, 'you see, a dog growls when it's angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'  'I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice. 
'Call it what you like,' said the Cat. 'Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?'  'I should like it very much,' said Alice, 'but I haven't been invited yet.'  'You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished. 
Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again. 
'By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat. 'I'd nearly forgotten to ask.'  'It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way. 
'I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again. 
Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live. 'I've seen hatters before,' she said to herself; 'the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.' As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree. 
'Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat. 
'I said pig,' replied Alice; 'and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.'  'All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone. 
'Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice; 'but a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!'  She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself 'Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I'd gone to see the Hatter instead!'     CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party  There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. 'Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice; 'only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.'  The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: 'No room! No room!' they cried out when they saw Alice coming. 'There's PLENTY of room!' said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table. 
'Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone. 
Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. 'I don't see any wine,' she remarked. 
'There isn't any,' said the March Hare. 
'Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice angrily. 
'It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,' said the March Hare. 
'I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; 'it's laid for a great many more than three.'  'Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech. 
'You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said with some severity; 'it's very rude.'  The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he SAID was, 'Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'  'Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they've begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she added aloud. 
'Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?' said the March Hare. 
'Exactly so,' said Alice. 
'Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on. 
'I do,' Alice hastily replied; 'at least--at least I mean what I say--that's the same thing, you know.'  'Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter. 'You might just as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat what I see"!'  'You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, 'that "I like what I get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!'  'You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his sleep, 'that "I breathe when I sleep" is the same thing as "I sleep when I breathe"!'  'It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn't much. 
The Hatter was the first to break the silence. 'What day of the month is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to his ear. 
Alice considered a little, and then said 'The fourth.'  'Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. 'I told you butter wouldn't suit the works!' he added looking angrily at the March Hare. 
'It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied. 
'Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter grumbled: 'you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'  The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, 'It was the BEST butter, you know.'  Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. 'What a funny watch!' she remarked. 'It tells the day of the month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!'  'Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. 'Does YOUR watch tell you what year it is?'  'Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: 'but that's because it stays the same year for such a long time together.'  'Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter. 
Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. 'I don't quite understand you,' she said, as politely as she could. 
'The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose. 
The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, 'Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.'  'Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to Alice again. 
'No, I give it up,' Alice replied: 'what's the answer?'  'I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter. 
'Nor I,' said the March Hare. 
Alice sighed wearily. 'I think you might do something better with the time,' she said, 'than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.'  'If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, 'you wouldn't talk about wasting IT. It's HIM.'  'I don't know what you mean,' said Alice. 
'Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously. 'I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'  'Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: 'but I know I have to beat time when I learn music.'  'Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter. 'He won't stand beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!'  ('I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)  'That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully: 'but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'  'Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter: 'but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked.'  'Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked. 
The Hatter shook his head mournfully. 'Not I!' he replied. 'We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--' (pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) '--it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing       "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!      How I wonder what you're at!"  You know the song, perhaps?'  'I've heard something like it,' said Alice. 
'It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, 'in this way:--       "Up above the world you fly,      Like a tea-tray in the sky. 
        Twinkle, twinkle--"'  Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep 'Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop. 
'Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter, 'when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the time! Off with his head!"'  'How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice. 
'And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, 'he won't do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.'  A bright idea came into Alice's head. 'Is that the reason so many tea-things are put out here?' she asked. 
'Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: 'it's always tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'  'Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice. 
'Exactly so,' said the Hatter: 'as the things get used up.'  'But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice ventured to ask. 
'Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted, yawning. 'I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.'  'I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at the proposal. 
'Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried. 'Wake up, Dormouse!' And they pinched it on both sides at once. 
The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. 'I wasn't asleep,' he said in a hoarse, feeble voice: 'I heard every word you fellows were saying.'  'Tell us a story!' said the March Hare. 
'Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice. 
'And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, 'or you'll be asleep again before it's done.'  'Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the Dormouse began in a great hurry; 'and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--'  'What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking. 
'They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two. 
'They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently remarked; 'they'd have been ill.'  'So they were,' said the Dormouse; 'VERY ill.'  Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: 'But why did they live at the bottom of a well?'  'Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly. 
'I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, 'so I can't take more.'  'You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: 'it's very easy to take MORE than nothing.'  'Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice. 
'Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked triumphantly. 
Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her question. 'Why did they live at the bottom of a well?'  The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, 'It was a treacle-well.'  'There's no such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but the Hatter and the March Hare went 'Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse sulkily remarked, 'If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for yourself.'  'No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; 'I won't interrupt again. I dare say there may be ONE.'  'One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to go on. 'And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw, you know--'  'What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise. 
'Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time. 
'I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter: 'let's all move one place on.'  He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate. 
Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very cautiously: 'But I don't understand. Where did they draw the treacle from?'  'You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; 'so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?'  'But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to notice this last remark. 
'Of course they were', said the Dormouse; '--well in.'  This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it. 
'They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; 'and they drew all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'  'Why with an M?' said Alice. 
'Why not?' said the March Hare. 
Alice was silent. 
The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little shriek, and went on: '--that begins with an M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'  'Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, 'I don't think--'  'Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter. 
This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot. 
'At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she picked her way through the wood. 'It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life!'  Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it. 'That's very curious!' she thought. 'But everything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.' And in she went. 
Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table. 'Now, I'll manage better this time,' she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains. 
   CHAPTER VIII. The Queen's Croquet-Ground  A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, 'Look out now, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me like that!'  'I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; 'Seven jogged my elbow.'  On which Seven looked up and said, 'That's right, Five! Always lay the blame on others!'  'YOU'D better not talk!' said Five. 'I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'  'What for?' said the one who had spoken first. 
'That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven. 
'Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, 'and I'll tell him--it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'  Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun 'Well, of all the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low. 
'Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, 'why you are painting those roses?'  Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low voice, 'Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to--' At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out 'The Queen! The Queen!' and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen. 
First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS. 
Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; 'and besides, what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, 'if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see it?' So she stood still where she was, and waited. 
When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely 'Who is this?' She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply. 
'Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to Alice, she went on, 'What's your name, child?'  'My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very politely; but she added, to herself, 'Why, they're only a pack of cards, after all. I needn't be afraid of them!'  'And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children. 
'How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage. 'It's no business of MINE.'  The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed 'Off with her head! Off--'  'Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent. 
The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said 'Consider, my dear: she is only a child!'  The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave 'Turn them over!'  The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot. 
'Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else. 
'Leave off that!' screamed the Queen. 'You make me giddy.' And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, 'What HAVE you been doing here?'  'May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, 'we were trying--'  'I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses. 'Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection. 
'You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others. 
'Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen. 
'Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers shouted in reply. 
'That's right!' shouted the Queen. 'Can you play croquet?'  The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidently meant for her. 
'Yes!' shouted Alice. 
'Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession, wondering very much what would happen next. 
'It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side. She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face. 
'Very,' said Alice: '--where's the Duchess?'  'Hush! Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered 'She's under sentence of execution.'  'What for?' said Alice. 
'Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked. 
'No, I didn't,' said Alice: 'I don't think it's at all a pity. I said "What for?"'  'She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little scream of laughter. 'Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone. 'The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the Queen said--'  'Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches. 
The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed. 
The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her head!' about once in a minute. 
Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, 'and then,' thought she, 'what would become of me? They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any one left alive!'  She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself 'It's the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.'  'How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with. 
Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. 'It's no use speaking to it,' she thought, 'till its ears have come, or at least one of them.' In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared. 
'I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather a complaining tone, 'and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming!'  'How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice. 
'Not at all,' said Alice: 'she's so extremely--' Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on, '--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game.'  The Queen smiled and passed on. 
'Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity. 
'It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice: 'allow me to introduce it.'  'I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King: 'however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.'  'I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked. 
'Don't be impertinent,' said the King, 'and don't look at me like that!' He got behind Alice as he spoke. 
'A cat may look at a king,' said Alice. 'I've read that in some book, but I don't remember where.'  'Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, 'My dear! I wish you would have this cat removed!'  The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. 'Off with his head!' she said, without even looking round. 
'I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and he hurried off. 
Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog. 
The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree. 
By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: 'but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, 'as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.' So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend. 
When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable. 
The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said. 
The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin at HIS time of life. 
The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense. 
The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)  Alice could think of nothing else to say but 'It belongs to the Duchess: you'd better ask HER about it.'  'She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner: 'fetch her here.' And the executioner went off like an arrow. 
 The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game. 
   CHAPTER IX. The Mock Turtle's Story  'You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!' said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's, and they walked off together. 
Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen. 
'When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone though), 'I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL. Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, 'and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you know--'  She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. 'You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can't tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.'  'Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark. 
'Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess. 'Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it.' And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as she spoke. 
Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could. 
'The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little. 
''Tis so,' said the Duchess: 'and the moral of that is--"Oh, 'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!"'  'Somebody said,' Alice whispered, 'that it's done by everybody minding their own business!'  'Ah, well! It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess, digging her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added, 'and the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves."'  'How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to herself. 
'I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist,' the Duchess said after a pause: 'the reason is, that I'm doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?'  'HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried. 
'Very true,' said the Duchess: 'flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock together."'  'Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked. 
'Right, as usual,' said the Duchess: 'what a clear way you have of putting things!'  'It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice. 
'Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said; 'there's a large mustard-mine near here. And the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours."'  'Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark, 'it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it is.'  'I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; 'and the moral of that is--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put more simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise."'  'I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very politely, 'if I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it as you say it.'  'That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess replied, in a pleased tone. 
'Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,' said Alice. 
'Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess. 'I make you a present of everything I've said as yet.'  'A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they don't give birthday presents like that!' But she did not venture to say it out loud. 
'Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin. 
'I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to feel a little worried. 
'Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, 'as pigs have to fly; and the m--'  But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away, even in the middle of her favourite word 'moral,' and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm. 
'A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak voice. 
'Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke; 'either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time! Take your choice!'  The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment. 
'Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground. 
The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence, and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay would cost them their lives. 
All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players, and shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her head!' Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of execution. 
Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, 'Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'  'No,' said Alice. 'I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'  'It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen. 
'I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice. 
'Come on, then,' said the Queen, 'and he shall tell you his history,'  As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company generally, 'You are all pardoned.' 'Come, THAT'S a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered. 
They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) 'Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, 'and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited. 
The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. 'What fun!' said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice. 
'What IS the fun?' said Alice. 
'Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon. 'It's all her fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know. Come on!'  'Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, as she went slowly after it: 'I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!'  They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She pitied him deeply. 'What is his sorrow?' she asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, 'It's all his fancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know. Come on!'  So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing. 
'This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, 'she wants for to know your history, she do.'  'I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: 'sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.'  So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to herself, 'I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he doesn't begin.' But she waited patiently. 
'Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, 'I was a real Turtle.'  These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of 'Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, 'Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing. 
'When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, 'we went to school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him Tortoise--'  'Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked. 
'We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock Turtle angrily: 'really you are very dull!'  'You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, 'Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words:  'Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it--'  'I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice. 
'You did,' said the Mock Turtle. 
'Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again. The Mock Turtle went on. 
'We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day--'  'I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; 'you needn't be so proud as all that.'  'With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously. 
'Yes,' said Alice, 'we learned French and music.'  'And washing?' said the Mock Turtle. 
'Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly. 
'Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief. 'Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill, "French, music, AND WASHING--extra."'  'You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; 'living at the bottom of the sea.'  'I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. 'I only took the regular course.'  'What was that?' inquired Alice. 
'Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock Turtle replied; 'and then the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.'  'I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say. 'What is it?'  The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. 'What! Never heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed. 'You know what to beautify is, I suppose?'  'Yes,' said Alice doubtfully: 'it means--to--make--anything--prettier.'  'Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, 'if you don't know what to uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.'  Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said 'What else had you to learn?'  'Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects on his flappers, '--Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, that used to come once a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.'  'What was THAT like?' said Alice. 
'Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said: 'I'm too stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.'  'Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: 'I went to the Classics master, though. He was an old crab, HE was.'  'I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: 'he taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'  'So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both creatures hid their faces in their paws. 
'And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a hurry to change the subject. 
'Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: 'nine the next, and so on.'  'What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice. 
'That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon remarked: 'because they lessen from day to day.'  This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark. 'Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?'  'Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle. 
'And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly. 
'That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone: 'tell her something about the games now.'     CHAPTER X. The Lobster Quadrille  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice. 'Same as if he had a bone in his throat,' said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on again:--  'You may not have lived much under the sea--' ('I haven't,' said Alice)--'and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--' (Alice began to say 'I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily, and said 'No, never') '--so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!'  'No, indeed,' said Alice. 'What sort of a dance is it?'  'Why,' said the Gryphon, 'you first form into a line along the sea-shore--'  'Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle. 'Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--'  'THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon. 
'--you advance twice--'  'Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon. 
'Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: 'advance twice, set to partners--'  '--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the Gryphon. 
'Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, 'you throw the--'  'The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air. 
'--as far out to sea as you can--'  'Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon. 
'Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about. 
'Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice. 
'Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice. 
'It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly. 
'Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle. 
'Very much indeed,' said Alice. 
'Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon. 'We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?'  'Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon. 'I've forgotten the words.'  So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly:--   '"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail. 
"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail. 
 See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!  They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance?   Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?  Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?   "You can really have no notion how delightful it will be  When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!"  But the snail replied "Too far, too far!" and gave a look askance--  Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance. 
 Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance. 
Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance. 
 '"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied. 
"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side. 
The further off from England the nearer is to France--  Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance. 
 Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?  Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?"'  'Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: 'and I do so like that curious song about the whiting!'  'Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, 'they--you've seen them, of course?'  'Yes,' said Alice, 'I've often seen them at dinn--' she checked herself hastily. 
'I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, 'but if you've seen them so often, of course you know what they're like.'  'I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully. 'They have their tails in their mouths--and they're all over crumbs.'  'You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle: 'crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails in their mouths; and the reason is--' here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.--'Tell her about the reason and all that,' he said to the Gryphon. 
'The reason is,' said the Gryphon, 'that they WOULD go with the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn't get them out again. That's all.'  'Thank you,' said Alice, 'it's very interesting. I never knew so much about a whiting before.'  'I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the Gryphon. 'Do you know why it's called a whiting?'  'I never thought about it,' said Alice. 'Why?'  'IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very solemnly. 
Alice was thoroughly puzzled. 'Does the boots and shoes!' she repeated in a wondering tone. 
'Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon. 'I mean, what makes them so shiny?'  Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her answer. 'They're done with blacking, I believe.'  'Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep voice, 'are done with a whiting. Now you know.'  'And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity. 
'Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: 'any shrimp could have told you that.'  'If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song, 'I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep back, please: we don't want YOU with us!"'  'They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle said: 'no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.'  'Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise. 
'Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle: 'why, if a fish came to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say "With what porpoise?"'  'Don't you mean "purpose"?' said Alice. 
'I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And the Gryphon added 'Come, let's hear some of YOUR adventures.'  'I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,' said Alice a little timidly: 'but it's no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.'  'Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle. 
'No, no! The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: 'explanations take such a dreadful time.'  So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating 'YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said 'That's very curious.'  'It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon. 
'It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. 'I should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to begin.' He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice. 
'Stand up and repeat "'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,"' said the Gryphon. 
'How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!' thought Alice; 'I might as well be at school at once.' However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very queer indeed:--    ''Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,   "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."   As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose   Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.'         [later editions continued as follows   When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,   And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,   But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,   His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]  'That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,' said the Gryphon. 
'Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; 'but it sounds uncommon nonsense.'  Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again. 
'I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle. 
'She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily. 'Go on with the next verse.'  'But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted. 'How COULD he turn them out with his nose, you know?'  'It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said; but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject. 
'Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently: 'it begins "I passed by his garden."'  Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--    'I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,   How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--'      [later editions continued as follows   The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,   While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat. 
 When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,   Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:   While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,   And concluded the banquet--]  'What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle interrupted, 'if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far the most confusing thing I ever heard!'  'Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon: and Alice was only too glad to do so. 
'Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the Gryphon went on. 'Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?'  'Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,' Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone, 'Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her "Turtle Soup," will you, old fellow?'  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing this:--     'Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,    Waiting in a hot tureen!    Who for such dainties would not stoop?    Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!    Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!      Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!      Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!    Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,      Beautiful, beautiful Soup!     'Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,    Game, or any other dish?    Who would not give all else for two    Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?    Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?      Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!      Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!    Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,      Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!'  'Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat it, when a cry of 'The trial's beginning!' was heard in the distance. 
'Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song. 
'What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only answered 'Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:--     'Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,      Beautiful, beautiful Soup!'     CHAPTER XI. Who Stole the Tarts?  The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--'I wish they'd get the trial done,' she thought, 'and hand round the refreshments!' But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about her, to pass away the time. 
Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there. 'That's the judge,' she said to herself, 'because of his great wig.'  The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming. 
'And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, 'and those twelve creatures,' (she was obliged to say 'creatures,' you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) 'I suppose they are the jurors.' She said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, 'jury-men' would have done just as well. 
The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. 'What are they doing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. 'They can't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun.'  'They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in reply, 'for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.'  'Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, 'Silence in the court!' and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking. 
Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down 'stupid things!' on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell 'stupid,' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. 'A nice muddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over!' thought Alice. 
One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate. 
'Herald, read the accusation!' said the King. 
On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--     'The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,       All on a summer day:     The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,       And took them quite away!'  'Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury. 
'Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. 'There's a great deal to come before that!'  'Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, 'First witness!'  The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. 'I beg pardon, your Majesty,' he began, 'for bringing these in: but I hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.'  'You ought to have finished,' said the King. 'When did you begin?'  The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. 'Fourteenth of March, I think it was,' he said. 
'Fifteenth,' said the March Hare. 
'Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse. 
'Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence. 
'Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter. 
'It isn't mine,' said the Hatter. 
'Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact. 
'I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation; 'I've none of my own. I'm a hatter.'  Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted. 
'Give your evidence,' said the King; 'and don't be nervous, or I'll have you executed on the spot.'  This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter. 
Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her. 
'I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her. 'I can hardly breathe.'  'I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: 'I'm growing.'  'You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse. 
'Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: 'you know you're growing too.'  'Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse: 'not in that ridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court. 
All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers of the court, 'Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!' on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off. 
'Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, 'or I'll have you executed, whether you're nervous or not.'  'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a trembling voice, '--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--'  'The twinkling of the what?' said the King. 
'It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied. 
'Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply. 'Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!'  'I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, 'and most things twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--'  'I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry. 
'You did!' said the Hatter. 
'I deny it!' said the March Hare. 
'He denies it,' said the King: 'leave out that part.'  'Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep. 
'After that,' continued the Hatter, 'I cut some more bread-and-butter--'  'But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked. 
'That I can't remember,' said the Hatter. 
'You MUST remember,' remarked the King, 'or I'll have you executed.'  The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went down on one knee. 'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he began. 
'You're a very poor speaker,' said the King. 
Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat upon it.)  'I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. 'I've so often read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court," and I never understood what it meant till now.'  'If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,' continued the King. 
'I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: 'I'm on the floor, as it is.'  'Then you may SIT down,' the King replied. 
Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed. 
'Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. 'Now we shall get on better.'  'I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers. 
'You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court, without even waiting to put his shoes on. 
'--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door. 
'Call the next witness!' said the King. 
The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once. 
'Give your evidence,' said the King. 
'Shan't,' said the cook. 
The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice, 'Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'  'Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, 'What are tarts made of?'  'Pepper, mostly,' said the cook. 
'Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her. 
'Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out. 'Behead that Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his whiskers!'  For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared. 
'Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief. 'Call the next witness.' And he added in an undertone to the Queen, 'Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead ache!'  Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, '--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name 'Alice!'     CHAPTER XII. Alice's Evidence   'Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before. 
'Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would die. 
'The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave voice, 'until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do. 
Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; 'not that it signifies much,' she said to herself; 'I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'  As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court. 
'What do you know about this business?' the King said to Alice. 
'Nothing,' said Alice. 
'Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King. 
'Nothing whatever,' said Alice. 
'That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury. They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted: 'UNimportant, your Majesty means, of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke. 
'UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and went on to himself in an undertone,  'important--unimportant--unimportant--important--' as if he were trying which word sounded best. 
Some of the jury wrote it down 'important,' and some 'unimportant.' Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates; 'but it doesn't matter a bit,' she thought to herself. 
At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book, cackled out 'Silence!' and read out from his book, 'Rule Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'  Everybody looked at Alice. 
'I'M not a mile high,' said Alice. 
'You are,' said the King. 
'Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen. 
'Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: 'besides, that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now.'  'It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King. 
'Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice. 
The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. 'Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice. 
'There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; 'this paper has just been picked up.'  'What's in it?' said the Queen. 
'I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, 'but it seems to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'  'It must have been that,' said the King, 'unless it was written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'  'Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen. 
'It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; 'in fact, there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.' He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added 'It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of verses.'  'Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of the jurymen. 
'No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, 'and that's the queerest thing about it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)  'He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King. (The jury all brightened up again.)  'Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, 'I didn't write it, and they can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.'  'If you didn't sign it,' said the King, 'that only makes the matter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your name like an honest man.'  There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day. 
'That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen. 
'It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. 'Why, you don't even know what they're about!'  'Read them,' said the King. 
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. 'Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?' he asked. 
'Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, 'and go on till you come to the end: then stop.'  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--     'They told me you had been to her,     And mentioned me to him:    She gave me a good character,     But said I could not swim. 
   He sent them word I had not gone     (We know it to be true):    If she should push the matter on,     What would become of you?     I gave her one, they gave him two,     You gave us three or more;    They all returned from him to you,     Though they were mine before. 
   If I or she should chance to be     Involved in this affair,    He trusts to you to set them free,     Exactly as we were. 
   My notion was that you had been     (Before she had this fit)    An obstacle that came between     Him, and ourselves, and it. 
   Don't let him know she liked them best,     For this must ever be    A secret, kept from all the rest,     Between yourself and me.'  'That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,' said the King, rubbing his hands; 'so now let the jury--'  'If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting him,) 'I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'  The jury all wrote down on their slates, 'SHE doesn't believe there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to explain the paper. 
'If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, 'that saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one eye; 'I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave. 
The Knave shook his head sadly. 'Do I look like it?' he said. (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)  'All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself: '"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's the jury, of course--"I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'  'But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said Alice. 
'Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the table. 'Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my dear, I think?' he said to the Queen. 
'Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)  'Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round the court with a smile. There was a dead silence. 
'It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, 'Let the jury consider their verdict,' the King said, for about the twentieth time that day. 
'No, no!' said the Queen. 'Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'  'Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. 'The idea of having the sentence first!'  'Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple. 
'I won't!' said Alice. 
'Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved. 
'Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time.) 'You're nothing but a pack of cards!'  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face. 
'Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; 'Why, what a long sleep you've had!'  'Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, 'It WAS a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.' So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been. 
But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister's dream. 
The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle. 
So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs. 
Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.

　　龍會蘭池錄
　　宋南渡，汴郡中都路人蔣生世隆，年弱冠，學行名時，以韓蘇自許，凡天下
名士，傾貲相結納。金逃將蒲興福，拜為異姓兄弟。興福仇家高琪朮虎索之甚急
，世隆乃贐別於蔣家村。臨行間，以杭筆為約，各有詩贈，具錄於此。世隆詩曰
：
　　水萍相遇自天涯，文武崢嶸興莫賒。
　　仇國有心追季布，蓬門無膽作朱家。
　　蛟龍豈是池中物，珠翠終成錦上花。
　　此去從伊攜手處，相聯奎璧耀江華　　
　　興福詩曰：
　　金戈耀日阻生涯，鵬鳥何當比海賒。
　　楚王不知伊負國，子胥怎放父冤家。
　　情深淵海杯中酒，義重丘山萼上花。
　　直到臨安桃浪暖，一門朱紫共榮華。
　　彼時興福百口家眷俱沒金都，惟興福寸鐵衛身，萬夫莫敵，後得投於世隆。
時欲歸宋，又恐蹈於故轍，乃樹跖旗於蕉葦間，變易姓名，人莫知之。雖李妙真
亦以敵相遇，橫行江上。閒居山寨，每有鴻鵠沖天之想，口記詩詞甚多，聊記一
二附覽。詩曰：
　　九代簪纓顯大功，炮花煙散霎時中。
　　望門誰信無張儉，窩我公然有祝融。
　　鸞鳳何堪棲枳棘，蛟龍畢竟動天風。
　　又詩曰：
　　虎頭山寨勢威威，韓白英雄建將標。
　　江上老人恩未報，簣中亡命恨難消。
　　雲關不鎖歸鄉望，星帳猶疑趕早朝。
　　何日紫微開泰運，龍泉斂口贊蕭曹。
　　時金迫元兵，自中都徙汴。宋邊城近汴者，又迫金兵而杭。光州固始黃尚書
復家，從眾南奔。時復受韓冑命，訓稿江淮。家中藏獲，一時瓦解。惟復妻暨一
女同奔，名曰瑞蘭，年方十八，才色冠世。蓋初生時，家有楊妃蘭，獨豔一枝，
異香經月。尚書執瑞蘭之兆，每以椒禁是圖，凡有求婚者，而不之允。至是遇難
，彷徨草野，女謂母曰：「昔有黃公生二女甚美，詐名醜陋，卒無問者。今亂離中
宜用此策。」乃塗抹似癩婦，往來莫有觀者，時夜宿荒村，口占詩詞，聊記其形
跡云：
　　天驕肆馬下南都，煙火凌空淚寡孤。
　　燕雀問巢何處有，雞豚尋屋舊人無。
　　玉顏今信為身累，肉食誰能為國謀？　
　　安得華夷歸一統，太平臣子共三呼。
　　世隆新築精舍，期通萬軸以魁天下士，平居自許曰：「大丈夫功名當玉彩
，事業須韓，范，鷦鷯一枝，何足軒輊！」年已二十，玉猶未種。有妹名瑞蓮
，絲亦不牽於人，蓋其心之所圖者大，匪夷所思。今倏遭亂，兄妹相攜而遁。
夜宿林薄間，詩詞甚多，不能盡錄，聊記《虞美人》詞云：
　　生平不誤解鄉曲，燈下書懷足；老天作忠噴豺狼，萬萬千千，鼠竄鬧彷徨。
家山一夢知何處，兄妹淚如雨。何時玉燭再光輝，把我六親骨肉完璧歸。
　　又詩曰：
　　天步殷憂鬼亦愁，控弦百萬出幽州。
　　紅顏路上啼王嬙，黎首林間聚楚囚。
　　當國豪雄心作劍，邊城將校血成油。
　　何時天地能開泰，南北生靈喜不休。
　　金聞元追宋，又防金兵馬縱橫。大散關上，瑞蘭失母，世隆失妹。適宋孟珙
、趙方剋金兵，人定相尋，莫知去向。瑞蘭母，湯思退女，得世隆妹林下，偕往
和州，世隆遍尋妹，「蓮」「蘭」音似，瑞蘭聞名，自石竇中出。一見世隆，方知
其非母氏。諗詢來歷，皆逃兵人。世隆見瑞蘭有殊色，目送良久，曰：「不意草萊
中有此奇怪，信所謂非習而見之者以為神矣。」瑞蘭見世隆容聲儒雅，亦見其芹
泮中人，心其屬之。世隆疑其羅敷，語，實乃女子，約為婚姻，乃偕入浙。
　　瑞蘭徐行，口占一調寫懷。世隆聞之，歎曰：「吾只為卿有國色，不意又有天才
。千載奇逢，間世之數也。」口占一詩以戲之，瑞蘭亦和之。
　　瑞蘭調云（《虞美人》）：
　　弓鞋小，徑路險崔巍。豎只應隨鹿去，燕孩安可傍鷹飛？事爭且相隨。鄉天杳，
惆悵幾時歸？風打柳腰南北轉，雨催花淚長短垂。雲散月將輝。
　　世隆詩：
　　胡馬嘶風鬧北邊，好花散落石崖前。
　　喜伊千里來相見，愧我何當任二天。
　　琴上未彈凰覓鳳，叢中自信雀逢鷹。
　　古稱樂重親知己，粉面休須暗淚漣。
　　瑞蘭詩：
　　冒鋒骯髒遍山邊，觸目傷心步不前。
　　廊廟無人能捧日，江湖有我亦憂天。
　　孤行險逕因隨虎，鳥入深絲只為鷹。
　　回首鄉山千萬里，羅襟無奈淚漣漣。
　　於時世隆瑞蘭行向五關，一道坦夷。村居野宿，皆群官族。世隆於瑞蘭，但
目成影望而已。至新安境，星散墜分－世隆獨攜瑞蘭荊山而南。時興福倚江行劫
，路轉烏林，鉦鼓喧天，旌旗蔽野。瑞蘭計無所逃，竟欲自裁。世隆固止之，指
匿蔽於樹中，獨向麾前請命。行三十餘步，中間主將則興福也。倏見間，投戈下
拜。各道詳曲，且喜且悲。世隆乃向樹出瑞蘭，興福執義嫂叔禮見甚恭。瑞蘭固
請行。世隆乃別曰：「君獨不識戴淵耶？」興福曰：「兄來，則陸機矣。何言期青
蠅報市，會於臨安。」興福贐世隆金帛數百，指瀟湘鎮路最寧。世隆曰：「承教。
」遂別就道。
　　世隆瑞蘭出芝山北路，雖康洞蓬艾森，世隆口占詩詞，挑瑞蘭野合。瑞蘭亦
口占拒之。世隆迫於私，有無賴狀，蘭泣曰：「妾豈不近人情者哉！謔麻贈芍藥，
胡為至於我耶？」世隆歎曰：「古人謂雞肋，食則無肉，棄則可惜，正予今日事矣
。」蘭誓不允，世隆亦喜其執義之是，其時詩詞，聊記於此，以為有識者逆志云。
　　世隆詩云：
　　一枝芍藥出天京，板蕩誰為萬里城。
　　杜珏已能擒叛虎，張生安肯放孤鶯。
　　蒼麻帳裡花雙美，綠草氈中日五更。
　　莫待明朝萍水散，人從何處問卿卿。
　　瑞蘭詩云：
　　病腳崎嶇死一般，眼眶無盡淚潺潺。
　　鴛鴦野合顏何厚，蝨在風中骨亦寒。
　　我願愆期游洞府，君休設計斬花關。
　　若將再問玉珊事，龍女雙班入越山。
　　又世隆長短名：
　　君不見神女出高唐，暮雨朝雲戀楚王。西華岳裡注生娘，玉釵脫下付劉郎。
又不見岳陽樓上何仙姑，洞賓醉裡戲葫蘆。十二珠簾花落盡，飛身便過洞庭湖。
神仙自古盡貪凡，洞府誰能保萬全。伊人不是貪脂粉，伊人無奈惜芳年。可憐薄
倖無相愛，有情終不似無情。車欲直，馬欲橫，鳳凰不肯笑相鳴。早知分薄空相見
，曾似當初獨自行。獨自行，安得許多驚。獨行還得無擔累，獨行何有心如碎。
心如碎，人成鬼，人成鬼兮正為誰？今朝擔帶許多難，今朝節節骨生寒。夢裡不
知身是客，茫中還要戀虛歡。臨安三百里，一望石雲間。鶴去也，石台閒。石台閒
，春色緣何得再看。天漢漢，路漫漫，安得神翁加撮合，赤繩囊裡赤繩纏。流水不推
自然急，浪頭風送載花船。
　　瑞蘭調云（《朝中措》）：
　　日色映流霞，手爪亂交加。憶昔當年貴重，今朝錯落風沙。
　　紅顏薄命，路旁債主，眼下冤家。不謂今宵浪靜，鉦鏜怎樣催花。
　　還照間，方至瀟湘鎮。呂文德初為鎮尉，一方倚為金城。士民安堵，市肆行
商多叢聚其間。世隆住瑞蘭於迎芳亭，遴得大邸，乃引瑞蘭入邸。邸居鎮央，主人
則黃思古也。外設行房十餘，以待羈旅，內設大廈三所，以承宦族。每所琴棋書畫。
花木芬芳。世隆喜其清致。不吝賃貲。駐足少頃，則有奚僮二人、丫鬟二人，爨湯設
酒，奉承澡飲。時瑞蘭新浴出，蓬鬢鳳姿，分外逼人。世隆迎視欲狂，笑曰：「真所謂
天下一女矣。」口占五言詩十二韻贈諸。奉酒間，瑞蘭亦占一律以復。至於酒聖酒賢
、平原青州，絕不入口。世隆固強諸飲，瑞蘭固怯。世隆頓杯起曰：「計欲助海棠春睡耳
，豈真以宰革啖宋萬耶！」亦不終席而罷。
　　世隆詩云：
　　主人思古黃，借我一仙房；眼下風塵客，杯中荳蔻湯。掩扉推繡履，倚几脫羅裳。
雪貌消浮屠，冰肌覺淨涼。瓊花開后土，玉樹沃雲漿。妃子嬌無力，胎儀體自香。衝鋒
疑未允，想象興何當。浪靜登仙鋒，煙開下客廊。牡丹新出水，天馬暗行疆。對面如千里
，描情賴一觴。桃花心未動，柳絮性徒狂。安得何仙子，今宵醉岳陽。
　　瑞蘭調云（《賣花聲》）：
　　胡馬渡銀河，鬧動干戈。蒙君福蔭千萬多，此意此情終有報，君莫蹉跎。----送我歸
鄉窠，媒結藤蘿。一生緣分屬哥哥。要把風花閒地設，這事難呵！　　
　　薄夜燈明，侍婢進安眠酒，世隆怒不沾唇。瑞蘭起奉，十分款曲。世隆曰：卿奉酒，
乃范彈冠縷耳，豈真情耶？」蘭曰：「君勿太誣人。」世隆曰：「非誣卿也，正醉重瞳脫沛
公計耳。」蘭笑而止。世隆曰：「死者復生，生不愧死，桑林美約，今亡矣夫！」蘭曰：
「妾非輕諾寡信者，第以義有不可耳。」世隆曰：「何不可？」蘭曰：「使君自有婦，羅敷自
有夫。」世隆曰：「是何言也。生雀未射而卿關女，又於鼻頸徵之矣。」瑞蘭語塞：「將身
攜重寶，效蔡琰贖。」世隆笑曰：「吾儒家書中金屋車馬，等閒事耳，奚重寶為！」蘭曰
：「書中有女顏如玉，何用妾之棄人？」世隆曰：「國色非書中有也。」瑞蘭覘世隆意篤，
佯如廁，兔脫東房。世隆忿不自勝，如焚如割，即房窗間諭以一歌。瑞蘭亦制一調以寬之。
　　世隆歌云：
　　生平不識亦風流，偶遇神仙下楚州。
　　人眼人間何處是，天然的礫掛心頭。
　　五關幸脫單于老，烏林又遇孫彪到。
　　伊人保護不勝多，擔盡千煩與萬惱。
　　今朝平步入瀟湘，擬將雲雨遍牙牀。
　　誰知酒後機心變，翻身逸走入東房。
　　東房門戶壯秦關，萬方挑戰盡空還。
　　心頭悸亂渾如醉，身上慌忙骨自寒。
　　嗚呼已矣蔣世隆。無限恩情一夢中，
　　有緣千里終相逢。人生爭似玉人身，
　　玉人身上不相離。暮隨帳裡溫香體，
　　朝隨鏡下畫蛾眉。當年恩愛欲何如，
　　今宵恩愛只如此。弓藏鳥盡竟何言？
　　惱殺牡丹花下死。花下死兮奈渠何。
　　奈渠何兮無奈何，窗前咫尺天涯遠，
　　唱破人間薄倖歌。
　　瑞蘭調云（《水龍吟》）：
　　強胡百萬長驅，邊城瓦解人如草。風流才子，桑林絕處，奴家作靠。一路扶持萬千
，又脫鳥林凶盜。這恩情許大，銘心刻骨，豈甘丟倒。----送我歸家下落，把全身從容
圖報。一枝芍藥倍紅，百歲春光偕老。看人間野合鴛鴦，羞殺我，君休道。
　　世隆曰：「卿欲歸家圖，不惟劉備寬荊州歲月，亦張儀以商於誑楚耶？」瑞蘭曰：
「豈敢為是哉。所以歸家者，正欲白雙親，備六禮，百歲咸恒，使君得為良士夫，妾
不失為相門子女。私自擇配，魯姬所以玷於曾子來也。」世隆聞相門之說，訊其實，
方知乃祖丞相黃潛善，乃翁尚書復。沉想良久，雖憐其流落，益自喜其佳遇，則曰：「崔
鶯非相女耶？自送佳期，至今雙美。今娘子所遭之難固大於崔氏，而不念我耶？」蘭曰：
「崔氏自獻其身，乃有尤物之議，卒焉改適鄭恒，今以為羞。妾欲歸家圖報者，正以此患
耳。」世隆曰：「卿言乃鷓鴣啼耳。」蘭曰：「何也？」世隆曰：「行不得哥哥。」蘭曰：「
無患也，至則行矣。」世隆曰：「決行不得。一至卿家，貅關獒守，因鬼見帝渴睡，莫敢強
委命哉！」蘭曰哉：妾自有處，何煩君慮。」世隆曰：「彼時亦不得自主也，況重寶名重天
下，求之者眾，生恐鹿走他人，徒負喬知之綠珠怨耳。」蘭曰：「君獨不識鍾建負我者哉？
妾以此言告君，寧不三骰十九色於君耶？」世隆曰：「卿欲季乾，恐尚書不楚王何。」蘭曰
：「妾籌之熟矣，保無恙。」世隆曰：「生今涸魚掉尾，寧待西江水以求活耶？」蘭曰：「採
葉與自落，遲速無幾何。」世隆曰：「巧遲不如拙速，況事急矣，才說姑待明日，亦不可也
。」蘭曰：「急客緩主人，千日亦須等待，安得荷劍逐蠅耶？」世隆曰：「如卿言，我絕望矣
。」遂制《瀟湘夢》一詞以別之。詞曰：
　　笳鼓喧天，貔貅無數。玉仙子桑下相逢，再天懇怙。醜豺狼不諳光景，把親妹丟開忘顧
。攜手向南行，看一枝好處。萬萬千千湊補，誰料風平浪靜，翻旗覆鼓。羅帶壯金湯，又把重
門深固。千婉轉，萬婉轉，張目挺身，恁我怎生擺佈？何謂當日我如山，何謂今朝我如虎？不
念我一途風露，好多辛苦。懷盡了山盟野誓，變盡了雲朝雨暮。看世上人間，唯有這個婦人銅
肝鐵肚。天兮天兮何訴！從今割斷虛花債，明月三更，卿也去，我也東走，莫把有情風月，著
這無情耽誤。再不回頭也，有這個冤家，花下都是黃泉路。嗚呼！一曲瀟湘詞，今宵懊恨為誰
秦？送卿去也，永作欺人話譜。
　　瑞蘭聞其詞，且驚且喜，推戶出曰：「晉國亦仕國也，未聞仕如此其急也。」世隆曰：「
既云仕國，君子之難仕，何也？」瑞蘭曰：「其如玉盞下地何！」世隆曰：「桑海亦有田時，
不必更多說。」摟以就寢。瑞蘭曰：「妾尚葳蕤，未堪屑越。願君智及而行之以仁，幸甚。」
世隆曰：「謹領。」方會間，瑞蘭半推半就，羅襪含羞卸，銀燈帶笑吹。再三叮嚀，千萬護持
。翡翠衾中，桃花浪轉，支左吾右，幾不能勝。腰倦鬢鬆，扶而不起，仔細溫存而已。頃之
，漸入佳境。妙自天然，假非人間有者。雖蘭橋、巫峽、芙蓉城之遇，殆未能加於此。信是
一刻千金，只恐春宵不永者矣。雲收雨霽，瑞蘭以妖娘漬者指示世隆，曰：「不意道旁一驪龍
珠為君摘碎，敗麟殘甲，萬勿棄置。」世隆曰：「千里馬骨猶值五百金，況真千里馬者哉！勿
慮。」時世隆遇異心忙，彷彿如夢。頃之，乃其真也，又皇皇然，而有所求。瑞蘭將堅晉鄙
，但平符既竊，鐵錐又至，一夜花城，兵將折衝，似不能支。時有口占詩詞甚多，聊記一二
，以表龍會蘭池之行實云。
　　世隆詩云：
　　生平不省入花關，倏到花關骨盡寒；
　　焚玉謾誇游楚峽，巫神今夜下巫山。
　　帕污未破紅梅子，被暖能言白牡丹。
　　寄語載花船上客，後灘風浪易前難。
　　瑞蘭詩云：
　　生平不省出堂階，草昧叨逢蔣秀才。
　　明月幾曾廂下待，好花卻就路旁開。
　　山盟應許藏金匱，春興猶疑竊玉釵。
　　為道葳蕤渾未慣，春風消息謾重來。
　　世隆詩曰：
　　冒盡風波上釣台，夜光珠裡蚌初開。
　　捫心難捨天然色，信口方知不世才。
　　窗下只驚花下死，枕中宜向月中來。
　　夜深不是貪重餌，冒盡風波上釣台。
　　瑞蘭和云：
　　今宵不負望英台，架上薔薇帶血開。
　　愧我本無傾國色，喜君真有冠天才。
　　金沙江裡風初過，雲夢山間雨又來。
　　一路花籌都算盡，今宵不負望英台。
　　世隆會真三十韻：
　　仙子生光國，胡囚出北畿。山村逃猾虜，桑野拜新知。張珙扶崔女，鍾郎負楚姬。
心明非是伴，事迫且相隨。鴛鴦羞苟合，鷸蚌苦相持。結草恩何在，看花願已違。
更猜韓信走，又慮相公追。函谷關雖固，金牛路上低。窗前伸鬱抑，几上悶躊躇。
擬斷華歆席，笑開楊素扉。羅襠含愧卸，銀燭趁慌吹。神女初登峽，天孫懶上機。
花心紅杏小，遍體白鵝肥。怕殺江風惡，叮嚀舟楫遲。鶯銜珠串起，風轉鬢雲欹。
懶散嬌無力，分明忍皺眉。細餐甘欖味，剝落雞頭皮。鏖戰渾如夢，綢繆肉似泥。
疑成連理骨，化作一團坯。忘卻誰為我，何知我有伊。歡娛難口說，妙處自心知。
雲雨重重報，陽春點點迷。會真何日了，萬古話佳期。
　　世隆會瑞蘭後，日夜衽席花酒。瑞蘭每以晉侯六疾戒世隆。世隆曰：「我自樂此
，不為疲也。」瑞蘭曰：「世豈有酒色交攻而不敗者乎？嘗有詩云：『鳥低山木，猶巢
其顛；魚淺淵泉，又定其窟。』」又曰：「握月擔風，罔思後日；迷花亂酒，取足今時。」
又有云：「酒後人為席，不顧千金之體；花中日作宵，恐孤百歲之期。」又曰：
「兩斧伐孤樹，君自為之；鉤月帶三星，吾不忍也。」啟詞駢驪，多有不述。
世隆雖奇其才而重其心，但惑溺已深，擷取倍於他日。嘗有芳詠甚多，聊記其略，
以彰意云。
　　世隆短篇：
　　天若不愛色，星宿無牛女。地若不愛色，木無連理枝。天地都愛色，
吾人當何如。古稱花似色，將花一論之。惜花鬚起早，誰肯看花遲？折花鬚
折蕊，誰肯戀空枝？花色有時盡，人有年老時，及時愛花色，莫待過時悲。
　　世隆詩詞意雖陋，亦風月家所有。瑞蘭見之，忸怩曰：「如君詩見天下，
妾之名節掃地矣。不但妾羞，亦天下婦人羞。」世隆曰：「玉真夜半私語，崔鶯
二十年前曉寺，亦誰為之？」瑞蘭曰：「崔鶯二十年前乃自陳之，其羞郎之心猶在
。若玉真夜半私語，乃好事者筆力，何以為玉真羞？」乃相攜拜月於東庭。世隆顧
謂瑞蘭曰：「月白風清，如此良夜何。」因會王亭，遂擬亭日「拜月」，制《拜月亭賦
》及《花房十詠》於此云。
　　拜月亭賦：
　　臘月既望，蔣子游於瀟湘之亭，天光如晝，萬籟無聲。博山香熾，銀燭初明，
欄杆十二，花稍倒影。百卉春芳，淡風暗隨。方俯仰間，有一異人，降之於庭。裳
裳縹緲，殘妝不整，微笑春生，蓮步散行。似非塵寰慣見，不預花木儲精，豔奪瑤池
之王母，羞壞座上之飛瓊。心通麻飯，情重蓉城，思而難得，疑而後驚。恍惚少定，
乃前拜曰：『昔莊周夢為蝴蝶，初不知孰為莊周，孰為蝴蝶。予今見異人於庭，初不知
孰為異人，孰為嫦娥。是知嫦娥者，天之異人也；異人者，地之嫦娥也。莊周以夢子
以真，但為雲階下拜，而不俟於西廂待矣。』樂甚，把酒為之一問曰：『予言何如？
』異人曰：『然。』乃相與歌曰：『異人非我兮，誰為之夫？我非異人兮，誰為之婦
？今宵非月兮，誰為之媒？天為幄兮地為茵，風前一枕，月其主之，何必再問於繩
絲之老人？』
　　春宵十詠：
　　少年紅粉共風流，錦帳春宵戀不休；
　　興魄罔知來客館，狂魂疑似入仙舟。
　　臉紅暗染胭脂汗，面白誤污粉黛油；
　　一倒一顛眠不得，雞聲唱破五更秋。
　　其二曰：
　　對壘牙牀起戰戈，兩身合一暗推磨。
　　採花戲喋吮花髓，戀蜜狂蜂隱蜜窠。
　　粉汗身中乾又溫，雲鬟枕上起猶作。
　　此緣此樂真無比，獨步風流第一科。
　　其三曰：
　　梅花帳裡笑相從，興逸難當屢折衝。
　　百媚生春魂自亂，三峰剪彩骨都融。
　　情超楚王朝雲夢，樂過飛瓊曉露蹤。
　　當戀不甘纖刻斷，雞聲漫唱五更鐘。
　　其四曰：
　　二八嬌嬈冰月精，道旁不吝好風情。
　　花心柔軟春含露，柳骨葳蕤夜宿鶯。
　　枕上雲收雙困倦，夢中蝶鎖幾縱橫。
　　何緣天借人方便，平露為涼六七更。
　　其五曰：
　　如此風流興莫支，好花含笑雨淋漓。
　　心慌枕上顰西子，體倦牀中洗祿兒。
　　妙處不容言語狀，嬌時偏向眼眉知。
　　何須再道中間事，連理枝頭連理枝。
　　其六曰：
　　邸深人靜快春宵，心絮紛紛骨盡消。
　　花吐曾將化蕊破，柳垂復把柳枝搖。
　　金槍鏖戰三千陣，銀燭光臨七八嬌。
　　不礙兩身肌骨阻，更祛一捲去雲橋。
　　其七曰：
　　仙子嬌嬈骨肉均，芳心共醉碧羅茵。
　　情真既肇桃源會，妙促西施柳葉顰。
　　洞裡泉生方寸地，花間蝶戀一團春。
　　分明汝我難分辨，天賜人間吻合人。
　　其八曰：
　　花兵月陣暗交攻，久慣營城一路通。
　　白雪消時還有白，紅花落盡更無紅。
　　寸心獨曉泉流下，萬樂誰知火熱中。
　　信是將軍多便益，起來卻是五更鐘。
　　其九曰：
　　兩身香汗暗沾濡，陣陣春風透玉壺。
　　樂處疏通迎刃劍，摭機流轉走盤珠。
　　褥中推枕真如醉，酒後添杯爭似無。
　　一點花心消滅盡，文君謾訝瘦相如。
　　其十曰：
　　暗芳驅迫興難禁，洞口陽春淺復深。
　　綠樹帶風翻翠浪，紅花冒雨透芳心。
　　幾番枕上聯雙玉，寸刻闈中當萬金。
　　爾我謾言貪此樂，神仙到此也生淫。
　　世隆色度太過，汞鉛戕而榮衛枯，病幾不振。瑞蘭驚悸。明有鎮山廟海神甚靈
，瑞蘭將命奚童禱。世隆雖病，語瑞蘭曰：「世豈有禱於神而不死者乎？蓋今之神，
古之人。神嘗不能自宥其死，況能宥其死於人乎？」瑞蘭曰：「何以見之？」世隆曰：
「予嘗稽董狐《搜神鬼記》，釋迦乃維摩王子。觀音，妙莊王女。達摩至盧能，托蘆傳
缽六葉，卒於漢溪。佛祖則宜春縣人，曰即肅。老君則楚縣人，曰李耳。張真人道陵，
乃漢張良後。許真人遜，晉零陵令。吳真人猛，時真人奇，皆晉時人。天王封於唐太宗
征高麗間。福神蔣子死於鍾山下。唐葛週三將軍，周宣王時人。趙玄壇名公明，秦始皇
時高士。關公羽封義勇武安王，始於宋道君。茅君匡裕，廬山法祖。鍾馗受享，自玄宗
一夢。萬回國公，又張家子。灶神張單，廁神何麗卿，戶神彭質、彭君、彭矯。虐神，
顓頊三太子。厲神曰伯張，隋朝乃見。火回祿，水玄冥，備存左氏。卿何苦而惑之？」
瑞蘭曰：「禱禳古有之，子產亦公孫泄良止，而鄭人安況病一人耶？」世隆曰：「左氏所
以為誣也。夫海神廣利廣德，又有曰天妃敕封護國庇民，而強盜海中，專借其力於舟楫
風波之中，顧乃受其享獻，樂其金帛，縱盜害民，其可勝記！信神明之最靈者莫如海神
，既不能靈於海盜，顧能靈於我耶？卿勿復言」瑞蘭曰：「痊病有貳道，巫與醫而已，君
其欲醫乎？」世隆喜而從之，得折肱家而克濟。但世隆病中每念於花月，蘭以死拒，乃
止，嘗稽其醫中詩詠一二，以備玩焉。
　　藥名詩曰：
　　血蠍天雄紫石英，前胡巴戟指南星。
　　相思子也忘知母，虞美人兮幸寄生。
　　鶯宿全朝當白芷，馬牙何日熟黃精。
　　蛇牀蟬腿漸陽起，芎藥枝頭萬斛情。
　　藥方詩曰：
　　國老不能和百藥，將軍無計掃餘殃。
　　黃連何為連身苦，龍骨應知骨自香。
　　吐露清愁情已闕，金花在目興應忙。
　　蛇牀獨活相思子，此德當歸續命湯。
　　世隆病漸痊。主人思古邀梨園子弟侑賀於西閣。世隆起見，笑曰：「此頑童也
，生所羞比。」思古曰：「何謂頑童？」世隆曰：「具載三風十愆中。」思古意猶
未解。世隆具以晉姜男破老，漢弄兒來夢兒，太子承幹事告。思古乃出淨酒奉喜
。席罷，瑞蘭曰：「妾聞黃公媼言，地中病者，非傀儡侑神，則有梨園子弟，舍
是則病後有變。」世隆曰：「傀儡制自師涓，以怒紂，陳孺子竊之以助漢，何為
禍？何為福？況梨園所演，一皆虛誕。蔡伯喈孝感鶴鳥，指為無親；趙朔亡而
謂借代於酒堅，韓厥立趙後而為伏劍於後宰門，晉靈公命獒犬、
　　張彌以殺趙盾，乃歸之屠氏，膳夫蒸熊掌不熟，斷其手指，以人掌代熊掌。
男人莫看《西廂》，女人莫看《東牆》，固以元稹之薄，秀英之陋，然始終苟合，
亦非實事，陳湘受月梅寫帕之投，終為夫婦。郭華吞月英繡鞋之污，卒幾於死，
或冒為《玉匣》。蕭氏之夫本漢婁敬，詐曰文龍。劉智遠之祖本於沙陀，詐曰漢裔
。以蘇秦之游說，雲長之忠義，寇準之於舜英，蒙正之於千金，皆非所演，中體
能從其侑賀，只自誣耳，又豈可允從之哉？」瑞蘭曰：「非兄熟於故典，何以到此
。」乃相攜出於邸樓門。樓亦佳境，四窗天設圖畫，簾泊燕鶯，日供弦管，人如
在華胥中。世隆強瑞蘭立會，蘭曰：「白龍魚渚烏乎可？」世隆曰：「楚王蘭台景
也，何妨。」時有口占一律，以示意云。
　　世隆詩曰：
　　神仙自古好樓居，樓上風流更有餘。
　　柳骨經霜爭似舊，花心冒雨謾如初。
　　洞賓破橘描飛鶴，妃子沉香引醉魚。
　　昨夜星家應駭月，女牛出局會天墟。
　　世隆樓會後，又犯陰陽。瑞蘭曰：「大丈夫何不自拔至是耶？」世隆曰：「
其如花神迫人何？」瑞蘭曰：「妾無賴之過也。願君千萬珍重。」時烏鴉日噪
，蘭心驚有大故。世隆曰：「王梅溪謂鴉為忠臣，東方朔占鴉吉多凶少。卿非
夷隸治，何以識其音，顧亦驚之若是耶？」蘭曰：「不但此也，妾亦多異夢。
」世隆曰：「從心莫如夢，卿心予病故耳。」瑞蘭曰：「夢關人者大。鶴九其
齡，羊存其身，射月炊臼，朱箜先進第十一，皆以夢得之。妾夢異，必有異
事，非關君病而已。」方議論間，牀幃忽然自裂，瑞蘭泣下。世隆曰：「變怪
亦不足深信，犬作人言，猿代婢爨，鼠談客死，杯酒化血，鼓出於庭，未聞竟
為凶也。」瑞蘭曰：「君徒以大口誣人耳。妾自保一死足矣。」潸然而淚。世隆
曰：「卿勿憂，我以未病卜之。」時甲寅已卜，得澤水困卦，甲應已體，犯三刑
五位，卯才逢劫，子地合父，入空騰蛇，又臨應動。世隆始懼，曰：「非我絕子
，子將絕我矣。」乃作詩禳之。
　　世隆詩曰：
　　乾坤丕泰萬濟屯，已過師中尚旅塵。
　　未濟當時成既濟，同人何日見家人。
　　騰蛇直應妻逢劫，驛馬臨時父合身。
　　只喜眼前些少好，陰將陽掩不勝春。
　　瑞蘭曰：「如君詩，是亦李崔州寇萊州渡海讖矣。」　
　　言未幾，聞庭外聲，瑞蘭出覘簾下，則一鸚鵒棲庭檜，隸役紛紛呼引不歸。
鸚鵒見瑞蘭，飛入叩頭呼曰：「玉娘子萬福。」－－蓋鸚鵒乃尚書向使虜得之，養
十餘年，名曰飛郎。有古徐丞相比歸，隸役欲入取，飛郎歸驛報尚書曰：「瑞蘭娘
子在那大屋間。」尚書命庶男留兒跟往。－－蓋留兒乃尚書侍婢所生，母棄亂中
而留其兒，因名曰留兒－－一至黃公店，見瑞蘭於廊右，相持而泣，從者又達尚
書來，父子相見，哀惻過甚。世隆聞之，曰：「怪今至矣，奈何！」尚書詢其因，
瑞蘭陳之至」寄身世隆」處，尚書悵然曰：「壞我楊妃蘭矣！」敕令同歸瑞蘭曰：「
桃花犬猶不忘主，蛩蛩巨虛，何曾負汝？況瑞蘭以人名，可以鳥喙耶？」尚書曰：「
爾忘父母，則梟獍矣，其罪尤大。」瑞蘭曰：「前日瑞蘭，則父母之子，今日瑞蘭，
則世隆之妻，本匏蠶女，從夫婦耶，抑從父母耶？」尚書曰：「汝忘大史，而棄後氏
耶？」瑞蘭曰：「後氏私法章於家，罪在後氏。瑞蘭以世隆為鍾建，時無昭王，私作樂
尹，罪固不專在於瑞蘭。」尚書曰：「父一而已，汝獨不念蔡仲耶。」復又曰：「汝不行，
我將以沉香母待汝矣。」蘭泣曰：「傅殷為龍女傳書，洞庭君尤高其義，懇為婚姻，況人扶
瑞蘭於難，今又臥病於牀，使瑞蘭遽從父歸，令人飲恨九泉，瑞蘭安忍為之！」尚書亦憐
之，乃令引出。
　　瑞蘭入，謂世隆曰：「妾知有今日事久矣，徒君不入人言耳。」時世隆病殘骨立
，瑞蘭扶出，祝曰：「舉棋不定，弗勝其偶，君尚捫蝨對桓溫，勿視其巍巍然，否則樂
昌鏡破矣。」世隆曰：「我今無能為也。但以卿為泰山耳。」出見尚書，不能自立坐，仆
於東坡椅上。尚書怒曰：「豈以碧紗籠中乘龍耶？」瑞蘭曰：「呂蒙正亦以渴睡漢受欺，
狀元天下將何如？」尚書曰：「不必言，世豈有此人能乘風破萬里浪乎？」瑞蘭曰：「古
稱美人者，漢李夫人，猶曰『吾病久色衰』，今世隆色因病耳。願尚書且效平原君，以毛
遂備數。」尚書怒，世隆起而入。
　　尚書隨拘黃思古家長幼立階下，欲為打鴨驚鴛鴦計。思古舉家驚怖，因勸分異者
，瑞蘭久之乃詐入整妝，贈世隆以半衫，曰：「此浣火也，來日以此為約。」盤桓顧盼
，不忍倏離。尚書立迫，瑞蘭忿恨氣絕。尚書命留兒扶之，登車而去。其時相別詩調，
亦有可憐者，具錄於此。
　　瑞蘭調《一剪梅》云：
　　瀟湘店外鬼來呵，愁殺哥哥，悶殺哥哥。伊人自作撲燈蛾，去了哥哥，棄了哥哥
。把頭相向淚懸河，怎舍哥哥，漫舍哥哥。此歸花案不差訛，生屬哥哥，死屬哥哥。
　　世隆調《望江南》云：
　　堪愁處，風急力難支。司馬只驚消渴死，文君謾唱別離詞。愁淚遍胭脂。----
扶頭起，祝付莫相疑。於　寧無相會日，張儀還有可言時，欲去仍躊躕。
　　瑞蘭樂府云：
　　淚潺潺，愁破肝。別君易兮見君難。見君何處是，除在夢魂間。嗚乎命薄兮瑞
蘭！
　　世隆樂府云：
　　雲白兮山青，篪響兮人行。雲雨山兮還相見，我與卿兮從此分程。卿卿兮，未
知何日見卿卿。
　　瑞蘭至水站，尚書用蘇合丸療蘇。
　　世隆病牀間，得思古家老少扶持。又鎮有豪士仇萬頃、楊邦才等數人，重其斯文
，常交互相慰。又有陳自文者，素以風情諭世隆，曰：「以子之才，承事趙孟，必得近幸
，豈專為彼一人哉？」世隆曰：「佳人難再得，況遇知己之至耶！」自文曰：「婦人
太美者必有大惡，賀太后以女人能悟之，況足下豪傑男子耶？」世隆曰：「如先生所言，
則以世隆為季益矣。其如崔小士何！」自文曰：「君以花為癖矣，希再保重，焉知玉簫
不再合耶？」世隆曰：「但看將來有崑崙奴耳。否則王宮又梵矣。」自文輩歸，世隆為夜
坐不寐者，一夜口占詩詞甚多，聊記其可採者，以見新別之愁態云。
　　世隆詩云：
　　昨夜牀中婦對夫，牀中今夜獨夫孤。
　　羨魚不懈空張網，失兔為因誤寧株。
　　念我有心逢得意，笑伊無眼識相如。
　　於今病骨增愁恨，一曲西風子夜啼。
　　又云：
　　昨夜牀中萬斛情，牀中今夜萬愁生。
　　為誰陷入顛狂夜，被鬼迷來惑溺坑。
　　我亦忍遭胯下辱，伊終難拔眼前釘。
　　於今獨坐瀟瀟悶，一曲相思夜五更。
　　尚書至臨安，夫人已先至官邸數月矣。相見間，悲喜交集，一家愛戀，皆輻輳庭間。
瑞蘭見夫人，哀不自勝。有頃，夫人以瑞蓮事語尚書，呼出見間，一如家人禮。瑞蘭私以
世隆事白母，夫人亦乘間語及，尚書曰：「我豈老耄者哉？使有封倫，我亦能揚公壽矣。」
夫人曰：「賈香偷韓壽，奈何？」尚書曰：「張賀家五嫁者，猶為宰相妻也，無妨。」
夫人曰：聞世隆有司馬一題地，尚書何吝卓王孫？況瑞蘭嘗曰：『父不姚雄，我當封發矣。』」
尚書曰：「決不以隋珠彈雀也。此後勿復陳。」　
　　夫人覘尚書意篤，日又求婚者甚毛，亦令易志。瑞蘭不允，每以稿砧在辭。因思瀟
湘舊跡，乃以一亭改匾曰《拜月》，祈以誓心香而存世隆也。嘗有拜月詩詠甚多，聊記一
二，以表瑞蘭冰霜之守云。
　　瑞蘭詩曰：
　　亭前拜月夜黃昏，暗想當年欲斷魂。
　　婁敬不來幾十載，肖娘自負萬千春。
　　伊如有分應逢我，我亦何心再望人。
　　自古玉英終不嫁，幾曾誤作百年身。
　　又云：
　　亭前獨拜淚汪汪，說到心頭隻身傷。
　　念我一家都美顏，為誰千里獨淒涼。
　　畫眉風月今何在，結髮江山事已荒。
　　問道雲間歸北雁，無雙消息寄何鄉？　　
　　時當首歲，仇萬頃輩詣世隆，效文琰擊缽。世隆曰：「諸兄才捷不讓古十石矣，
生何敢復夢得自待？」萬頃曰：「生雖千錢售三十文，不待磨墨停筆。但今海內士與元
白爭鋒者，唯卿一人而已。何辭為？」世隆曰：「詩因名美，名因詩顯，愧生二者俱未。
」萬頃曰：「何以言之？」世隆曰：「晉張率作詩，李納每以為不足，率後詐作沈約制，
則納字字稱佳。信詩不因名而顯乎？近有龍太初，詩學高邁，詣王荊公談詩，郭公父猶
謂之，及詠『鳥去風平篆，朝來日射星』之句，王、郭始不敢謂秦無人，龍生因以顯名
天下。」萬頃曰：「不但張率受侮，文士皆相輕。王荊公詠菊，且有以『不似春花落」鄙
之者。蘇東坡久府，亦有以制詞如詩鄙之者。詩果以名顯乎否也？蔡確因甑山詩被貶，孟
浩然以『不才明主棄』一句見惡，至於『楓落吳江冷』，又為吳　累。詩其能至患害者有之
，況於名乎！」世隆曰：「王、蔡公，今人亦能知之，則亦以名顯也。」萬頃曰：「兄此議
論，尤出人意表。」因對五辛，醉詠而別。世隆思瑞蘭意篤，制《送愁文》並詩詠，具錄
於此。
　　送愁文云：
　　八年除夕，蔣氏子館予於瀟湘。五辛宴罷，落落皇皇，無以為懷，客語予曰
：『良辰不再，子獨怏然，無乃為愁鬼所絆乎？』予曰：『愁，信有鬼乎？』客曰：
『有之。妖不自作，由人而興。三思重色而花妖至，崇韜喜淫而虎祟生。古人自寡
其妖者亦多。』予曰：『如此奇妖，計將安去？』客曰：『禳之而已。昔子產息良消
之怪，堯佐祭游弈之神，至誠所鍾，自足以歆之。』予信客言，遂束芻靈，祭諸門
外，慇懃至懇，蓋將草雉禽拿，人其人而去之也。禳畢，閉門就席，愁鬼忽又在左右
間，令予心碎，令予腸斷，令予淚傾，令予魂消，令予如有求而弗得。予始愕然歎曰
：『客其欺我者也！愁鬼可禳，何其我愁之尚在耶？』鬼曰；『君不必咎客也，但當自
咎耳。鬼有曰風流，曰愁悶，二者常相表裡，不可遽逐。』予傾聽之，矍矍方驚，鳴
竹爆，出桃符，焚紫盆，鬼笑自如；又將起，將趙鍾茶壘而啖之，鬼笑愈加。予始曰
：『鬼何笑我為哉？』鬼徐徐而言曰：『風流之鬼，唯恐其不來；愁怨之鬼，人恐其不
去。幽於偏見，罔達於相倚之機，此其為我笑也。』予聞言有趣，拱手而問曰：『愚不
能進，願安承教。』鬼曰：『居，吾語汝。天下古今，憂喜同根，福兮禍所伏，老子之
言，樂極必成哀，陶妻識之。子既戀於風流，則風流之中便有愁。兩鬼相依，步不容
離，世豈有風流而不愁者哉！君今特欲去我，而不知風流之鬼所當先。是猶日行怕影，
影愈隨。孰若先風而去，以為投陰滅影計耶？否則，雖效韓公之祭五窮，柳子之罵三屍
，亦無益於事矣。予捫心而思曰，風浪者，吾終身之裘葛膏粱也，豈能去哉？況我二人
不但入子之心，且入子之膏肓也，更迭相尋，何有終期？』言訖，倏然草蒿，如風如雨
，鬼則飄然而不可知，特剩其愁以遺予。予不得已，就燈對酒，為消此愁，成千萬分中
之一二。
　　柳梢青調云：
　　楚岐雲收，西廂月暗，竹瀑飛聲，玉友歸程羅衾淚滴，繡枕魂驚花中永中膏肓，
起來對坐誰適情？半盞孤燈，幾杯濃酒，一柳梢青。
　　又詩曰：
　　玉人別後阻關山，心碎黃昏獨倚欄。
　　柏柿曾看鞭橘荔，杉羊反悟寶　鞍。
　　油乾盞裡心還在，炭熱爐中骨自寒。
　　何日神仙偏愛我，紅消春色出熬垣。
　　又云：
　　病損公然骨似柴，飛瓊分薄阻雲階。
　　色攤門外驅猶在，愁鬼心頭去復來。
　　一盞梅花空見色，兩盤燭淚自成堆。
　　何時借起神磨勒，深院薔薇趕夜開。
　　一日，瑞蘭、瑞蓮相攜游亭，瑞蘭心切世隆，神思恍如有失，言語問答，多不自
持。瑞蓮疑其私，辭歸，蘭許之。蓮匿於太湖石後，覘其來者何人。久之無蹤。但見
瑞蘭長噫灑淚曰：「天曰君而已。」蓮往訊其實，蘭怒曰：「我身即汝，敢相誣耶？」
瑞蓮以歡言謝，乃辭歸，匿於前所。瑞蘭意瑞蓮之果於歸。蘭焚香祝天「保佑蔣生出
」。未幾，刺背曰：「蓮得聞矣。同室兄弟，何相瞞之甚耶？言通無患。」瑞蘭泣而不
言。良久，誦一詞以答。聊記於此。
　　詞曰：
　　妹氏何如致我，我有許多不可。憶昔舊情人，淚沾巾。望斷瀟湘，那裡病損
相如痊未？要說許闌珊口難開。
　　瑞蘭語及蔣生世隆，中都路人，瑞蓮亦泣下。瑞蘭疑其前人，駭愕者久之。
核實，乃兄妹。因道病別時事，相對涕泣。有頃，尚書召瑞蘭曰：「來使雲瀟湘人
亡矣。子當從婚。」蓋尚書立計，間其易志也。瑞蘭號泣仆地。瑞蓮聞之亦然。
尚書夫人方知其為瑞蓮兄。數日間，瑞蘭穿素，朝夕私奠，遣僕僮永安持牲文祭
於黃公家。至，則世隆在坐，與友人陳自文聯笑。永安具以情告。世隆執文讀之，
笑曰：「一死一生，乃見真情。世隆死者復生，娘子生不愧死矣。美節成雙，不可及
也。」瑞蘭方知尚書作良平計也。但其祭文貞心義氣，秋霜烈日，世隆友人多瞻視
之。
　　祭文云：
　　維某年某月某日，棄人瑞蘭黃氏，謹以牲醴，哀奠於義夫蔣生世隆之靈曰：
「嗚呼傷哉！妾別君時，自以死生君矣。所以不死者，亦為君一塊肉在耳，詎意
君先棄妾耶！妾遭草昧，荷君更生，心固不讓於鍾建之負季羋，力尤不忝於元稹
之負崔鶯。殆將一生永賴，百歲偕歡，孟光之案可以舉，桓公之車可以挽，袁蘆
之妝台可以下。昊天不弔，豎鳥為妖，日月居諸，彩鸞分道，固吾父之見疏賈老
，亦吾君之分薄韓郎。但血誓之未堅，而心香之猶在。玉簫再合，特托諸天；金
鏡重完，委之乎命。白璧不須於來客，紅繩終結於老人。詎又變生分外，報入幃
中，歡聲未續而哀聲之輒舉，暫別已難而永別之何當。意者將主長白而起有妝歟
？將室瑤芳而堂番雨歟？抑將襲淵商而修文泉府歟？胡為還造化之速，一至於是
耶？嗚呼天兮！云胡不靈！妾生有此，不如無生。傷君者妾，傷妾者誰？傷妾所
以傷君，傷君亦以傷妾。一則傷君之春秋方盛，一則傷妾之身事何依；一則傷君
之文翰未酬，一則傷妾之良偶空期；一則傷君之旅魂飄飄，一則傷妾之軀命亦無
幾。更有可傷者，尤在於我君蓋棺之時，口難禁而目不瞑，身雖寒而心尚在，魄
雖散而冤魂猶未消。況唳鶴啼猿，付諸行客；村醪野飯，孰為主人？僕雁凶魚，
偶托奚童而到我焉耳。東方杳矣，夢萆何求？麻姑逝矣，魂香何收？趙十四君已矣
，血淚傳衣之悃，何以綢繆？愁城堅鎖，悶海難消；束芻人遺，揚粉天遙。君其有
知乎？則妾身猶有所伸；君其無知乎？則安心止於自憐。但英雄精氣通於山嶽，豪
烈神光貫乎雲霄。觀之鄭良止之作厲，楊子文之作福，桑維翰之作仇，可覘君其必
有知也已。君兮有知，則斷臂之貞心，割鼻之義膽，墜樓赴水之方骸烈骨，妾敢自
恃，而君亦可自慰於九泉之下矣。灑淚拜辭，濡雞示曲。倘洋洋如在於艾蒿之餘，
勿吝生前之我愛者於我乎一歆。嗚呼！天兮人也，奈何！奈何！
　　時宋設文武科，羅網異才，興福詣瀟湘，邀世隆俱往臨安。世隆途想瑞蘭，弗
勝愁悶。興福覘其意，多方安慰，嘗曰：「弟至京師，願為押衙。」世隆曰：「非章
台其人也。」興福曰：「彼自延賞耳，兄何不韋臯自待？」世隆亦稍弭，住寓臨安
東南街。
　　值花朝，士多花會，世隆乃寫一軸蘭，上有青龍棲而不得之狀，標額曰「龍會
蘭池圖」，仍題一小引云：「龍襟四海衽五湖，車駕八方雲南顧，乃欲棲蘭焉，何哉？
或以蘭有似於神潭五花歟？亦有似於天台紅葉歟？胡為欲棲之如是耶？予嘗觀之《易
》矣，乾係龍，同人釋以蘭。夫同人乾居上，離居下，獨以蘭顯而不及於龍焉，蓋亦
離為之累耳。然龍者天下之靈物也，其世隱；蘭者天下之瑞物也，其世顯。惟其隱，
故隱，故能人於蘭之瑞；惟其顯，故能藏於龍之神。龍會蘭池，信取諸此而已。嗚呼
蘭兮，龍病久矣，時無孫真人，誰與謀！」圖成，令人鬻諸尚書家人永安，倩人置諸
蘭軒右。偶值瑞蘭散游一玩，讀至小引「人蘭之瑞」「藏龍之神」，乃知世隆手段，及
至「蘭兮龍病」處，噫嗟良久，曰：「龍兮來矣。」乃延乳母張氏入，示以情素，給金
數顆，贖浣火衣，仍附書一章。
　　瑞蘭書曰：
　　奉觀圖引，玉琢金雕，有天然之巧；神態仙模，無塵俗之累，非天下大英雄不能
及此。寅惟瀟湘別後，暮鼓夜鐘，暗增懷抱；霜天曉月，徒起相思。一日三秋，廢詩
於座右；千回萬轉，駭元集乎龕間。加以加多孫秀，每慕綠珠之美；人似敏中，尤圖
柴氏之婚。月道東西，孟氏嗟陳郎而未還；花牆內處，秀英慨文舉以何歸。愁妖悶鬼
，後先牽絆；別經離凶，日夜夾攻。心思紛紛，未知死所也。但封發之心，一生莫改
；露筋之節，至死猶堅。齊瑟雖工，謾變好竿之想；曾珠最曲，惟儲巧線之來。既而蜀
關天險，假金牛以通路；烏國海遙，從社燕以歸軒。事關美吻，可卜玉簫之再合；意氣投
歡，停看鸞鳳之雙飛。伏願移花月案於度外，濟風雲事於眼前。鯤離海嶠，遠接呂臻之風
；鵬入天池，近載仁祖之恩。則古之盧詣，安得專美；今之薛氏，亦敢有芳矣。匆匆寄意
，賜宥為情；東風多厲，千萬自珍。勿以妾為深念，不勝仰至。
　　張氏至世隆客寓，先以求浣火衣為詞，世隆曰：「鄭服不衷，為身之災。寒儒懸鶉
者也，焉有此？」張氏以「出自小姐」為言，世隆詐曰：「秦白狐裘，狗盜矣。」張氏
曰：「君勿猶豫，妾乃是小姐命使也。」乃示以金。世隆曰：「中流失楫，一瓠千金，娘
子去矣，賴此為鏡中人，何金贖為？」張氏曰：「媼乃娘子之私人，娘子乃君之私人，人不
同而私同。君若懷異，則水母無蝦，終身不獲詞以私矣。」世隆理其詞，出衣授之。張氏乃
以書獻。世隆玩之，喜躍欲狂，乃制書一章並詩二律，付之以歸。
　　世隆書曰：
　　寅惟娘子瓊枝瑤葉，名重於九棘三槐；國色天姿，驕出乎十洲三島。假使狼煙不
起，南北慶豐亨之盛；鳥道無虞，官氏安豫大之休；則娘子虎豹開岩，鬼神莫得瞰其
狀；鱗鴻路絕，奸雄安得進其私？昊天不弔，邊防為之失守；日月居諸，士女以之逭生
。醜人世隆，塵緣有在，千里相逢於道左；國步多艱，一旬方穩於杭中。杯酒論私，幾至
楚弓之失；春詞告絕，方成趙璧之歸。鳳舞鸞顛，恍若從天而下；花盟月誓，端然非人所
能。詎意金橘多酸，夙起曹郎之恨；野禽唱禍，迭來韓虎之凶。無可奈何，花已落去，曾
似相識，燕不來歸。一日三秋，益重相如之病；寸心萬里，徒增荀燦之愁。與其失諸於今
，孰若無得於前；與其易於別，孰若難於遇！世隆念此，淹然無復人間意。但飄瓠約在，
終結神州之會；蠶女心存，竟完桑府之恩。柳毅義人，龍女之婚不改；鍾郎負我，羊娘之
存猶在。倘樂昌之鏡終破，而元稹之詩亦空題矣，則亦命也，數也，卿之薄也。天兮人兮
，龍其奈何！茲者驛使既通，而赤繩之結可偶，涸魚在轍，而江水之恩何遲。伏願藍橋夜
月，適載裴航之遇；巫峽明雲，速承神女之歡。桃源麻飯，華岳玉釵，瑤台之曉露，早與
神仙共脫塵累。無任霓看聿仰之至。
　　詩曰：
　　瀟湘店裡鳳雙飛，天造妖風翼已垂。
　　一片芳心千片碎，十分花債九分移。
　　夢中豈悟身為客，醉後還將月想伊。
　　星友今朝通露閣，玉人謾唱誤佳期。
　　又詩：
　　一道盤桓戀子都，誰知病裡散葫蘆；
　　卿家富貴今如舊，我處風流絕已無。
　　蔡仲何曾戕女婿，雍姬自誤好兒夫；
　　今朝欲整瀟湘案，案上爭能認故吾？　　
　　張氏攜衣書而來，瑞蘭喜曰：「合浦珠至矣。」及啟書視，笑語張氏曰：「顧其人，非
微之矣。但西廂之月，未可待於今日。」張氏曰：「男子用情，惟欲敢足於一己之私，奚暇
他顧？」瑞蘭曰：「蔣君曾不念此一時也，彼一時也。彼一時前無牛裂，後無輿曳，聽其自
便。今日相公法峻，閣宇蜀難，不惟彼無所入，我亦將無所出，雖鬼兵萬千，何所施其術耶
？」張氏曰：「將何詞以釋之？」瑞蘭曰：「汝以慕客寓，列人李吉者告之云：今日豈為飲食來
耶？況京畿夜禁，誰敢來往？勿故為撲燈蛾，幸甚！」乃回詩二律，雲次韻。
　　瑞蘭次韻云：
　　憶別瀟湘馬似飛，傷心千里淚長垂。
　　情深東海終難盡，判定南山永不移。
　　司馬此生專為我，文君雖死也從伊。
　　不須再導風花案，一線紅絲百歲期。
　　又云：
　　犬戎當日鬧燕都，萬里江山破荻蘆。
　　花月竊盟天下有，風流獨步世間無。
　　張生只恐忘崔氏，秦後何甘離醜夫。
　　要把瀟湘前案整，夜深怕殺執金吾。
　　世隆時將文戰，見瑞蘭詩來，亦允其說。揭曉，世隆文魁天下，堂吏報尚書，時適瑞
蘭偕夫人在坐，瑞蘭喜躍，白夫人曰：「正瀟湘其人：「夫人喜謂尚書曰：「公何不識盧肇
耶？」尚書笑曰：「塵埃中若識天宰相，則人皆物色之矣。」夫人因祝尚書擬婚，尚書許
之。瑞蘭隨具柬，並詩來賀焉。
　　詩曰：
　　渤海從來不可量，英雄事業破天荒。
　　當年曾受風塵苦，今旦方依日月光。
　　五色雲中驚太史，六龍駕上聳天王。
　　從茲慰卻鼇頭夢，鸞鳳妝台可奪芳。
　　世隆受冰贈鞭，仍見瑞蘭賀柬，笑曰：「今日親，則前日親，謹領。」乃行大禮。
其婚書則同年友、榜眼仇萬頃所制。萬頃細知二人情曲，蓋將針尚書而劑天下後世之
渺寒士者，其書假世隆叔祖一春主婚，畫六十四卦組織云：
　　蓋聞《易》係家人，重兩姓合歡之好；《詩》稱桃實，垂百年偕老之期。以至《書
》傳媯造，《禮》存坊記，《春秋》逆女之筆，無非為婚媾者立指南。但謀肇於人，緣定
於天，睹諸朱氏之箜篌，韋郎之翠鈿，李姓之履信坊，富家貴家不能奪貧，子弟之三十九
色者可知。寅惟尊府，槐棘嗑芳，江南草木知名；華夷布節，海外鷹熊仰視。正區區小頑
，肥遁邊方，自履之地，並邊內郡，幸蒙豫大之天，謙居恐墜，蠱壞益深。矧小姪世隆，
鉛槧自頤，慨時升而未允；草茅方困，念睹光以何能。第以乾坤否剝，師旅震臨，艮山兑
澤，偶奏合和之曲；離火坎泉，妙傳既濟之歡。加以令小姐巽德攸恒，真南國之蘋蘩，豐
才素畜，冠謝家之柳絮。自謂同人永相伉儷，詎期大有輒出妄災。過飛鳥而睽孤之豕以見
，失包魚而歸妹之羊攸存。第托大緣俱損，而雷涣之劍徒解；國是鼎元，而楚和之璧隨來
。簪纓宦族，既稱孚萃之異；襁褓野人，亦羨復需之奇。人情如此，信猶賢於夢卜也。茲
申齎帛，特表訟德之舊，載薦損期，停看革文之新。伏願桃夭詠唱，而宜家宜室之作范；
檑子協聞，而衍子衍孫之呈祥。至九十其儀，百兩其御，俗之富，何足贅。辰下涣風串柳
，晉日篩梅，萬希台重，上薦天申，不悉。
　　尚書受禮，一覽婚書，懷諸袖中，恚曰：「呼牛呼馬，亦應之矣。」後知萬頃所制，心
甚銜之。時擇四月望日夜行贅禮，燈月交輝，清天一色，金紫送迎，沉檀薰馥。世隆環　
玎鳴，冠簪煌映，人望之如神仙然。平生索婚不獲者，今乃知其天才國色，成定難移，古
往今來，佳期罕偶，甘心貼服，莫敢云何也。
　　世隆入，瑞蘭泣曰：「不意今日復見漢官威儀。」頃之，侍婢數十，珠翠鮮明，進席奉
醪，添香樹燈。瑞蘭官樣整汝，仙姿增豔，宛然神仙之下降也，世隆合巹，幾不能自持。
瑞蘭悟，命侍婢散。世隆曰：「卿真豪傑也。」瑞蘭曰：妾不豪傑，兄將亡賴矣。」乃就幃
敘舊，情悃甚周。時有聯名，聊記於此。
　　聯云：
　　新人本是舊情人（世），丹桂嫦娥喜絕倫（瑞）。
　　淮下誰能知韓信（世），洛陽今已識蘇秦（瑞）。
　　英雄手段真無賽（世），仙子光容自有真（瑞）。
　　笑我初婚身是假（世），憐伊與逸骨將魂（瑞）。
　　寸心千里塵都掃（世），半刻千金案又存（瑞）。
　　愛虎與茲登虎穴（世），得魚從肯下魚綸（瑞）。
　　萬般富貴天然處（世），一種風流分外恩（瑞）。
　　深院花心人帶雨（世），洞房物色盡逢春（瑞）。
　　破蓮分肉根猶在（世），食蔗到頭味更真（瑞）。
　　酒後添杯休強醉（世），茅前效尤易成（瑞）。
　　晉兵鏖戰雄難敵（世），問客縱橫計莫陳（瑞）。
　　無可奈何田旱久（世），還曾相識燕樓頻（瑞）。
　　芙蓉帳裡疑為夢（世），翡翠衾中妙入神（瑞）。
　　大盜曾聞驚惠子（世），雞嗚方喜脫田君（瑞）。
　　不須人作同心結（世），仍是天生連理身（瑞）。
　　從此風流終百歲（世），相憐相愛更相親（瑞）。
　　夜燈，瑞蘭曰：「兄今見妾，樂乎？」世隆曰：「何待言！」瑞蘭曰：「尤有甚於見妾
者。」世隆曰：「樂盡於此矣，無他也。」瑞蘭曰：「瑞蓮在妾家。」且告以其詳。世隆
喜躍不勝，欲召見，瑞蘭沮之曰：「蜘蛛作道，不可以風。兄忘其傷於虎乎？」　次曉，
瑞蘭邀瑞蓮入見，兄妹相逢，宛若夢中，信是天啟其衷，而為不世之奇逢也。有頃，出
拜尚書夫人於堂上。一家慶會傳都城，翰墨士大夫詩賀甚多，不在行錄。其妹瑞蓮，後
乃命配友人同年探花賈士恩。
　　世隆嘗有《風花》一作，聊記於此：
　　蔣生世隆謂玉人瑞蘭曰：「予今二人魚水相歡矣，同事風花，則有文房四子，曰筆、
曰墨、曰紙、曰硯而已。不假以恩，寧無沙中偶語乎？」瑞蘭曰：「俞。」及拜筆曰拜花
郎，墨曰磨花伯，硯曰合花子，紙曰通花太使。四子拜封，將之任，筆不悅，曰：「予制
自皇帝，管於蒙恬，爵於韓文公，今乃拜郎，次於三子之下，寧不為文房之王乎？」詰諸
墨曰：「子何功？居吾上？」墨曰：「韓文公，唐臣也。玄宗，唐君也。子雖重於韓，其視
我化道士、步天宮而重於唐君者孰高？」筆不敢與爭。又潔諸硯曰：「汝端溪居士以壽靜稱，
乃亦侈然居吾上乎？」硯笑曰：「予即墨侯耳。管城子，列爵唯五也。侯與子，孰先？」筆由
是語塞。乃詰諸紙曰：「子何人也，亦欲右吾乎？」紙曰：「予生於蔡，制於薛，莊重於五鳳
樓韓家，任乎治，則泣山東之父老；任乎檄，則起枋頭之奸雄。爾固不敢與墨爭，而敢當我
乎？」筆笑曰：「子亦欲方諸墨硯耶？子非我，則空函所以羞殷浩；我誤子，則露布所以羞蘇緘
。子當下我必矣。」紙大笑曰：「子非我則鐵書銀鉤何所施？描花模月將付諸誰？」爭辯不已。
硯釋之曰：「要皆風花中人也，何苦爭高？所可慨者，洞房六子耳。曰牀、曰帳、曰褥、曰衾、
曰氈、曰枕，空預風花之列，而不受風花之蔭，行將為介子推矣！」筆、紙曰：「信其傷哉！」
乃相率而白諸蔣生案下。蔣生曰：「非諸子為言，予亦長頸鳥喙矣。」乃拜戛玉牀曰迎花力士，
拜翡翠衾曰護花元帥，拜遊仙枕曰轉花將軍，拜芙蓉褥曰和花虞侯，拜五花氈曰帖花招討，拜
獅子帳曰統花都尉。六子受封，乃與四子分班受命。頃之，護花元帥曰：「諸將受封矣，誰其主
之？」統花都尉曰：「諸將無主，願蔣生為主。」洞房諸子　言曰：「吁，蔣生其封花主也。」文
房四子曰：「何偏也？蔣生主風，娘子主花可也。」洞房六子曰：「主花者無風，主風者無花，如
此兩子亦無樂乎其為主矣。」四子曰：「兩子無以為樂，以其所有，易其所無，天下之樂，孰加於
是？今日都共成兩主之歡，復何言！」
　　一日，瑞蘭攜世隆游後園，見亭匾曰「拜月」，沉思久之，笑曰：「子其念瀟湘舊跡
乎？」瑞蘭曰：「然。」世隆曰：「生觀今日，則娘子之終身可知矣。」遂制《拜月亭記
》以表瀟湘之遺蹟。其記云：
　　古人名亭，所以示不忘也。歐陽不忘山水，名以豐樂；希文不忘清素，名以濯纓焉
，忠肅不忘榮歸，名以衣錦；瀟湘主人以瀟湘之亭名於臨安官舍，其亦有所不忘者矣，
亭有月，月有人，設榻一張，焚香一炷，拜於玲瓏之間，其不忘者，情耳，情之所在，
時則隨之。時乎束芻人遺，鴻鯉天遙，參商地阻；其拜也，滿地蟲聲，過牆花影，心傷
千里，淚灑盈襟，人愁也，月愁也，亭固愁亭也，愁其不忘也已，時乎繩囊永固，鸞鳳
交飛，汝台並游；其拜也，蘭麝薰芳，絲羅映色，一唱一隨，一歌一舞。人樂也，月樂
也，亭固樂亭也，樂其不忘也已。憂樂不同，而同於不忘，情至是，其亦鍾矣。予嘗以
是問諸亭，亭則無知；問諸月，月則無言；問諸心，心則無征，進而問之友人，友人付
之一笑耳。三致問，始言曰：「月與天地久者也，爾我之情，其月之於天地乎？寧容忘？
」予曰：「情不忘矣。」記之。
　　附風、花、雪、月四詞於左：
　　風裊裊，風裊裊。冬嶺泣孤松，春郊搖弱草。收雲月色明，卷霧天光早。清秋暗送
桂香來。拯夏頻將炎氣掃。風裊裊，野花亂落令人老。
　　花豔豔，花豔豔。妖嬈巧似汝，鎖碎渾如剪。露凝色更鮮，風送香常遠。一枝獨茂
逞冰肌，萬朵爭妍含醉臉。花豔豔，上林富貴真堪羨。
　　雪飄飄，雪飄飄。翠主封梅萼，青鹽壓竹梢。灑空飛絮浪，積檻聳銀橋。千山渾駭
鋪鉛粉，萬木依稀掛素袍。雪飄飄，長途游子恨迢遙。
　　月娟娟，月娟娟。乍缺鉤橫野，方圓鏡掛天。斜移花影亂，低映水紋連，詩人舉盞
搜佳句，美女推窗遲夜眠。月娟娟，清光千古照無邊。
第二卷    
　　劉生覓蓮記（上）
　　劉一春，字茂華，號熙寰，江東人也。世居重疊山華村之西，為故家舊族，祖先廣
積陰功。父武南公，為癢生，有重名，厚於德，福於學，而未發，嘗自信曰：「吾有兒必
顯。」生三子：一奉，一春，一泰。一春自幼聰穎，稟逸韻於天陶，含衝氣於特秀。甫
十五，即留心武事，弓馬精熟，以鷹揚自期；忽思「挽二石弓，不如識一丁字」，遂棄武
，專於文。年十八，補邑庠生，獵史搜經，著述日富，遠蜚清譽，卓冠士林。人以其才似
賈誼，稱為「洛陽子」。
　　時有母舅馬二臯，知府鄰省。生極為舅妗所鍾愛，生父命生餞送。舅欲與之偕，生以
秋試在念，送二程而返。過一鳳巢谷，有老人稱知微翁，數術甚高，戢曜幽壑，彩真重崖
，僻結草廬於山麓。生亦仰其名，特拜求今歲之數。老人先書一紅紙貼於門曰：「今日主喜
事福人至。」生至懇數，書二句付生，曰：「覓蓮得新藕，折桂獲靈苗。」生不解，求明示
。老人又畫一人手持一圭，下書「己酉禾斗」字。生曰：「吾當於己酉發科乎？然非其時矣
。」老人笑曰：「數之說微，徵則為驗，但前行，知此不過三日。」生辭退。
　　次日，至一村。綠水護居，竹籬遮舍，其家姓趙名思智，號樂水散人，蓋生之受業恩師
也。因進訪，師喜，款留備至，寓生於東廂之梅軒前。時屬孟春末旬，寒玉堆芳，冰葩散馥
。生步於梅下，誦古詩一首：
　　玉堂清不寐，寒夜漏聲長。吟到梅花處，詩成字也香。
　　復舉手整冠，仰數梅花。見古梅壓短牆東西，聞隔牆似有女聲者，乃以折梅為由，履
扁石窺之。一女淺妝淡飾，年可十六七，手執梅枝，口中吟曰：「今日看梅樹，新花已自生
。」忽回頭見生，遽掩其身。生心贊曰：「冰肌玉質，不亞壽陽，笑出花間語，獨擅百花之
魁。不意塵埃中有此仙品！」俄而師至，與生游於適然園。至紅甫亭，亭中有桃花紙掛屏
，針剌小詩一絕：
　　小園日涉已成趣，引得東風到草堂。惟有芳桃解春意，笑舒粉臉待劉郎。
　　生玩之，似有喜意。師笑曰：「此吾甥女所書，自幼愛觀史籍並詞話，獨處皆喜題
詩。渠父不知戒，吾以謂非女子長技，往往規之。昨與寒荊到小園，又有此絕句矣。
昔吾姊夢李白送軸而生，蓋不凡女也。」生極心慕口贊，返至樹下，獨立久之，自思
：「題詩之女，必隔牆所見者。」忽憶知微翁之數，點首悟曰：「人持一圭，乃『佳』
字也；己酉二字，乃『配』字也。所謂佳配者，其此乎？不然，何以曰『解春意』？又
曰：『待劉郎』？又不然，何不先不後而見詩睹面，適當三日之期也？微生有幸，當不避
赴梅之嫌；淑女多緣，幸尚免標梅之歎。吩咐梅花自主張，為我作媒妁，如何？」　
　　次日又至，隔牆自沉吟曰：「今朝梅樹下，定有詠花人。」用意窺之，則杳不可見。
欲久留以圖再面，自度不可。辭師而歸，悒悒曰：「此別一見無由，何有於配？知微翁、
知微翁，其戲我矣！」　
　　越日，稟命父母，攜琴負芨，遊學外處。泛舟至落石村，推篷望之：柳拖新綠，桃
染初紅。乃停舟水涯，步於堤上，吟曰：
　　弱柳含顰弄楚腰，孤舟趁日渡低橋。
　　閒花有意迎征袖，回首黃鸝過別梢。
　　時有一老者，鬚髮皓然，衣冠閒雅，一舟一僕，飄然而來。適與生值，見生年少
可挹，知其非常人，因詢生所以。生語之故。老人張目視生曰：「華村劉二郎，其執事
否？」生曰「然。」老人喜甚，蓋生之父與老人素契者。老人姓金，名維賢，號守樸
野老，年逾六旬，性好交納，而家極饒裕，且崇禮樂善，鄉譽頗隆。與生執手談曰：「
吾家歲延名師文士，為課兒計，又與尊翁契厚，其枉留文旌，以續通家舊好。」生欣
然從之。至家，館生於東堂左室。
　　時守樸翁有名園，奇花異卉，怪石叢林，種種咸具，人羨之曰「小洛陽」。而其中
有迎春軒。守樸翁逾數日，叩師以生所學，師大譽為名世器；而其子名友勝者，亦於
父前延譽不已。守樸翁加敬，遷生於迎春軒中。窗外有修竹數竿，竹外有花壇一座，
其側有二亭，一曰晴暉，一曰萬綠。亭畔有碧桃、紅杏數十株。轉南界一小粉牆，牆
啟一門，雖設而不閉者。牆之後，壘石為假山，構一堂，匾曰「閒閒」。旁有小樓，八
窗玲瓏，天光雲影，交納無礙。過荼架而西，有隔浦池。池之左，群木繁茂，中有茅亭
，匾曰「無暑」。池之右，有玉蘭數株，築一室曰「蘭室」。斜辟一逕，達於池之前，躍
魚破萍，鳴禽奏管，凡可玩之物，無不奪目愜情。盡園四圍環以高牆，凡至園者，必由
迎春軒後一門而入，扃其門則清閒僻靜，極樂世界也。守樸翁以絕人往來，故獨居生於
此。遣一俊僕，名守桂，承值以伴生，年十五，盡秀逸，且識字，善歌唱，性馴而雅。
生悅之，留於座側，教以詩曲，訓以書翰，即能領略，呼曰愛童。
　　生至壇前，配紅匹綠，胎青孕紫，芳逕閒閒，一塵不到，深以為幸。趁步徐行，見梅
枝橫覆牆上，歎曰：「風景不殊，梅下折花人何在？昔以三日為期，今數日不瞻矣。使此過
遇所見，假以時日，當不至空相憶也。」轉高西顧，池前一室，有小軒，遙見「培桂」二
字；波汶上檻，日縷搖窗，精熠殊甚。生意謂書室，逕由斜徑往窺之：珠簾高卷，絕無一
人；其中之所有，皆女工所需之物，雜以文几之具。恐有人覺而返。
　　次一日，洗硯於魚池，坐蘭室中，聞窗內有嘻笑聲。生悄步池側，忽見手持繡鞋
，可三寸許，置於簾外石上，僅露纖纖一手，吟曰：
　　「碧欄杆外苔痕濕，果是將來換繡鞋。
　　又一應聲曰：「今欲曬向西窗，趁晚晴乎？」生聞之，思：「幽僻處有些，其董
永之織女乎？其孫恪之袁氏乎？」未幾，又憑窗而吟曰：
　　芳心蕩漾，夜來愁擁梅花帳。風送清香，熏徹孤衾夢不成。
　　隔簷鶯鬧，為人鼓出相思調。體怯輕寒，連理羞將病眼看。」　
　　（《減字木蘭花》）　　
　　長吁一聲，初不知有生之在其側，探首簾外，生亦突抵簾前。兩面忽一相覿，
其女低聲曰：「簾外一生，美如冠玉，非天台路何以至此？」命侍女取繡鞋而入。生
初見之，月眉星眼，露鬢雲鬟，撇下一天丰韻；柳腰花面，櫻唇筍手，占來百媚芳
姿。盡態極妍，顏盛色茂，恍若玉環之再世，毛施之復容，其美難將口狀；而通詞
句，雅吟詠，又疑奇花而解語，真所謂仙宮只有世間無者也。生猛然自失曰：「此奇
貨可居也！乍遇間而自手及足、自面及心，總收一目，知微翁所云佳配，又果在此
乎？有女懷春，吉士誘之，吾今所寓，無異梅軒，使不至此，幾虛過一生矣。」久
立未忍遽去，意女已迴避，而不知端於簾內窺生。生佯為不見者，曰：「外面令人倍
惆悵，裡頭舉眼自分明矣。」因朗賦一詞，以作詞戰之先鋒云：
　　和光豔，春盈面，掀簾晴晝香風扇。人寂寂，愁如織。暖風倦體，看花無力。-
---雕樑畔，雙來燕，喃喃訴出愁多遍。傾城色，初相識，佳詞賦，也漏春消息。」
（《擷芳詞》）　　
　　生自思：「遊學每遇故知，已出非意，園名洛陽，軒曰迎春，若將有待予之至者
，況靜所遇文姬，與師處相見，才貌難伯仲。數日之間，二接才麗，益不易得，何
幸中之幸也！」乃書知微翁之數於壁間，憶女室而吟曰：
　　西鄰之女洵矣哉，入眼平生未有也；微生今日有何幸，不期而遇知音者。
　　又思：「女性幽靜，外言難入，而乃出口成章如是，深喜其可以筆句動也。」
作《如夢令》以自幸：
　　日暖風和時候，玉女花前邂逅。謾賦啟朱唇，輕遞脂香未透。欣驟，欣驟，
有日相如琴奏。
　　後女知此情為生所覺，心生愧赧，每玩景臨風，常定睛不語者移時。蓋聞生
之詞，接生之貌，愛生之才，若動隱情而口不可言耳。而生心亦未嘗一刻不在女
也。為雨阻，絕步園中。後值晴霽，輟卷縱觀。適守樸翁命愛童持羅衣授生，童
因尾生閒步。生指女室問之，童曰：「此吾鄰孫氏所居。其女名芳桃，改名碧蓮，
年已十八，詩賦詞歌、琴棋書畫、刺繡工夫，無不完備精絕。早喪其母，未曾許
配，故其父擇此居之。買一鄰女以伴蓮，姓曹，名桂紅，後改名素梅，少蓮娘二
歲，視如親妹，無一間言，諳文墨，美姿容，蓮娘之亞也。嘗於培桂軒中聯四景
詩，迭為酬和，以為得趣。嘗謂梅曰：『國朝若開女進士科，吾期奪傳臚首唱，亦
許爾共步瀛洲。』聞者每羨，而卒無能睹一面、得一詞者。其父性喜外出探友。
或竟日而返，或信宿而歸，歸則愛獨處一室而無親人。」生聞言，心神不勝踴躍
，囑童曰：「為我嚴鎖外門，吾今愛靜，無事則免使他人入來。」童會生之意，
唯唯笑曰：「吾固笑此門鎖鑰非童不可也。」生初聞其為芳桃，忽憶師處所見，
繼又聞其為碧蓮，猛省知微翁所云，於是念蓮之心更切矣。復題於壁曰：
　　直須杜門絕客，深下一團工夫；
　　定叫鐵杵成針，不負遠來夙志。
　　客至，見之，咸以生不喜交接，故候謁者亦稀。生亦自謂數有可乘，乃私號
「愛蓮子」，冀自遇於碧蓮，口占一詞，名曰《臨江仙》：
　　一睹嬌姿魂已散，滿腔心事誰知？東瞻西盼竟差遲。裝聾還作啞，似醉復如
癡。
　　我欲將心書尺素，倩人寄首新詩。個中暗與約佳期。不知何年更何月，何日
更何時。時有友李見陽拉生郊游。生與偕行。適數妓鬥草於得春亭下。詢之，皆
樂平巷中名妓，一曰李月英，一曰高巧雲，一曰包伊玉，一曰許文仙。生亦喜花
柳趣，心甚留愛，乃曰：「今日之行，觸眼見琳瑯珠玉，皆子美詩中黃四娘也。」同
興談笑移時。偕至印月溪邊，睹鴛鴦浴水，粉蝶穿花，因曰：「諸妹俱士女班頭，吾
欲擇其一，以締永好，先唱《憶秦娥》詞，能續成者即取之。」生徐曰：
　　春堤曲，一溪水漾新紋綠。鴦鴛弄日，晴沂對浴。
　　文仙執生之手，嘻嘻然應曰：
　　和風不斷香馥鬱，牆頭粉蝶相隨逐。相隨逐。雙雙飛入，花間並宿。（《憶秦娥》
）　　詞成，群口喝采。生敬且愛，期約而回。
　　坐窗下，花影橫欄，春香飄戶，有寂寥意。命童磨墨，拂箋揮一歌，使童歌之：
　　薄試輕羅散幽趣，鶯唇燕舌番新句。
　　東風引我入桃源，含笑桃花紅滿樹。
　　問花何事笑東風？笑我不飲空歸去。
　　我即解衣典醇酉錄，醉春買樂紅芳處。
　　只愁東風不久情，吹作一天輕紅絮。
　　著意看花花不紅，百計留春春不住。
　　春老花殘將奈何，袖薄難勝淚如注。
　　歌罷，同步於萬綠亭前。愛童揮小扇以逐飛蝶，生亦促之。忽二蝶爭花，墮花
下，相抱不解。生拆之，對童而笑。童笑曰：「物之性猶人之性，釋之、釋之，毋拆
散姻緣也。」生棄蝶，成《西江月》詞：
　　三月韶光過半，一年勝景堪奇。
　　傷春自個謾徘徊，偶睹游蜂墮地。
　　款款柔情莫托，殷殷吩咐蜂媒。
　　惟期及早效于飛，不負花前一對。
　　越夕，生囑愛童守門，逕訪妓家。文仙出《嬌紅記》，與生觀之。曰：「有是哉
！有始無終，非美談也。」留宿而回。
　　後日，守樸翁設宴，坐中紅袖，正前妓巧雲、文仙也。至晚，文仙自薦於生。
　　次日將別，守樸翁至，曰：「近來多冷落，文仙一名姝，欲留數日，以暢文興，
才子佳人，光我莊圃。」生歡甚，攜文仙劇飲於假山之小樓。時玉蘭開盛，又攜酌
於蘭室，問柳答花，搜聯構句，兩相暢逸，名珍情會。生曰：「卿名不在楚蓮香之
下，幸同枕席，誓不相忘。」文仙曰：「裡流澤藪，不足以辱君子。吾有一路指君
，君其圖之。」生問其故。文仙指蓮室曰：「個中一女，姿容絕世，美麗超群，賦性
聰明，詞華炳燁。吾有一友，竊窺之，羨曰：『美哉妙矣，諸好備矣，此誠無價寶也
。』聞惟一待女為伴，先結侍女之心，庶可漸入佳境。且以君之愷悌俊逸，無有求
而不得者。然須慎之密之，毋炫巧致拙。」生謝曰：「是教當書紳，是情當刻骨，此
言出在卿口，入在吾耳，幸毋他泄。」文仙曰：「君固不下申厚卿，我也不為丁憐憐，
亦何疑焉。」乃取一犀簪，解一香囊留贈而別。生視之，親繡一絕句：
　　獨坐紗窗理繡針，一絲一線費芳心。
　　從求知己親相贈，佩取慇懃愛我深。
　　生始感文仙愛己出於真誠，而情亦眷眷，不忍少忘。至午，素梅以生窗之左有海
棠花，偷步摘之。少愛童抱甕注水，適至澆花，戲謂梅曰：「吩咐偷花者：可一不可
再。」梅曰：「一之未甚，再思可矣。」童曰：「一摘使花好，再摘使花稀也。」因以
水濕其手，梅牽童衣拭之，反若有意於愛童者。童忙入謂生曰：「素梅在窗外，年雖少
，有丰韻，可挑也。」生故出，擁其歸路。梅摘花而返，生喜揖之，梅懷不安之狀。
生笑曰：　
　　「花下睹妖嬈，含羞稱萬福。相對兩難言，花豔驚郎目。」　
　　梅求路不得，曰：「先生當路於此，男女無以別於途。君子避女流，故不能少讓我
也？吾非迷失女子，胡為關津留難？」生曰：「為汝初犯竊盜，今欲盤詰奸細耳。」各
嘻然相視而笑。生憶文仙之言，心自計曰：「不將我語和他語，未卜他心知我心。」乃
戲問曰：「卿卿果芳桃之侍妹名桂紅者乎？抑果碧蓮之侍妹名素梅者乎？」梅曰：「先
生止游詩書之府，何由知閨閣之名也？」生紿曰：「吾昨夢登太華山，至西天闕，入廣
寒宮，履嫦娥殿，親得數名指示，故此積誠候卿。今得見之，正應佳夢矣。乞先為劉
一春道意，後有萬千未談之衷曲也。」梅曰：「此春夢也。吾非小紅，便逞張生家語，
吾當有一場發落！乍間姑免究。」執花而行，復回顧，低念「劉一春」者數四。生尾
其後，曰：「劉一春送。」梅戲應曰：「回！」生垂手頓足曰：「妙妙！女果以張生待我
，則雖訾栗斯、喔咿儒兒以事女，亦甘心也。」返室，愛童曰：「此女不速自來，焉得秋
毫無犯，作無事人乎？」生曰：「事勿欲速，恐耳屬於垣，則名教掃地也。且喋喋利口，
有無限風趣，此一物亦足以釋西伯矣。梅尚如此，蓮更何如。安排牙爪，以為降龍伏虎
之計，此第一著也。」童曰：「牽腸掛肚在蓮娘，送暖偷寒在素梅，詐謀奇計在相公，熱
心冷眼在小童。吾若守口如瓶，決不敗乃公事。好為之，好為之！」生暗喜曰：「成吾志
者，子也。今日喪心病狂亦由汝，賞心樂事亦由汝矣。」　
　　梅歸，對蓮備道生語，且有譽生意。蓮故作不理，偷書一歌於窗外：
　　鶯聲清曉傳春語，道說與遊人，趁我嬌華，莫放歌金縷。
　　杜鵑一夜叫聲喧，呼淒風，喚妒雨。促吾直往天涯去，要尋樂地誰為主？　
　　生至，味之，自覺蓮之留意甚速，喜焉如狂，曰：「且記此詞，為他日負賴表記。」
然時或見蓮，則見其故逞百媚之姿，或微露可疑之狀，或掩窗自蔽，或以目流情，或與
桂紅相謔，或正色不可動。假意真情，不可測識，而生亦未與蓮親接一語。且此有守桂
，彼有桂紅，亦未敢深信。故會面雖屢屢，心旆雖搖搖，而每為首鼠之狀。
　　一日，生抱悶，步於牆西之別圃，轉至假山，見碧蓮俏妝輕服，面帶喜容，纖手露
金鐲，捻並蒂花枝，視雙蝶鬥舞。蝶稍進，則隨而觀之。蝶漸近假山，生略少避，喜曰
：「蝴蝶甚著人。」蓮已見生，故作不見，反翻袖促蝶。生逼近，曰：「古有司花女，於今
見之，誠閨分之秀也。」乃整衣肅冠，施一長揖。蓮徐徐置花石上，含媚答禮，仍自執花
，偷目覷生。生以正目視蓮，各默默者久之。生笑曰：「幽花如處女。」蓮舉花視之，曰
：「此東坡閒話。」生指花枝低賦一絕曰：
　　卿手捻花枝，花敢與卿鬥。卿貌覺羞花，花應落卿後。
　　蓮曰：「君不怕花怪乎？」生曰：「然則卿愛我矣。」蓮面紅，曰：「先生大膽。」
舉扇自蔽，欲返。生前訴曰：「自見之後，未領笑語，企慕之悃，山高海深。每謂卿如
瓊林琪樹，常欲在目前，奈咫尺天涯，勞心怛怛。昨睹佳句，今尋得此樂地，願借假山
以為巫峰，縱委身風露，猶瞑目泉壤也。且楚詞有曰『樂莫樂兮新相知』，何太自鄭重如
此？」因執蓮之扇而牽之。蓮假手放扇於生，目生，低聲曰：「讀書人但輕自己之手足，更
不重他人之耳目耶？」生曰：「四無人聲，惟有子知我知耳。」蓮曰：「天知，地知，奈何？
」生曰：「天地無陰陽乎？」彷徨不能自持，遽執蓮手，曰：「到此地位，工夫尤難。此
未語可知心者。雖鐵石打成心性，亦當慈悲嗟愍！」斯時也，生魂已飛天外。蓮曰：「妾，
嬌體也，乃相煎太急，今日膽落於君矣！此臂今當斷君，亦何取於妾？且此何地也，此何
時也，此何事也，妾與君何如人也，而敢犯禮侵義若是也？」力欲脫身，墮下金鐲。生方
拾之，而素梅適至。
　　生避於樹下。梅曰：「料蓮娘被困，故獨馬單槍至此，可同我回。」蓮與俱返，體若
竦惕者，謂梅曰：「此生技癢，觸物便吟，豈其錦心繡口，故吐句皆若宿構耶？」梅笑而
不答。又曰：「此生貌欺潘岳，見之豈不欲投果？」梅又笑而不答。又曰：「此生出語溫
存，動容腼腆，必多情而重義者，今日反累彼懷抱矣。」梅又笑而不答。又曰：「此生遠
之則可愛近之則可畏，何也？」梅又笑而不答。蓮有慚色，欲行不行者久之。生尚兀立
不動，形如槁木，心如沸鼎，方歎曰：「天乎，天乎！救兵卒至，解圍白登，所謂對面不相
逢者乎！相見不相親，不如不相見。驚餌魚，傷弓鳥，何緣再得。」因作《行香子》詞，
書於蓮扇：
　　山石之旁，紅綠齊芳。遇佳娥，正出蘭房，嬌嬌媚媚，巧樣梳妝。更好風韻，好標緻
，好行藏。
　　絕世無雙，不比尋常。盡吾戲調何妨。止應配我、個樣新郎。謾眼空勞，心妄想。興
徒狂。
　　書罷，見扇骨上細刻「劉一春」三字，乃知蓮之念己，更覺愈不能遺。
　　至晚，蓮梅秉燭相對而坐。梅曰：「劉生顯兩番手段，皆為我等輕舉深入之故。試以幾
日堅壁不出，彼敢斬關而入否？」蓮曰：「然。」遂強習女工。
　　生自假山會後。懵懵如癡，錯錯若寐，食焉而不知其味，坐焉而不知其處。寐焉而不
知其旦，或入大堂，或趨講丈，或歸書室，或游別地，眼之所見，意之所接，皆假山也。
蓋無根而情自固矣。書史之功頓廢，筆硯之事頓忘。或低吟樹下，或從步池邊，或登眺小
樓，而蓮梅蹤跡，絕不可見。一日，邀友楊文陵訪文仙。文仙迎生，有笑容，多喜意。少
敘杯酌，酒半酣，欣欣相告曰：「別後思君，如心懸一物，恐妨君正業，不敢奉迓。前為君
卜一筮，昨為君起一數，又以君年月日時與知命者推之，皆大魁之吉兆也。吾亦閱人多矣
，多伶多俐，多才多美，無逾於君。當奮祖鞭，以看花上苑。得君捷，妾亦分榮矣。」生
謝曰：「愛我哉！金石之論，可寶終身。」別文仙而歸。復至假山，春景融融，終不能忘前
遇也。取錐刻一歌於竹：
　　四際春光入望中，杏開十里紅霞簇。
　　兩對黃鸝調嬌舌，三聲五聲新腔曲。
　　喚起離人百感傷，千愁萬恨填心腹。
　　不如意事常八九，雲雨巫山空二六。
　　何如一醉忘世情，同與七賢坐修竹。
　　書畢，轉至晴暈亭。有素紙一幅，柱上偶懸一針，生持之，且思且行。忽見小桃一株
，夭夭可愛，猛記紅雨亭之詩，歎息曰：「此芳桃也，能解吾意乎？」乃以師處桃花掛色屏
絕復以針刺之，以針定於蘭室之壁上而回。遇愛童持玉簪花來，種於花壇。命童往視蓮室
。
　　蓮方繡一袋。童至，曰：「前見劉相公有香囊一枚，自謂精絕，今蓮娘所制更妙也。明
當與一賽。」蓮曰：「劉相公為誰？」曰：「名一春，字茂華，號熙寰，改號愛蓮子。」曰：
「何處得來？」曰：「家重疊山華村之西。」曰：「何為家汝家？」曰：「吾主相識之子。」
曰：「今何不去？」曰：「吾主延致攻書，圖其聳壑昂霄耳。」曰：「學問何如？」曰：「去
年游泮，文武兩全，鴻才海富，逸思泉湧。」曰：「為人何如？」曰：「制行英卓，動容俊
雅，立志溫和，趨向超拔。」曰：「家望何如？」曰：「故家子，讀書種，仁人之裔。杜中
丞、郝中書欲謀為婿而不就，故今欲俟寶窗消息，可以知其為人矣。」蓮見生清揚逸灑，
已動心注，而聞童之言，企仰俞真，謂童曰：「汝為劉生修一生譜牒，作一身行狀。」俟
童回，私歎曰：「是天遣此生以貽相思之種也。初見若爾，後將奈何；見猶若爾，別將奈
何！斷送一生，惟有此矣！」愈覺足不寧地，強梅以觀花為由，將窺生室。而愛童歸，
正與生道及碧蓮詢生之語，立於窗外。蓮乃返至花屏間，見二絕句：　凝目花間憶粉腮
，一腔煩惱逐春來。
　　花如解得無聊意，長向劉郎悶裡開。
　　又詩：
　　小門晝永春岑寂，安得斯人共一牀。
　　自是洛陽花下客，劉郎不是老劉郎。
　　蓮謂梅曰：「汝解此絕意乎？乃改集句詩也。詩意極巧，小門『小』字，改『千』字
也；一牀『牀』字，改『觴』字也；自是『自』字改『曾』字也；不是『不』字，改『
今』字也。初，劉原父以年老續婚，故謂『老劉郎』；今彼寓小洛陽為客，明示我以未曾
有婚之意。然以岑寂，何預他人？而遽欲斯人共一牀，則傷於欲速而無禮」梅曰：「彼謂『
斯人』者，何人也？」蓮曰：「斯人者，斯人也，必求其名以實之，則鑿矣。」與梅並立，
久無語。梅曰：「何思？」蓮曰：「吾亦欲改集以和。適為詩才所窘，安排句法，已難尋，
較是輸他一首矣。」梅曰：「還有一首。」袖出一絕，與蓮觀之，乃針刺成者。蓮見之，
曰：「怪哉！怪哉！異哉，異哉！有是事哉！」梅曰：「何故？」蓮曰：「汝未知來歷。此
吾作於母舅園中紅雨亭掛屏上，亦以寶針刺成。此帖汝得於何地？天地間有此意外偶然
事，其神運乎？其鬼輸乎？竟莫測所自也。」梅曰：「吾昨得於池右之蘭室。意謂蓮娘所
書樣，於形跡太露；使出於劉君，不知何由得之？」蓮長吁曰：「是園素無外人，吾嘗由此
無忌，今與我共之矣。又況豈無他人，當斂足縮步，輟筆息吟，以自韜晦。然吾書此時毫
無著意，自今驗之，似字字有情。苟詩作憑，良緣天啟，則韓夫人之紅葉再流御溝何異也。」　
　　正論間，生推門而出，見蓮梅俱在，步又中止，倚花而偷望之。花面與粉面爭嬌，脂
香與花香競馥，自不忍舍，歎曰：「凡間仙人，可以療饑。」又歎曰：「碧蓮、素梅者，千
萬人中兩人耳。」占詞二闕，書於手帙：
　　愛殺芬芳春一點，嬌姿壓倒楊妃。倚花注目已多時。枯腸聊止渴，餓眼暫充饑。對面
重逢無妙策，費吾一段心機。何時親貼豔豐頤。玉釵掛吾首，羅袖拂吾衣。（《臨江仙》）　
　花滿枝，蝶滿枝，戀戀迷香不忍歸。迎暄曬粉衣。
　　盼佳期，算佳期，盡付書齋懶睡時。春情許夢知。（《長相思》）　　
　　蓮歸，猶折花在手，蝴蝶繞花而飛，梅曰：「蝴蝶有情，相隨不捨，其為花乎？其為蓮
娘乎？」蓮曰：「愛花則為花，愛我則為我，何怪蝴蝶之迷戀也。」命取筆，書一《愛花詞
》於東簷之壁：
　　一枝花外漾新晴，賣花聲裡春光泄。正解語花嬌，山花子豔，後庭花未結。猛睹蝶戀花梢，也須索賞宮花，沉醉花陰歌笑徹，待醒來，向柰子花前，木蘭花畔，鬥百花奇絕。莫放雨中花謝，落路花飛，斷送了賞花時節。等閒間落花紅滿地，又早見石榴花吐迎新熱。金錢花散美人愁，菊花新處情人別。冷清清開到臘梅花，意孜孜揉碎梅花雪。（二十牌名）　　
　　後生見之，料蓮所作，笑曰：「花固可愛，豈知春可惜乎？」對一《惜春詞》，並書於後：
　　春從天上來，春霽和風扇淑。沁園春景巧安排，花柳分春，有流鶯宿。單衣初試探春令，喜的是畫堂春滿，錦堂春足。那更慶春澤畔，正雪消春水來，有魚遊春水分波綠。玉樓春盎日初長，忽看海棠春放，春光好，好看無拘束。又何如登帝春台，賞漢宮春，謾醉春風中，齊唱徹宜春令曲。體輕放絳都春光，武陵春去，春雲怨惹愁眉蹙。（二十牌名）　　　題罷，回至壇前，抱膝而坐，心自計曰：「吾之見蓮者，邂逅也。吾之寓此者，暫也。吾之窺蓮者，私也。蓮之愛我者，幸也。彼此之傳情歌詠者，禮所禁也。吾志之所期者，未可必也。知微翁所云者，渺茫之數也。而蓮之年則已及笄，而必有他適矣。吾欲乘邂逅之暫，觸禮之所禁，僥倖以行吾私，焉保其不他適而必符此數、必遂吾志乎？使我後日要醜婦，則我當為我惜，而彼亦當惜我。使彼終身伴拙夫，則彼當為彼惜，而我亦當惜彼，眷眷情緒，兩下湮沉矣。然既生春，又生蓮，天若行方便，必無此事也。」悵悵然自為問答者久之。又欲至文仙處以散積悶，值守樸翁帶二歌童攜酌於閒閒堂。生醉甚。翁斟大卮勸生，生力辭。守樸翁曰：「吾羨子有八斗之才，倚馬可待，今以情字為韻，若能立就一絕句，吾當代子飲之。」生即應曰：
　　燕春台外柳梢青，晝錦堂前醉太平。好事近今如夢令，傳言玉女訴衷情。（八牌名）　　　守樸翁素質直，初不知生之寓意有在也，但笑曰：「玉女，即嫦娥也今秋必要高中。」盡歡而別。
　　後蓮睹生所對之詞，歎曰：「何物老奴生此寧馨兒！美口聲，錚錚乎敲金戛玉；賣俊俏，藹藹然惜玉憐香。如百戲場中子弟，件樣精通，風月前容吾二人唱和，足稱勁敵。悠悠蒼天，悠悠蒼天，有志難酬，仰呼無益，萬般心緒付之一聲歎吁！若挫過此生，則春風徒笑我矣，乃以春、花二字結之：
　　雕欄春色上花梢，花底春鶯巧更嬌。
　　春為花開添富貴，花因春到逞嬌嬈。
　　花容不久春空老，春景無多花暗消。
　　幾欲留春花言，落花春夢杳迢迢。
　　蓮此詩書於片紙。偶愛童持瓦盆到池邊覓取小魚，梅見之，親至，問何為？」　
　　曰：「劉相公近因興悶，欲取置几案，竊其活潑之趣耳。」梅遞蓮詩於童，曰：「興趣在此，何以魚為。」童曰：「何故？」梅曰：「汝不《見愛花》《惜春》二詞乎？今兩下合而為一，見之則興自活潑矣。」童奉生，述梅之言。生閱之，不覺鼓舞。
　　自是，蓮常凝目窗外，又恐生之見，又恐生之不見；意欲絕生，情不忍絕；意欲許生，身不敢許；每羞澀依依，有不可形狀意。面對小軸，美女怯春圖，蓮戲之曰：「吾因春無奈耳。爾無知，何作此鬱結狀也？」乃賦於其上曰：
　　萬斛新愁眉鎖住，凴欄不賦啼鵑句。
　　終朝理恨幾時舒，良二難畫相思處。
　　多情對此愁千緒，心隨風逐沾飛絮。
　　不如將心托筆寄丹青，落得不知春歸去。
　　（《步蟾宮》）　　
　　又書一詞於綠窗之側，濃淡筆，短長句，以堅生志、寫己怨也。
　　春山愁壓慵臨鏡，憶芳菲，嗟薄命。望中煙草連天，座裡花陰斜映。空度流年，虛浪美景，誰把佳期牢訂。對景怨東風，無語垂簾靜。----狂風浪蝶多情興，爭抱一枝紅杏。鷓鴣隔樹喧聲，喚動惜春心性。燕子雙雙，鶯兒對對，花也枝枝交並。
　　蓮書未畢，因慶娘處女使至，亟入接問。少頃生至，誦之，知其為《晝夜樂》詞而末韻未成，取筆續之曰：「百物總關情，何事人孤零。」（《晝夜樂》）時鸚鵡處於檻內，連呼：「有客。」生曰：「客是誰？」蓮於內低應曰：忽到窗前，疑是君矣。」自為捲簾，見生猶執筆而立，對生曰：「有客。有客。」生執其筆，相揖於隔窗。生曰：「只分窗內外耳。我見蓮娘多娬媚，想蓮娘見我亦如是也。」蓮未及對，忽回首，梅立於後。曰：所言公，公言之。」蓮逸別室。生曰：「主人何避客之深也？」猶不忍去，撫窗窺內。梅亦曰：「何為至此？得非欲窺見室家之好乎？」生曰：「為室家不足，無奈看花洛陽，以收天下春。」梅又含意曰：「先生儒者，當折桂枝，醉春紅，占春魁。今穿花至此，豈三年力學不窺園者乎！」因笑倚窗側，以袖拂生。生亦倚身窗外，以手撫梅曰：「蓮娘情何如？」曰：「不濃不淡。」生曰：「繡戶春風暖，想蓮娘心熱矣。」梅曰：「青燈夜雨寒，恐先生心冷耳。」正謔間，蓮至，命梅煮茶。梅少退。蓮至前，將露私言，似欲接手，而童已至。梅內指曰：「鬼僕又來矣。」各默默而散。童曰：「適來王謝諸公來訂文會，叩門至軒中，吾善計回之去。恐夜來攝蹤，識破行徑，故唐突而來請。」生曰：「甚是。」步至東，坐於湖山石上。愛童拂拭落花。生曰：「昔日相逢，碧桃初放，今梅酸濺齒，春氣將闌。天上好景，人間樂事，顧不為我一留也。」作詞送春：
　　殘花無奈黃昏雨，那更更長苦。枕頭聽得子規啼，叫道春光今去幾時回。----東君不管離人老，花信憑誰討？一生須得幾青春，盡在書齋做個憶春人。
　　次日，生憶玩詞之處，已深感蓮之惠然肯近，而尚未能接一心話。會愈多則情愈戀，話更難則念更深，雲破月來之時，花落門扃之際，皆惱人滋味也。占《賀聖朝》詞：
　　疾心偷步巫山下，枉自擔驚怕。
　　胸前著次，心腸乾熱，誰人堪話。
　　書中之女千金價，甚日青鸞跨？　
　　心似風箏，身如傀儡，懸懸牽掛。
　　又《春光好》：
　　春已矣，樹浮青。少啼鶯。數點催花雨，美聲不可聽。
　　心事千頭千腦，幽齋孤影孤形。誰問玉人曾約否？半應承。
　　又三字詩：
　　月升樹，花影重。酒未醒，愁又濃。
　　蓮亦自風生之後，常無言靜坐。素梅侍側，一目視蓮，久不移。蓮曰：「視我何為？」梅曰：「近來善風鑒，能模心相。」蓮曰：「何如？」梅曰：「口內無言，心中有事。」蓮曰：「然，今日情思不爽，兼倦人天氣，恨不能寄愁天上，埋憂地下。第取琴，試操一曲，餘音似前弦。」梅為之設几焚香，置琴於上。蓮方整弦，遽曰：「指力倦，琴音散，不若以棋較勝負。」梅又為之設棋枰。下未終局，遽推枰而起。自理繡工。又曰：「眼昏，不便針線，暖酒較手技可也。」酒至未飲，則曰：「恐醉，姑置之。」梅曰：「消遣我太甚。今日何異常日？如此，信必有故。」蓮曰：「予實不知。」梅曰：「他人有心，予忖度之矣。」蓮曰：「無浪言，為我捲簾，細數落花，何如？」梅掀簾，曰：「外間世情甚不美。」曰：「何故？」曰：「綠暗紅稀，飄零顏色，春去矣。」蓮喟然曰：「春去乎？春亦解誤人乎！」梅曰：「春不誤人，人有誤春者。」蓮曰：「吾惜春，非誤春也。」梅曰：「惜春何不留春？」蓮曰：「春肯為我留乎？」命取手軸，書曰：
　　夜雨生愁　
　　煙雨妒春聲不歇，無故把繁華摧折。看欹網留春，斜兜花瓣，不放東君別。
　　隔檻下香和恨結，淚滴處衣羅凝血。正冷落佳人，柴門深閉，剛是愁時節。
　　（《雨中花》）　
　　春風積怨　
　　春風幾度，空把青年誤。古道堆紅無數，妝點東君歸路。
　　樂事於今半已空，園林綠遍消紅。咫尺窗紗，萬里衷情，吟付東風。（名《青玉案》）　
　　靜裡淒寥　
　　鬧嚷嚷春景無涯，近一簇香車，遠一簇香車。雨篩風攪攘韶華，打一夜梨花，飄一夜梨花。心病也，意兒慵，對一霎紗窗，倚一霎紗窗。情重也，淚兒枯，歎一聲冤家，念一聲冤家。恁黃昏簾幕重遮，鼓一部青蛙，送一部青蛙。
　　（名《閨怨蟾宮》）　
　　望中索莫　
　　小鳥窺人驚枝去，一聲啼歇。
　　蓮方書，梅笑曰：「劉先生於窗外多時矣。」蓮曰：「何不早言。」欣然投筆而起，探首外望，乃誑也。蓮甚不快，遂置前詞，和衣而臥。而生果至，梅復曰：「劉先生於窗前候久矣。」強之不能起。久之，梅誑生曰：「蓮娘見君至，反就枕。」生曰：「其似恨我乎？梅曰：「非惟恨，抑且恨。」生曰：「容我一見請罪，何如？」梅曰：「君罪太多，罪不容於請。」曰：「我得何罪？」梅曰：「竊窺鄰女，眼罪也；吟賦詩詞，口罪也；攀花弄管，手罪也；勤步窗前，腳罪也；用意輕薄，心罪也；私聞竊聽，耳罪也。然連日疏闊，一身都是罪也。」生曰：「前諸罪可恕，末後一罪，我自認之。」遂悒悒而回。
　　至晚，蓮於枕上問梅曰：「劉君此際果岑寂否？」梅曰：「有守桂在。」蓮曰：「汝比得守桂否？」梅笑曰：「然則蓮娘其岑寂乎？春色惱人眠不得，當坐以待旦。今日春闌，當高枕無憂矣。」蓮不答。少刻，梅假睡，蓮頻呼之，不應，曰：「年幼未諳傷春也。」梅聞之暗笑。蓮視殘燈尚在，起而獨坐，書一歌：
　　花落啼鵑後，紛紛逐晚風。與我似相識，輕輕入簾櫳。春色殊憐我，傍我頻相從。春光何富飾，也敗風雨中。妾顏花作面，春去誰為容？膏沐懶去事，綠雲成飛蓬。蘭室怯情曉，停針倦女工。春去知還在，春疇情轉通。驀地有長吁，茫然興復空。寄語傷春者，為我惜飛紅。
　　越數日，生與其友關世隆、張文杰者，游酌於園中。未幾，諸葛鈞至，相與暢飲於萬綠亭。世隆曰：「今日劉、關、張復會於桃園，可無侑酒者乎？」文杰笑曰：「憑軍師處之。」生曰：「吾熟一妓，招之則來。得一點紅，足以消酒。」遣人邀文仙，則已去跡多日矣。生稍興，勉強聯句，俱至大醉。生滌手，獨至池邊。適蓮捲簾，面池獨立，因生手揮殘瀝，授一帕於外，帶一香囊。生拾之，左右瞻顧，欲以稱謝，而愛童先諸友至，蓮遙見，長歎避之。生忌友之覺也，即與偕返，送友出。命童訪文仙所在，乃知鴇兒之故，欲賣之，恐其不允，貽之行者。故去數日，而生不知也。生聞，似有所失，舉蓮帕，檢視繡袋，更憶文仙所贈，又亂一心曲矣。作詞念之：
　　章台多柳枝，此枝世稀有。愛爾美恩情，到我十之九。別來夢亦勞，天涯幾翹首。思卿卿在心，念卿卿在口。料卿也同心，有我相思否？
　　又因投帕之惠，扣手歌《鳳凰閣》詞：
　　記當初花下，分明傳約。思量就把芳心托。豈料書生福薄，竟成空諾。能勾向他行著腳？----你也不合，常把眼來睃著。怎知書幌添蕭索。奈何哉，這病根幾時芟卻。直若到空梁月落。
　　自後思情愈濃，心懷恍恍。素梅亦悉蓮之情，恐蹈他故，再四以言語而試之。蓮笑曰：「汝欲以絳桃碧桃、三春三紅之事待我，如傷風敗欲諸話本乎？」梅曰：「此事恐非兒女子所可自行。劉君前程萬里自遠大之器，就之恐玷彼清德，絕之恐喪彼性命。差毫釐而謬千里其端在此。勿謂素梅今日不言也。」蓮正色曰：「何以劉君為惜哉！女子之身，賤之則鴻毛，貴之則萬金也。鼎當有耳，豈不聞女子妄從可賤，汝弗疑。」長歎不語者移時。復謂梅曰：「自思天下有淫婦人，故天下無貞男了。瑜娘之遇辜生，吾不為也。崔鶯之遇張生，吾不敢也。嬌娘之遇申生，吾不願也。伍娘之遇陳生，吾不屑也。倘達士垂情，俯遂幽志，吾當百計善籌，惟圖成好相識，以為佳配，決不作惡姻緣，以遺話把。吾度劉君之意無不可，草草之事不難為，而所以不敢輕舉妄行者，蓋長慮卻顧耳。然劉君之用情於我者，專矣。日月凡跳，如隙駒壑蛇，深欲息意不思春，恐報劉君之日短也。」作一詞：
　　一睹仙郎腸欲斷，斷腸枉自癡癡。癡心長日擬佳期。期郎還未定，定有害相思。思深偏切愁人夢，夢中添下孤獨。惶惶淚滴幾多時。時動文君想，想在俏相如。」　（《臨江仙》）　　
　　倚牀而坐，體若不勝。梅曰：「弱體不勝衣，為郎憔悴多矣。」蓮曰：「憔悴無傷，恐不能自悴憔而止也。」梅亦慮老父覺之，勸以勉強笑語。良久，蓮笑謂梅曰：「汝年紀長矣，名桂紅不諧，私呼汝為紅娘可乎？」桂紅笑曰：「蓮娘欲作崔，使劉君為張乎？今外無高牆，內無夫人，旁無和尚，鄰無犬吠，以培桂迎春為普救西廂何不可？而願時時清白，刻刻崖岸，則向所云『不敢』者，真也？偽也？誠也？假也？」蓮面有慚色，徐曰：「吾欲尊汝故爾，誰為汝演西廂記也？」梅曰：「以桂紅呼紅娘為尊，莫若以素梅為媒婆之為愈尊也。」蓮默然含淚曰：「吾於劉君幸無失德，自以汝可寄心腹，故不少存形跡。今汝舌劍唇槍，吾何為吞聲忍氣？吾拼索性，汝須得乾淨人也？」梅執蓮手，跪而告曰：「吾為戲言，娘何僻見乎？生待我若親，賤奴豈草木人耶？」蓮曰：「汝知否，劉君尚未娶故耳。」　
　　至晚，具雲履一雙、美女一軸、金扇一柄、水晶糖一匣，自取一謎，令梅饋生。梅佯曰：「吾無副，不可行。」蓮曰：「兩國相爭，不斬來使。彼若敬主及使，汝自解紛。」　
　　梅欣欣而行。至迎春軒，獨見愛童，而不見生。將回，童出挽之。曰：「何所聞而來？何所見而去耶？」梅曰：「『禮聞來學，不聞往教』，是以來不見子充，乃見狡童。是以去。」童曰：「凡物必有偶，劉相公已心匹蓮娘，吾與汝未有下稍，汝若肯捨身普施。吾當得好眼看承。兩人深相結，共保快活無憂也。」梅不答。童強之人，與共坐於北窗之小牀。梅曰：「非我求童蒙，童蒙求我。汝事劉相公久，學無賴賊作偷花漢耶？且劉相公尚未有成說，爾何敢僭先？」童曰：「高材疾足者先得焉。劉相公亦讓我一頭地矣。」為之摟定香肩，持素手，鬆鈕釦。而生睡已起，遽推門出，見二人之狀，戲之曰：「臥榻之側，豈容他人鼾睡耶？」童曰：「非敢越禮，特欲小試，為行道之端耳。」梅有慚色，斂衽整衣曰：「君可謂入幕之賓矣。」因視童而微笑。生亦目童，作搖首狀，童即避出。生執梅之手，引就坐，曰：「吾設此位以待卿久矣。今日之事，須極熱為之。」梅曰：「兩國相爭，不斬來使。」生曰：「蓮娘之意何如？」梅曰：「已受重戒而來，不許，不許！」乃以碧蓮徹夜念生岑寂之語、假寐之事，悉對生述之。生曰：「肯念我之岑寂哉？得蓮念，勝天憐念矣。然念念不忘，我心更切也。」又曰：「汝年幼，未暗傷春，我當教汝。」梅曰：「汝男子，那識女情？我亦生而知之，不勞尊誨。」因袖出蓮所貽者與生，曰：「此蓮娘雅贈，欲得君詳一謎也。」生細玩之：「雲履無底，美女在胸。」笑曰：「吾揣其意回之。」　　
　　禁足書窗外，幽懷且放開。謾言心地熱，苦盡自甘來。
　　生曰：「是否？」梅曰：「得之矣。」梅回，見童於窗外。童曰：「恐蓮娘冷靜，代汝奉陪。」又附耳曰：「謝我方便之恩。」逕自笑回。
　　至晚，生以香扇墜一個、玉縧環一副、枕頭席一領、老人圖一幅奉答。囑童奉蓮，曰：「亦欲詳一意耳。」蓮收之，復於生曰：
　　要弄偷香手，終存竊玉心。若能同枕席，永賦白頭吟。
　　生得之曰：「知我者其蓮乎！」　
　　自此以後，雖絕步於園中，而馳心於池側者不能忘，乃抵書投地曰：「原初來意，本欲尋新溫故，以期進取。今所遇若是，雖孔情墨守，何以堪之。抽黃數墨之心，易為倚翠偎紅之句；登天步月之想，翻為尤雲雨之情。然只愁佳人難再得，不憂富貴不逼人也。」書一短詞於扇面：
　　寂寂寥寥度此春，朝朝暮暮兩眉顰。重重疊疊眼添新。句句聲聲心裡事，孤孤孑孑客邊身。思思想想意中人。」
　　（《浣溪沙》）　　
　　帶愛童，鎖外門，赴叢芳館會。
　　蓮偶至軒前，撥紙窗窺之，見琴側有一對云：
　　惜花恨春去，折桂待秋來。
　　又見紅紙帖云：
　　覓蓮得新藕，折桂獲靈苗。
　　喜事福人書。
　　蓮細思不能解。適几上有幅花箋，乃書一歌行，並二絕句：
　　自思忽自笑，甘為何等人？句中說秦晉，筆底約朱陳。我意欲作假，君心要認真。聞道洛陽花似錦，偏我來時不遇春。
　　絕句：
　　月清秦閣冷，雲近楚山低。春色剛來至，東君錯放歸。
　　又：
　　霜節透高枝，橫窗月上時。成林應有日，可待鳳凰棲。
　　素梅忙至，曰：「此劉君寓室也，哪敢獨行！幸不至，使其卒至，則書室為陽台矣。」蓮曰：「好容易！是誰敢？」梅笑曰：「極會，敢極。會敢者，劉先生也。」蓮曰：「吾亦不敢。」梅曰：「不敢請耳，固所願也。」蓮曰：「吾亦不願。」梅曰：「願是不願，不願是願。」蓮曰：「吾無願乎爾，子為我願之乎！」梅曰：「兩相情願，各無異悔。」蓮不答，亦不欲行。梅曰：「忠言不入，炫玉求售，非計之得也。」逕先去。蓮初意以生無一面之識，無一絲之因，適一時之遇，才一窗之隔，今而至於朝暮見，且兩月餘，男子所無之事，識禮甘犯之，而尚不及罄一心談，著意制《桃源憶故人》及《賀新郎》二詞，素梅睡，懷以探生。偶生他出，意已不悅，又值素梅見之，不可久持。乃留一戒指並原制二詞於詩箋上，以界尺壓之，仍閉窗而去。
　　生歸，童先見而拾之。至晚，生就月坐於壇前。童曰：「適於几上得解慍方二紙，寬愁散一枚，可以療鬱結之疾。欲得之乎？」乃以詩箋、戒指呈生。生曰：「得於何來？」童曰：「此必蓮娘之貽，親至不遇，留而去之。然幸吾先收，使他人得之，奈何！」生曰：「彼亦諒吾室無別至者故耳。然機不密則害成，當用為戒。」生誦之，至「放歸」「不遇」句，思蓮有枉就意，深自悔曰：「近來跬步不出，不見親次玉趾，今偶爾他適，即失此良晤，豈瞰亡而來與？豈好事多磨而然與？數之窮、命之蹇、緣之慳、會之難、運之厄、遇之否，一至於此！信事之成，不在於人之計較也。」乃集古詩成興體四章：
　　林有朴樹，其葉蓁蓁。靡日不思，西方美人。----野有蔓草，維葉萋萋。窈窕淑女，洵有情兮。山有蕨薇，其葉　　。我之懷矣，曷其維忘。隰有萇楚，其葉蓬蓬。子無良媒，憂心有衝。（林有朴樹四章，章四句）　　
　　又沉思：「留一戒指，不知寓何意？或戒我休折野花乎？或戒我休生妄想乎？或戒我休忘此情乎？或戒我休荒書史乎？或戒我休得苦心頭乎？或戒我休得急心性乎？或戒我休得遽思歸乎？或戒我休對人前說破乎？」心焉惶惑，排解更難。而蓮又以微恙少出，素梅終夜不離左右，生欲求一面而不可得。乃畫蓮花一枝，肖己像於側，名曰：「愛蓮圖」，懸於書壁，常常對之。想其坐，則曰「座上蓮花」；想其貌，則曰「面似蓮花」；想其詞，則曰「口出蓮花」；想其行，則曰「步步生蓮花」。又畫梅花一枝，題其上曰：
　　鐵石肝腸冰玉肌，風中雪裡逞標枝。慇懃結爾一知心，為春傳送新消息。
　　每對此二書，則悠悠蕩蕩，愁喜交集。
　　一日，微雨初過，躍魚戲水，生帶愛童，釣於隔浦池。吟云：
　　化龍原有日，暫伏在清流。萬丈深潭難設計，且將蚓餌釣鼇頭。早上金鉤，早上金鉤。
　　蓮先見之，謂梅曰：「劉君深深諳釣術，所謂水濱之役夫也。」梅曰：「釣術何如？」蓮不答。梅喻其掀簾指生曰：「臨淵羨魚，何不退而結網？」生聞之，即抵窗前。梅其窗曰：
　　休念佳懷休假呆，好將啞謎細論猜。我家門戶重重閉，春色緣何得入來？
　　生索然沮興，曰：前日作情方沐，而今日又復變卦，焉得以隔浦池目為浣溪沙，以培杜軒署作心院乎？」即棄釣歸室，將愛童而睡。
　　睡起，即令童取酒，生至醉，枕書隱几。聞扣門聲，放之入。乃金友勝，因至書坊，覓得話本，特持與生觀之。見《天緣奇遇》，鄙之曰：「獸心狗行，喪盡天真，為此話本，其無後乎？」見《荔枝奇逢》及《懷春雅集》，留之。私曰：「男情女欲，何人無之？不意今者近出吾身，苟得遂此志，則風月談中增一本傳奇，可笑也。」送友勝出，愈醉不可及，復隱几而臥。
　　又聞扣門者，乃守樸翁內姪耿汝和也。是人刻而妒，奸而險，唱和每出生下，而反好勝，---稍輕之；又嘗對生求守桂，生不與，故有憾於生。是日偶至，見生具有《燭影搖紅》一詞，盡含風味。且素知他側居一女，心甚疑之。而生尚酩酊，汝和因強生解其詞。生朗誦一遍，因被酒，漏言曰：「吾心可成金石，雖蘇張更生，弄轉圜之舌，不能間我愛也。」汝和乘醉以言挑之，生笑曰：「吾始睹其貌，心之而不置，吾既得其詞，手之而不釋，意為同志相得與？」汝和故作不解。生吟曰：
　　隔池美姬，女中解魁。今朝重睹西施。奈情猿怎持？興言念之，心如醉兮。縱然今夜于飛，恨佳期已遲。
　　（《四字令》）　　
　　汝和曰：「此事何所據？」日袖出碧蓮《桃源憶故人》詞遞汝和觀之，曰：「汝虛甘罪，所供是實。」愛童計不知所出，適欲接之，而汝和即懷去。生曰：「自我得之，自我得之，亦復何恨！」又大笑就寢，童捧之而睡至夜半言之，而生瞀然而記也。徐徐問其詞，生曰：「昨日果大醉耶？」童尤之曰：「三爵不識，因可多乎？小事糊涂，而大事亦糊涂。此何等事，而可不避人目？風流罪過，已今供招，而又虛名禍者，奈之何！且耿生素肯發人之私，今又得此，必是報聞於吾主，自疑圖禍隙矣，久念使人驚怖。」生彷徨曰：「怪哉！喜為憂恨，福為禍本，吾志從此體，吾行從此劣。豈非禍從手發耶？」又曰：「吾固無足惜，奈玷蓮娘何！乃知酒之流禍矣。許文仙真聖人也，許文仙真聖人也！」因繞几而行。童亦不樂。生曰：「汝未知我心，近日心事有勢不得行者，但欲醇酒求醉耳。」　　至午，守樸翁招生與汝和飲於私室，生再四不欲行，久之，曰：「詩云：『豈不欲往，畏我朋友。』我之謂與？」勉強赴酌。汝和對生微笑，曰：「酒道真性。」又曰：「勿憂，明早還汝。弟憐幾月好用心，羨汝一人獨專樂耳。獻出守桂，自有商量。」生遂雜以他詞，幸守樸翁不覺。生乃俯意卑詞，小心取貌，不敢出氣。汝和揚揚自得，略不為禮。生勸以大觥，汝和曰：「爾亦欲吾醉，乘中處事耶？故不飲。」生亦不能對。愛童行酒，心抱不平。偷至汝和窗外，濕紙窗窺之，見蓮詞壓於硯側，喜曰：「得來全不費工夫，可謂慢藏矣。劉相公之福，孫蓮娘之幸也。」逾窗竊取而歸。
　　生別汝和，不勝忿懼，而愛童呈是柬詞，道其所由。生如夢初覺，如醉方醒，撫童背謝之，曰：「微子，則吾不知所終矣。今幸全璧歸趙，如合浦珠還，深荷百朋之錫，縱彼能吹毛求疵，亦與白賴而已。」　
　　後汝和失柬所在，意童竊去，呼童質之，將欲白於守樸翁。童懼，先於守樸翁處短之，且捏訴以妒生之故。而是日，生之家童至。生父母以生久不歸，因召之。生默然。然以耿子為嫌，」吾且歸，可以消猜釋忌」。故辭翁欲行，而終不能捨碧蓮也，作回文一絕：牽情最恨別，人仙美少年。
　　又詞一闋：
　　風裡楊花輕薄性，銀燭高燒心熱。香餌懸鉤，魚不輕吞，枉把鉤兒虛設。桑蠶到老絲長絆，針刺眼淚流成血。思量起枯枝花朵，果兒難結。海樣深情忍撇，似夢裡相逢，不成歡悅出水雙蓮，摘取一枝，可惜並頭分拆。猛期月滿會　娥，誰知是初生新月。折翼鳥，甚是于飛時節。（《花心動》）　　
　　生將行，私囑童曰：「耿生為吾所輕簡，實為汝故，致成嫌隙，汝亦當自愛。吾去後，老翁前有萋斐，汝亦當周旋粉飾。」童曰：「相公至此，愛敬者無分小長。此人齷齪傲視，吾家大小皆嫌。吾已於主翁前道過，彼雖置萬喙，決亦不信。但行矣，不久且當奉迎。」生至園中，見蓮窗緊閉，料不得見，作詞付童曰：「蓮娘處為我申意。」即日辭行。汝和終有憾於生，於翁前暴其過。翁終以先入之言為主，而心不直之，乃曰：「劉生至日，吾夢見池中一鯉化龍，一春即乘之而去。吾重其所夢，慕其為人，因處之於此，期飛揚為吾光。且視彼待汝亦謹厚，故汝陷人不義，乃面朋面友耳。吾不願汝曹有此行也。」汝和愧且恨，自至生寓，見窗壁題吟，愈嫉之。托以覓生為由，逕達蓮所。
　　時蓮與梅共坐窗下，相與談生，曰：「久不見劉生，近日不知作何狀？」梅曰：「劉君者，國士無雙，人物第一，必非久下人者也。」蓮曰：「何謂？」梅曰：「劉君有何郎之貌，有子建之才，有張敞之情，有尾生之信，惜其淹揚子之居，塞田洙之遇，是以晝興賈生之歎息，夜懷宋玉之悲傷耳。今乍與之會，如飲醇醪，不覺自醉矣。」蓮曰：「吾所見亦然。但昨晚夢劉君別找而回，我留之，彼云：『被人妒陷，聊以避謗』。初不知其故也。」　
　　適耿汝直至前，蓮與梅不及避。汝和遽曰：「劉熙寰在否？」梅曰：「吾處深閨，君處書室，是惟風馬牛不相及也。孰為熙寰？君為誰？其誤入桃源矣。」汝和曰：「吾乃耿相公，為《桃源憶故人》，故至此。故人知君，君不知故人，何也？」梅無以對。汝和又誑曰：「劉一春本微家子，吾輩羞與為伍。今得罪於吾翁，已作逐客，決無復來之理。汝若戀戀有故人情，乃明珠暗投耳。」逕拂袖笑聲而去。
　　蓮聞之，惶惶如有失，嗚嗚不能語，茫茫無容身之地，謂梅曰：「知人知面不知心。此必劉君不能自慎，以致露醜於人。情慾之事可遣，失身之罪難逃。今後宜吞刀割腸，飲灰洗胃。免使青蠅玷玉。」少頃，又見汝和昂然往來丁隔池，揚言曰：「迎春軒今為吾行樂窩矣。」蓮曰：「劉君必被此人妒陷無疑，斂跡避狂，料有以也。」梅曰：「劉君挽不留，耿子推不去。使劉君若在，豈使耿子至此！」值守樸翁至，汝和潛回。
　　蓮令梅密扃其窗，非事則不啟，以避耿也。
　　次日，愛童扣窗不獲，轉至欣欣亭後，見蓮、梅共立於石榴樹下。蓮邀童入，問其故。童亦為生諱之，蓮懷少釋。童出袖中雲箋，曰：「此劉相公辭帖也。」拆觀之：
　　萬種相思未了償，被人生嫉妒，又參商。花前笑語尚留香。輕別也，能得不思量？　　寄語囑蓮娘，莫忘前日話，換心腸。好將密約細端詳。卿知否，吾意與天長。（《小重山》）　　
　　蓮未知生來期，情不能捨，亦成一詞。
　　二郎神去竟何之？重疊山西。亭前柳樹空啼鳥，滿庭芳草萋萋。我怨王孫薄倖，聲聲謾訴淒其。長相思憶舊游時，春鎖南枝。而今仲夏初臨也，疏簾淡月容輝。試問阮郎歸未。奴嬌怯誰知！（《風入松》十四牌名）　　
　　愛童歸，正遇汝和於迎春軒。汝和笑迎，問之曰：「汝自何來？」曰：「來處來。」不顧而去。汝和嗔之曰：「媚劉子，牽蓮娘，蔽主耳目，皆此頑童，其過之首罪之魁乎！」然汝和雖妒之，而至此亦未如之矣。
第三卷    
　　劉生覓蓮記（下）　
　　生於守樸翁家，行舟出門，聽一讖語：忽一小舟相值，二書童各執蓮花，相與聯句曰：
　　馥馥碧蓮花，有分歸吾手。異日掇蓮房，取次求新藕。
　　一駕舟者曰：「大官好捷才！決中，決中！」生驚喜曰：「此即知微翁『覓蓮得新藕』之句也。數與讖合，或者其有驗乎？」行未二里，又遇一舟，聞笙鼓聲，乃生友樂昌時、卜可仕挾妓高巧雲、包伊玉游碧荷渚，激生過酌。舟艤而行。巧雲曰：「曾得文仙蹤跡乎？昔與吾為姊妹們，行動坐臥，心心口口皆劉相公也。」生喟然曰：「紇乾山頭之雀，不知漂泊何所，蘆花明月，尋亦無處，身不由己，琵琶別舟。今見卿，又動往想矣。」各別而歸。
　　家居將旬日，獨行，獨步，獨坐，獨吟。買樂無文仙矣，吟詠無碧蓮，矣傳情無素梅矣，承值無愛童矣，想迎春軒之景益切，則抱耿汝和之恨益深。常書空作「咄咄」語，默地自念隱語曰：「吾當火燒其耳，水淹其目，木塞其口，不足以泄其恨。」當食食忘，當寢寢廢，雖父母亦不解其意也。
　　一日，會一奉、一泰於友仁館而回，獨處書樓，見月散餘輝，形影相弔，歌曰：
　　巒嶼獻翠兮，天際雲開。雲際月來兮，光浸樓台。清光瑩澈兮，照我孤獨。孤影相弔兮，遐想多才。
　　次日整騎，往萬石山探友。適舟自南來，推篷者，守桂也。生於馬上問曰：「胡為乎來哉？必有以也。」童曰：「奉主翁命來請。」生返騎，曰：「不去則辜蓮，欲去則忌耿，如進退掣肘何？」童曰：「耿氏為吾主不悅，已隨父至遼東。吾來時，蓮娘、梅姐皆有私囑，此行安穩，不必猶豫也。」生以手加額曰：「此天助吾！」辭父母啟行。父囑曰：「守樸翁為我契交，汝當執弟子禮，用心舉業，無孤留汝意。」生受命登舟。童曰：「頗懷蓮娘否？」生出新制《半天飛》曲。命童唱之：
　　花樣嬌嬈，便有巧手，丹青怎畫描？越地把芳名叫，能勾在懷中抱？倘就了鳳鸞交，我再替你畫著眉梢，整著雲翹，傅著香腮，束著纖腰。多媚多嬌，打扮做個觀音貌。不羨當年有二喬。
　　費盡心情，他作怪蹺蹊不志誠。假意兒胡答應，不顧我添新病。實為你漸勞形，只落得吃著虛驚，挨著殘更，撫著愁胸，怨舒前生，雙眼睜睜。無韁意馬難拴定，何日堂開孔雀屏？　　
　　即晚抵舊寓。時守樸翁構一亭於隔浦池上，初成，上署一匾，浼生書之。又晤知微翁之數，欣然大書曰「覓蓮亭」。心自喜曰：「又增我一樂地也。」　
　　次日，天色暄熱，生設几於無暑亭中。命童取文具，連揮數幅。有迎春軒之詩，有晴暉、萬綠亭之歌，有閒閒堂之記，有蘭室、無暑亭之詞。皆各書以真草篆隸，字字龍蛇，章章星斗，煥然新目，整飾可愛。守樸翁創一見之，不覺鼓掌曰：「重勞珠玉，蓬篳生輝。」　
　　薄暮，置酒覓蓮亭中，邀師生共賞之。生視池中，有並頭蓮數枝，慶幸不置。翁曰：「吾種荷幾年，今始睹此蓮，蓋為子而瑞也。」生讓不敢當。時月東升，正照蓮紗窗，生凝眸熟視，若欲飛渡。忽其師扣桌歌曰：
　　新亭趁晚泛霞觴，槐陰微剩雨餘涼。鴛鴦躍處晴波　，開遍荷花鳳亦香。夜闌披月扶歸去，醉誦《南山》詩一章。
　　守樸翁亦作一詞，名《秋波媚》：
　　碧天夜色浸閒亭，荷香帶露清。身邊皓月，杯中詩思，分外風情。
　　臨風對月聯詩句，詩成醉亦醒。一觴歌罷，萬聲俱寂，四壁空明。
　　其師與寧樸翁命生為覓蓮亭詞，生承命曰：
　　向晚新亭共賞，荷開香溢壺漿。愛蓮情似藕絲長，心與波紋蕩漾。
　　欲把蓮房掇取，宛隔在水中央。鴛鴦兩兩睡黃粱，做個宿花模樣。（《西江月》）　　
　　守樸翁笑曰：「少年詞趣，自是逸灑。」取筆，命生書於粉壁。題曰「愛蓮子一春書」。翁喜，對生談乘龍之夢。生暗幸，以為乘龍佳婿。盡歡而散。
　　生酒後與師占《百字令》：
　　脂唇粉面，記相逢，才是傷春時節。耽憶貪思，又早是、捱過兩三四月。用盡機關，搜窮計較，滋味空親切。言挑語弄，兩下都無體歇。欲待丟下冤家，悶心頭、繫了千繩百結。病態愁腸，暗地裡，不覺吞聲哽咽。憂怨之心。相思之病，萬口渾難說。有分乘龍。畢竟尋個歡悅。
　　有頃，愛童對生曰：「相公覓蓮亭詞嫌於太露，恐耿生之外有耿生也。
　　後翁果以覓蓮亭之詞，憶耿汝和之言，追思閒閒堂之句，亦不能無疑於生。忽留童於內，命女使繡鳳送茶果。生晚謂童曰：「自至此，未見女使。今日獨遣美婢至，果何意？昔有倚草附木之妖，得無以我獨居而竊至弄人耶？」童曰：「婢名繡鳳，吾主所愛，不必外疑。但我家家政甚肅，無分毫犯清議。前有耿子之說在焉，知不以此試真偽邪？」生大悟曰：「汝言亦大有理，真智囊也。」　
　　越日黑晚，又留守桂，命繡鳳攜酒果，至則扃其門，鳳從容以大卮勸生。生視之，比前加衣飾，有比昵態。生曰：「久有守桂，何勞汝至再？且幕夜無人，使我不安。請歸內。」鳳甚愛生，真不欲即行，目生曰：「守桂有他事，未得陪。因無人，故至此。昔耿官人欲求伴少刻而不可得，今反不欲我一伴耶？」生曰：「誰遣爾來？來意何謂？」鳳曰：「遣命出家主，既來之，則安之，亦當惟命是從矣。」生曰：「君子不為昭昭申節，不為冥冥墮行。汝在此，無能損我。如嫌疑，何敢酒一卮。」謝而遣之。未出門，守樸翁帶愛童候於門外已久，進與生敘談，夜分而回。生倍服童之言，而守樸之疑冰釋矣。
　　蓮自生歸之後，意緒沉沉，百不經處，惟翻閱書本，檢考詩詞。几上有《草堂詩餘》，信手揭之，見《卜算子》詞云：「有意送春歸，無計留春住。畢竟年年用著來，何似休歸去。目斷楚天遙，不見春歸路。」掩卷歎曰：「是詞能道吾心中語。」改其末韻云：「繡閣佳人也是愁，暗淚飄紅雨。」是時蓮之表妹邵慶娘，乃母姑之女也，幼常居處，甚相得，以冬間於歸，恐又不得會，特至候蓮，蓮父留之。故蓮雖知生之已至，而不敢窺園者數日。生亦自以來久，不獲一見，心亦疑之。且蓮以汝和之事為戒，生以繡鳳之試為嫌，彼此兩存形跡。但令童往覘，亦不識慶娘。不敢交一語而返。生候晚，乘月縱步，又聞蓮父笑聲徹處，作六言、七言，自吟而回：
　　相遇美人未偶，綠窗恨我東西。一笑陽台夢到，依然秦嶺雲迷。
　　　　七言　　
　　一自花飛怨杜鵑，誰知今日尚無歡。平生欠卻鴛鴦債，捱盡相思思未完。
　　後慶娘方歸，蓮又以母舅樂水寢疾，偕父往視，獨留梅看家。
　　生次日至其處。梅於覓蓮亭上倚欄看花，見生，口稱：「久違！」即訴汝和之事。生問蓮娘啟處。梅曰：「舅氏有疾，父子往探，剩吾作空房主人。索居閒處，難免沉默寂寥，無人惜我之孤零也。」生曰：「客齋旅榻，自歌獨詠，有愁如海，精衛難填。吾為汝心動神疲，其如汝堅持雅操何！」梅含笑曰：「今晚不棄，開窗以奉歡笑。」生佯曰：「吾正人，豈可近花月之妖？使愛童伴汝。」梅曰：「所謂己不用而使子弟為卿者也。然則君言果不足信乎？」生曰：「真戲耳。敢忍自外，非人情也。」　
　　生晚造之，梅推窗曰：「自南過荼架，轉欣欣亭，則可以入此室矣。吾將俟君以著乎。」而生入蓮房，極其精潔，紗帳垂鉤，寶爐香裊，鏡台春盎，翠簟風生。房之內房後窗外有花壇花屏，盆魚鳳竹；內列瑤琴，並文几玩器，旁一桌，有詩詞史籍。壁間張小小詩畫，皆蓮親筆。側側小房，凡女工所需之物咸具。東池一室，蓮父設榻，扃其門，不可入。生曰：「自海棠開後，望到如今，未由親履，今幸睹之，如入仙宮、游月窟，敢忘盛德之權輿乎！且為耿汝和秉心不良，特與吾為水火，今乃遠行，豈非數乎！「因坐於內房。梅自出整小酒。時春台上有花盆，尚留一朵，生戲題於粉壁；　
　　東君瞞我去何急，望中翹首追無及。忙重韶光去收拾，遺下一枝芳可挹。我今笑折手中執，嬌客一睹喜交集。貫來不許啼鵑泣，醉中常對胭脂濕。
　　梅具酒進房，時几上有宋玉《諷賦》、司馬《美人賦》。生方閱之，梅乃施其上服，表其褻衣，自橫陳於生之旁，逸興飄飄，若不可已。生曰：「佳人先有情乎？」梅曰：「情之所鍾，正在吾輩。情之一字，莫須有。今夕之會，上至天，下至地，東西南北，惟吾兩人在也。當兩下舒暢，以勾夙帳。自非天崩地陷，夫復何憂？」生猛思曰：「宋玉尚不忍愛主人之女。長卿猶不肯私自陳之姬，吾所以用意於碧蓮者，蓋欲謀為百年計耳。彼素梅縱為侍女，亦良家處子也，何得波頹瀾溢，以亡污清質乎？」乃氣服於內，心正於懷，取筆書：「不可」字於粉壁。梅曰：「君子當灑灑不羈，吾不忍先生苦心，折節自獻，烈火乾柴，已同一處，君何得無丈夫志？且嘉會難逢，何陽拒之深也。」生曰：「欲心固不可遏，然須於難克處克將去，使吾為清清烈丈夫，卿為真真貞女子，不亦兩得之乎！」梅曰：「向與童將諧而遽休，今與君將歡而見棄，然則君將為口頭交而已與？」生笑曰：「此天欲以完節付二人故耳。且色膽天大，慾火易燃，識透則不為所使。若前緣已種，而得蓮娘為壓寨夫人，則當使卿為帶來洞主，決不忍舍汝蕭何之妙情，斷不敢忘汝善才之大德也。」相與侃侃正談，舉杯迭飲。梅亦收拾塵心，倍加愛重，曰：「君可與阮籍輩齊名矣。」生曰：「吾非薄情漢，特誓於此生，彌敢失節，故不首為亂階。然見色則為色引，視花則為花牽，終不能遺諸胸中，是吾私也。」命梅啟窗以驗月色。忽守桂持燈來，生命入行酒，因備問碧蓮徇及於舅氏，始知其為業師趙樂水之甥女，大驚異。以知微翁之數、紅雨亭之詩及見碧蓮於隔牆之事，備述於梅。特蓮有《懷春百詠》並平昔得意佳句，集為一帙，題曰「留春一話」。梅聞生之言，心大異之，故並以此集示生。生嘖嘖稱羨，題詩於集後：
　　春心搖曳，無尋蝶使。姻緣簿裡，偷添名字。新詞一闋締新盟，佳配雙成償夙志。（《哭岐婆》）　　
　　天將旦矣，同童返室，即修一書，命人馳師問疾。蓮啟觀之，乃劉一春柬也，亦始知其為母舅之徒。昔嘗一面，今又同園，追思紅雨亭之絕句，蓋天啟也。而情倍念生，不欲久留，幸以舅恙稍可，先父而歸。
　　甫入門，即問梅曰：「汝曉我與劉君異事乎？」梅曰：「不曉。」曰：「汝知劉君在乎？」曰：「不知。」曰：「汝見劉君面乎？」曰：「不見。」曰：「劉君來乎？」曰：「不來。」曰：「汝曾一去乎？」曰：「不去。」曰：「然而劉君又回乎？」曰：「不回。」曰：「劉君怪我乎？」曰：「不惱。」曰：「何時學得此二字文！然而劉君忘我乎？」曰：「何日忘之？終身不能忘。」曰：「劉君思我乎？」曰：「豈不爾思？去後常相思。」因指壁上之句，曰：「此劉君親手書也。」指集後之詞，曰：「此劉君親筆寫也。」指內室之牀，曰：「此劉君親身坐也。」蓮作色曰：「我略不在，汝引賊入界，汝私於劉君已不可言，而顯跡留壁，更不忌老父覺之耶！」自起為滅其跡。梅曰：「彼自詠花耳，關渠何事？」更述生行止端方，和而不流，料今訪古，蓋不多得。蓮閉目搖首曰：「孰有盜跖而施仁義者乎？入寶山而空手回者乎？伶俐人至此尋汝學本分者乎？」梅曰：「予所否者，天必厭之。謂予不信，有如皎日。」蓮曰：「天日哪管此事？」梅又盡道劉君好處，譽之不啻口出。蓮曰：「汝譽劉君，舉之如欲升之天，進之而欲加之膝，異日容吾試之。」　
　　逾曰：守樸翁雙壽，蓮亦往賀。蓮父與生與外席。酒酣，翁與眾賓散步園中，歷歷指引，閱生佳作。蓮父甚重生，恨相見之晚。
　　次日，蓮父具酌於舍，邀生雅敘。生規行矩步，色溫貌恭，口若懸河，百問百對。蓮父愈敬之若神。生歸，蓮父醉寢，蓮出立於葡萄架下。生望之，奇葩逸麗，景耀光起，比常愈美。生步近低聲曰：「仰蒙款賜，未及請謝。」蓮曰：「草率奉屈，幸荷寵臨。」生曰：「久不會談，可坐一談否？」蓮曰：「家君不時呼喚，可速回，改日當話。」忽聞窗內人聲，蓮急行，墜下金釵一股。生抬之，曰：「客中乏荊釵之聘，此殆天授也。」珍藏入室。
　　至次晚，蓮使梅至，索釵。生執梅之手，曰：「事急矣，惟卿可任大事，安劉者必卿也。苟推心置腹，使我如魚得水，敢不報效曹公乎！」梅曰：「先生且休矣。倘畫虎不成，有何面目見江東父老？」生曰：「巫雲綴玉，眩眼撩心，情若投膠，勢同陌路，吾方寸亂矣。」梅曰：「君衷志不回，慕柳下惠之不亂。向使蓮娘首肯，而君一曰『宋玉』，二曰『長卿』，一曰『烈丈夫』，二曰『貞女子』，以謾講道學，則彼顏之厚，何以自洗？」生曰：「酒逢知己飲，詩向會人吟，然騏驥惟孫陽睨盼，彼若不以先配為可恥，則吾自另有制度矣。」梅曰：「二人所談，所見略同。但婚姻重事，非一小丫鬟賤女流足以了此。」生曰：「舉目無親，知心有幾？卿其圖之。」笑書一曲曰：
　　密約多遭，杳杳無消耗，火噴襖神廟。卿卿當鵲橋。低駕天河，早渡仙娥到。春意沁鮫綃，那時當贈纏頭報。（《步步嬌》）　　
　　梅曰：「恐力不足耳，敢望報乎？」生付釵於梅，曰：「願如是釵，早得相會可也。」贈以玉環、小詩一絕：
　　會貪隔薄蓮，難禁花心動。要結玉連環，先會釵頭鳳。（四牌名）　　
　　梅行，目生笑曰：「天下有如此癡人，乃知宋王、長卿未是俊物。」　
　　生送梅出，攜童坐小樓待月。須臾月來，命童取酒邀月而飲。生知蓮父赴里社日休會，而二女獨居，命童取琴，鼓而吟曰：
　　彼美人兮。巧笑倩兮。美目盼兮，婉兮孌兮，終不可諼兮。
　　乃如之人兮。我不見兮。念我獨兮，勞心慘兮，使我不能餐兮。
　　子兮子兮，履我闥兮。燕笑語兮，行與子逝兮，無使我心悲兮。（《美人》三章，章五句）　　
　　蓮亦剛以步月在外，聞琴聲，呼梅聽之，笑曰：「劉君無道理，乃以琴心挑我，使誘人套子。琴雖工，其如我之不好何。二人切莫理會，令其興沮，彼且歸矣。」蓮口雖寬，而心實急，蓋欲梅贊己行也。而梅不解意。故蓮足欲行而趑趄者屢屢，命梅期生曰：「我倦欲眠君且去，明朝有意抱琴來。」　
　　次夜生往，久候不見，倚池側石欄望之。惟見窗內隱隱有燈，且陰雲四合，有寂寥意，長歎而歸。蓋蓮意以生至，必抵已室，又羞顏於先往，故假寢內房，命梅候於窗下。梅亦趁涼誤睡，及醒時，生已回。蓮至夜半不睹生，以為生反爽信矣。
　　次晚，生命童先睡，復至亭畔。聞欣欣亭後有洞簫聲，清亮可愛。頃之，碧蓮為懶梳妝狀，持鳳簫，扇掩酥胸而來，飄飄若仙子之下臨凡世。見生，佇立不動，生迎而揖之。蓮側身斜視而拜，舉簫謂生曰：「虧吹此以引鳳凰。」生大喜曰：「卿其真蓮娘耶？其　娥耶？其神女耶？吾其真見耶？其餓眼生花耶？其醉中夢裡耶？」蓮曰：「凡胎欲質，何勞誤愛如是。」回頭顧後，又復四望。生曰：「何故？」曰：「我極熟素梅，見之猶覺有畏心。」生曰：「我極熟愛童，見之未免有疑心。蓋欲心則起畏，私心則生疑，情固然也。」蓮曰：「夜來有約，何忍背之？」生曰：「卿自背我，我何曾背卿也。」蓮笑出一詞，云：「昨夜候君子不至，作此記悶者。」生月下觀之：
　　懶上牙牀，懶下牙牀。捱到黃昏整素妝。有約不來過夜半，念有千遍劉郎。
　　生躍然曰：「吾昨夜候卿不出，亦作一詞，見之絕倒，大為奇事，卿試閱之。」　　
　　朝也思量，暮也思量。滿擬今宵話一場。人面不知何處去，念有千遍蓮娘。
　　蓮失色曰：「如是哉，如是哉！只此可作一番話本。非一心一口，何由一詞一意？得君子如此，不負平生。今當以二詞為一闋，名曰《同心結》。」生曰：「是則然矣。月下止吾二人，眼前意卿一決。」蓮佯笑曰：「今止談風月，醉翁之意不在酒，面後心事，束之高閣可也。」生曰：「半榻旅情，一腔苦思，無剖訴，憂心如酲。今俯降玉顏，賽郭翰仙女，大慰祈望多矣。月白風清，暢懷可意，能念我之孤零而見憐，亦苦盡甘來之惠也。」蓮曰：「吾無七寶枕，奈何？」生曰：「會合分離。在此一舉，毋作寬寬話。」蓮執手曰：「會久矣，思切矣，兩相信深矣，惡風波經歷矣，得事君子，願亦遂矣，遇亦幸矣，千怨萬怨盡除矣！假未結髮之真夫婦也，少生攜二，當以一個字了餘生，夫復何言！」固倚身生懷，生欲強之，同至迎春軒中。蓮曰：「如斯而已乎。君子未室，下妾未嫁。怨曠兩生，情投事引，粗容鄙質，固不敢有辭於君子，但星月盜歡，終為野合，倘樂聚未幾，朝吳暮越，則樂昌鏡破，延平劍分，縱君子有書中之玉，妾當為泉下之塵，是可慮也。歷觀古今之情勝者，惟娛目前，不思身後，故往往扇醜揚污，他美莫贖。妾與君子足稱一世佳配，焉忍遽自輕之！」生曰：「將奈之何？」蓮曰：「求我庶士，迨其謂之。幸君子不棄，浼一伐柯，訂為婚好，庶得以白首相隨，殆愈於偷香竊玉多多也。妾見熟矣，豈君子見不及此乎？」生曰：「吾欲迷魂湯，不食益智粽，故昏昏至此。浼媒誠非絕德，求親亦非犯禁，向所謂退而結網者，此與異日下玉鏡之台，坦東牀之腹，則今雖生與蠻夷居，日與魑魅游，依依然百千萬日所不辭也。但擇婿在尊翁，聘婦由吾父，二人雖同心，恐未免成齟齬耳。」蓮曰：「上蒼配合，尺寸不爽。且為子擇婦得妾焉，何患君家見棄？為女擇婿得君子焉，何患吾父有辭？但所慮者，數與福分耳。然心已許君子，身豈有二三，君子詳之。媒妁固非妾所浼也。」生曰：「謀事在人，成事在天。然據吾所見之數，以度所遇之緣，以驗將來之福，則料在必諧。進謁吾師，適逢佳句，一也；遊學逢舊，不期又遇，二也；耿子起妒，已值遠行，三也；年齒相若，默契同心，四也。至於事之必成，則注定已久，曾向與梅姐露其端，而未與卿卿說其詳耳。」　
　　蓮喜問其故。生曰：「吾初春謁吾師之前一日，鳳巢谷有知微翁，精數術，吾投問之，許我『佳配』二字，又曰『覓蓮得新藕』。故向一見卿於梅下而已動心，今再見卿於池側而即留意，豈知前後所見即是一名。故荷亭之匾吾即名曰「覓蓮』，以應前數；所謂得藕之藕，蓋必佳偶之偶也。不然，卿固深閨豔女也，無故而相窺，則視生為何等輕薄子哉！」蓮曰：「信有是，則相如當北面，文君甘下風，吾二人數，豈偶然也。」因共至覓蓮亭上以瞻是匾並《西江月》詞。二人凴欄倚肩而坐，雖牛女之夕不減也。蓮曰：「今夕何夕，巧笑之---，其嘯也歌，如此邂逅何！相思之債，今日可勾，姻媾之好，今宵親訂，百歲千朝，幸無輕棄。恐蛟龍得雲雨，終非池中物，異日富貴，無忘今日在池亭上也。」生曰：「卿可為深慮矣，天下豈有負人一春子哉！」蓮曰：「今夜視昨夜，心事霄壤，第不知後夜視今夜何如耳。」各各相視而笑。蓮曰：「禮之至嚴者，男女也。妾與君子略無夙昔之好，而吟風詠月，至傾腹吐心，是禮外之情也。吾二人行事，何異牆花露柳哉！」生曰：「不然。情之至重者，男女也。生與卿卿已有半年之會，而守信抱負，絕寸瑕點辱，是情中之禮也。吾二人心事，則如青天白日矣。」　
　　又攜手共至假山，以宣春間不諧之鬱。時團月在空，皎皎如晝。生細觀蓮，撫其肌體，瑩然冰姿，湛然月質，深自慶曰：「無福也難招也。知微翁預占我為喜事福人，豈應在卿身上乎？鈍口拙舌，敢申一贊，實非虛譽，卿以為何如？」　　
　　嬌滴滴，月下芳卿。笑欣欣，自可人情，兩山淡淡，雙水澄澄。軟軟柳腰弄弱，小小蓮步徐行。綠擾擾宮妝雲挽，微噴噴檀口香生；濃豔豔臉如桃破，柔滑滑膚似脂凝。紗袖籠尖尖嫩筍，一種種露出輕盈。詩句兮燦燦，歌韻兮清清。天造就齊齊整整，裊裊婷婷。真真的苧蘿堪並，端不數崔氏鶯鶯。呵，今日裡諄諄盟約，何日是意融融、樂陶陶，遂一鉤新月帶三星。
　　蓮曰：「嘉獎太過，恐盛揚之下，其實難副，深自愧也。」　
　　時愛童睡醒，夜已過半，久不見生，探步蓮處，適逢素梅於外，二人各言其故，大笑不已。童曰：「孫劉二人終非好相識也，私期暗約，已及數月，不為城闕奇逢，必為丘中樂事矣。」梅曰：「蓮娘賢女子也，劉君真君子也。大德不逾，烏有苟行？兩為才炫，少露鋒芒，久有積心，覓期望罄，必相與步月清談。試往尋之，休得驚恐。」童目梅曰：「半簾良夜風和月，一對青年我共伊。樂時樂地，無以逾此，願以其所有易其所無，而了所未了，何如？」梅曰：「且不了罷。」童曰：「吾有對句，還我便罷。」曰：「何對？」曰：「守桂官，培桂軒前逢桂姐，得其所哉。」梅應曰：「愛蓮子，覓蓮亭上哄蓮娘，不可道也。」童曰：「好對。同往何如？」梅曰：「不便。」　
　　童行未數十步，二人背月而來。生問曰：「何至此？」童曰：「睡醒無
　　聊，偶成《西江月》詞，會中無以為樂，敢弄斧班門，以助一笑。」蓮躡生足，曰：「去。」生曰：「聽，無傷也。」童嘻然曰：
　　東舍多情才子，西鄰有意佳人，看來何等熱親親，恩愛一言難盡。
　　不見不勝縈掛，乍逢乍覺歡欣，可憐未遂洞房春，常把詩詞傳信。
　　蓮笑曰：「強將之手無弱兵。昔有弄臣，今有弄童，童殆在之匹矣。」生曰：「童比得素梅否？年幼未諳調情，吾常岑寂也。」蓮曰：「何為有此語？」曰：「吾得於假睡中。」蓮定睛不語，隙地而笑，不與生別，逕去。生與童返，稱蓮之真見厚情。
　　蓮至，求門不得。梅曰：「為蓮娘逾垣而相從，故我閉門而不納。」蓮曰：「兩賢豈相厄哉？」梅放手，曰：「適劉君攜手而同行，何乃過門而不入也？乃又拱手曰：「今夜親遇盜跖，入寶山、學伶俐，岑寂之債勾完否？」蓮以實告，曰：「此事惟我能之，亦惟劉君子能之。身親經歷，殆信汝向日之言不我誑也。然吾極惱假睡者。」梅沉思曰：「何謂？」曰：「竊聽人言。」曰：「非假寢，何由得真言？」蓮曰：「何以對人言之？」曰：「可與言而言，表蓮娘獨寤寐之真情耳。」後生得蓮約，不能自舉。
　　忽一日，守樸翁至，語及通家話，情義懇切。命童取酌，飲於荷亭。生指女室，問翁曰：「吾數日前見一女於隔池，前日又睹二女於隔窗，儀容秀雅，氣象閒都，得大家風範，何與吾丈同園，而且不限彼此也？」翁笑曰：「看得何如？君欲得之否？」生曰：「焉敢望此。」翁命守桂：「至吾書房匣中，取寫就啟來。」啟至，乃守樸翁奉生父者。翁持啟謂生曰：「此吾鄰孫氏女。其父，前日會中滄淵公，少吾一歲，為至交者。無妻兒，止一慧女，故付產於我，就吾室居，已及五載。是如德色雙全，寫作兩妙，嘗自矢不配凡子，是以高門望族求婚未獲，吾子得此佳配，所謂君子好逑也。因未稟命尊翁，未敢擅舉。明日宜結婚姻，當達是啟，以為撮合山。」生喜甚，且感且謝，曰：「知微翁驗矣。」　
　　次日，翁遣人至生家。生父特至守樸翁家懇媒，乃知生父與蓮父為同庠友，昔同交遊者也。守樸翁即過孫氏議，譽生為佳坦。而蓮之母舅樂水公適有書至，蓮父與守樸翁共觀之：
　　承命遍閱多士，無可為甥女配。吾徒劉一春，人中雋也，百長俱備，一躍可期。執斧者至，即可慨諾。玉潤冰清，緣分甚雅。智生頓首。
　　二人執此書大笑，二媒不約而同，益信婚姻之數定矣。蓮父曰：「此生，金石君子也。小女多緣，倚此玉樹，附此松柏，有何他辭。」　
　　蓮父名士龍，號滄淵，曾補庠生，雅好山水，不干仕進，行樂二十餘年，自訪友吟酌之外，別無營心。家資素厚，而止得蓮。初，蓮之母善相，對蓮父曰：「吾女懷生頗異，當穎敏出群，後必有放達之才。才充則性逸，然少心昂然，幼貌端莊，逸中有檢，萬無一慮。且夫主必貴，因夫貴及可預喜者，恨吾不及見之。爾得所依，生女勝生男矣。」後母喪，滄淵嘗為女卜婿，屢對趙樂水曰：「吾欲覓一快婿，以托終身。若得才郎雅稱斯女，餘無計也。」及守樸翁偕樂水書至，故欣然從之，即訂擇日行禮。蓮曰：「天豈從人願乎！」梅曰：「二人花前月下，萬約千期，月下花前，千期萬約，都為乾熱，而媒氏片言寸柬，即成終身姻契，信哉『娶妻如之何，匪媒則不得』也。」笑成三五七言：
　　月之前，花之下，用盡兩家心，說了千般話。冰人雙腳繫絲，天河早願銀橋跨。
　　紅蓮喜，奉生書曰：
　　妾自覿君子，情竇絲牽，言句不法，熱中無能自持。蓋自幼失儀，蹈此醜相。反躬沉思，汗顏醜貌，過蒙不賤，屢暗惠私誠，邀盟星月。妾恐寒盟貽哂君子，是用眷眷切慮，寤寐永歎，若墜深谷。何幸自天作對，得侍蘋蘩，俾數時花月情，假諾成真，眉睫耀喜，夢寐增榮。自此對時，夙恨灰散。前日無聊之句，不屑睹矣。快中草布，素梅即刻可遣回。外象牙香筒一對，玳瑁筆屏一面，不足珍，供文几一玩具。酷吏欺人，萬千寶貴，寶貴萬千。妾蓮斂衽拜。
　　又細字書曰：
　　據有定配，此柬實為贅詞。喜不自勝，聊以志喜。筆札有罪。
　　生得書，曰：「蓮娘心多，欲汝即回。吾與汝今有瓜葛親親之情，幸敘不妨。」梅曰：「人苦不知足，既得蓮娘，復欲外生根業耶？守志不終，恐宋玉、長卿笑人，蓮娘候久起疑矣，姐夫不懼哉？」生即復書：
　　重佩卿愛，仰奇無涯，筆舌難謝。追思唱酬，得只言片句。如寶和璧隋珠，自揣猶以逾越抱愧，敢望金石月盟，俯締絲蘿而不鄙予？又荷雲箋，心口盡詞飛示，客窗得此，如病渴懷嚼清冰，令人心骨適爽，泠然解恨。梅姐不敢久留，謹以琥珀珠二枚、水晶鎮紙一座奉答。前墜金鐲，陪我岑寂之思，甚不忍忘，謹附璧上。餘情慾露者，弗憚梅姐再往復。春生再頓首。
　　次日，守樸翁以七夕，設酌小樓。散歸，坐月，梅至，邀生至荷亭。蓮具攢酌於亭上，曰：「前會匆匆，今家尊以朱陳二家輪約自往，尚三日示回，故假牛女之夕，屈話通宵，以賀喜。」生曰：「今宵比前夜更何如？」蓮曰：「似為勝之。」生曰：「早信數定，梅樹下即可浼媒，何用許多唇舌為花月粉飾文貌？」蓮曰：「得之若易，無比相親，情極始諧，殊為兩快。」因命素梅行酒。蓮及問童，生曰：「今名分已定，不敢與矣。」共與談今古，相敬如賓。蓮曰：「君子可謂風流學士，使寓郵亭，則風光好詞當盈箱積案矣。」生曰：「古有官妓，達人隨地生春，偶通一笑，於官箴、於心術、於陰騭亦無大損。惟知其為驛卒之女，則當以良家人禮待矣。而乃一夜弄醜，故人笑秀實，至今齒冷，若以吾一生心地遇之，雖百熙載，焉能浼我哉。」蓮曰：「假山初會時，君子罪擬得不合否？」生曰：「竹窗私顧時，卿罪亦在未減。然月下之會，乃見真性，此卿之所以為卿，我之所以為我也。」蓮曰：「古人遠絕女色，如防火水中，避溺山隅，良有以也。」生曰：「但存心裡，正何必痛絕而遠之？女有夜投者，吾哀其窮，收之而已耳。今有托妻寄子者，果絕德乎？魯男子者，不能信心、不能克己者也。且天地間無私物，分中所得私何？在夫惟妾，在妻惟夫，無分毫可假。是可苟也，孰不可苟也。此上見得分明，自無難遏之欲。吾與卿熬煎至今，梅姐周旋身側，亦過欲心第一關矣。」蓮曰：「一夜話勝十年書。」生曰：「讀書不識節義字，所學何事？」蓮深然之。時值天光，各各回室。
　　越數日，槐黃逼眼，桂香薰心，生欲赴省應試。蓮知生之踏槐也，繪一折桂圖，書一《步蟾宮》詞於上，命梅贐生。
　　次日，守樸翁送之，曰：「今日此行，准期發解。」生曰：「豈望翰飛，終愁跡滯。但不敢自諉康子，以伴孫山。」抵家而行。途中見山含煙紫，鳥憩翠陰，口吟一絕：
　　落日山含紫，千山鳥樹聲。長途人怯馬，琴劍伴西行。
　　後棘闈戰罷，生獨處一室，功名在心，百無聊賴。城西有一勝湖，碧域千頃，兩岸芙蓉，不斷嬉游，四時蕭鼓，亦樂地也。生步於湖堤，俄陰一舟，坐數游女。近視，一女貌類碧蓮。生祈一讖語，視女曰：「今日遊湖，明日可看迎舉人。」生喜甚，買醉步回，乘醉臥於西窗。良久，見一女逾窗而入。生迎曰：「吾昨游勝湖，有美女貌類於卿，甚加想念，今幸遠臨，客館之樂遂矣。」蓮曰：「別後寤寐思服，此戰君必奏凱，故特遠來。人生樂事，惟在登科，欲以朝夕榮耀。」生呼童備酒，為蓮洗塵。聞一人推門，甚兇惡。視之，乃耿汝和，憤然入室，肆為醜置，以為蓮私奔，特自遼東帶三五惡少至，必欲得蓮。生大憤，以鐵如意碎其首，惡少驚散。忽然而醒，乃夢也。起而坐，聞街上傳捷聲，生以《詩經》中式第十四名。越數日，會同年於公所，作一詞：
　　聖世崇文網俊英，棘闈共奏凱歌聲。譾材誤廁明經史，笑逐諸公學步瀛。初顯姓，乍揚名，忘將方寸負生平。預期學個經綸策，擬待他年答聖明。（《鷓鴣天》）　　
　　生家聞報，賀者排門。蓮作《再團圓》詞，遙為生慶。詞曰：
　　朱衣點額，文場一捷，何樂如之？鼇頭獨佔，龍門躍過，穩步天梯。青雲路上，月中桂子，折得新枝。長安春暖，馬蹄蹀躞，杏花吟詩。
　　時登科錄至馬二臯處，不勝欣慰，而適升兵備副使。有土賊金三重者，稱虎將軍，號百勝戰，聚眾作寇。二臯以生便弓馬，且少年，不欲其連捷，因差人迎生。生欲榮歸畢姻，而偶得此信，歎曰：「人為財役，士為技忙，我之懷矣，自貽伊戚矣！」　
　　及歸，過拜樂水，即拜守樸翁家，於胡處止宿焉。時屆季秋望後，
　　月色正明，夜半，微聞扣窗聲。視之，素梅立月下。生欲求蓮一見。行未十餘步，蓮亦至，賀生曰：「妾聞君子捷，大稱平生。別已兩月，又聞有遠行，傷春未已復悲愁，何日賦歸與，使妾免立石之望也。生曰：「別後值淒涼天氣，莫以我故，致減容顏，惟強飯強笑為佳耳。」又囑梅曰：「久荷深情，未酬分寸，蓮娘起處，為我周旋。」蓮又囑曰：「此去客途甚賒，早晚當護風霜，到彼宜防進退。使群盜未平，須效賦詩退虜，毋必欲殺賊奴致躬冒矢石也。」梅曰：「彼此情非立談能罄，露冷衣襟，難為嬌體。」生曰：「不過三四月，決有回期，拼割今者之悲，以待將來之歡。」各相看而別。次日告歸，求愛童為伴，守樸翁贈之。童亦喜得所依，快心特甚。
　　至家，生父命行。生偕家童、愛童並本縣差送夫役而往。深谷逶迤，而生是涉，高山巖巖，而生是越，途路倦體，離思縈心，占一詞：
　　辭故裡，拂行鞭，人倦長途馬不前。一擔新愁挑著去，謾勞枕上自熬煎。（《搗練子》）　　
　　生抵任，舅氏勞之曰：「爾青年，但知章句，未諳事體，以後出仕、居卿，必有任性使勢、強佔侵奪之弊，若今不肖士夫所為，致往往為人誣訕，羞親辱祖，損德隳名，皆由不曾經歷之故，故人人以少年高科為不幸。此行歷途路、涉江河、任勞苦、經饑渴、冒風霜，亦足以老才堅志。且住衙內，略曉宦情官況，於仕籍上不無少補。故招爾來，可省吾言。」生曰：「然。惟舅舅教之。」　
　　此時金賊死，群盜無首，逃散者多。生喜遣家童歸報平安。囑私致封書於蓮。蓮拆觀之：
　　一別來，隔離別恨關幾重，有如許高大，惟夢中私越以會卿，不知亦開門接我以話一通宵否？抵任後，幸群盜漸散。然日夕難挨，茫茫間闊，吾意八九十月矣，計來未滿旬日。獨坐悉苦，每一念之思，頃迷心忽，浮身如土偶，腸骨欲沸熱，強起步之，竟昧南北。回想荷池之測，如瑤台仙界，如閬苑蓬萊，欲再於此領佳句，何能，何能！各天遐想，無歡有恨，無樂有愁。始知別離之況，在百情中為獨苦。短箋百訴，長漏無儔，無奈，無奈！月夕之囑，言猶在耳，臨燈修楮，心懸妝次矣。短詞達意，崇昭好好。
　　夜闊夢難收，宋玉多情我結儔。千點漏聲萬點淚，悠悠。霜月雞聲幾段愁。
　　難展皺眉頭，怨句哀吟送客秋。蟋蟀牀頭調夜曲，啾啾。又聽驚人雁別樓。（《南鄉子》）　
　　憶思多處紅珠滴，秋葉落添愁。----寂寂孤身客，通信托歸鴻。（逐句迥文《菩薩蠻》）　　
　　蓮讀罷，謂梅曰：「劉君之思吾，猶吾之思彼也。」即集古曰：
　　行行重行行，與君生別離。遙遙萬里帆，茫茫終何之。如何有所思，而無相見期？終須一相見，並得兩心知。（集古兩句體）　　
　　蓮自生去後，已過月餘，未嘗舉目視窗外，未嘗移步至池邊，未嘗試筆揮一詞，未嘗啟口吟一句，惟鎮日靜坐，略習女工。至是登樓，感望中之情，歎曰：「古樹棲成陣，空山葉做堆。如此天氣，奈離人何！」偶成二詞：
　　飄蕩寒風天色憊，帳裡佳人，暗老應無奈。霜裡荷房今又敗，碧蓮冷落無聊賴。盼望郎君天海外，種種新愁，交付誰人賣？為君褪卻腰圍帶，為君兜下傷秋債。（《蝶戀花》）　
　　愁思鎖眉峰，愁損芳容。愁腸寸結淚拋紅。愁對銀燈增歎息，愁轉加濃。----愁自舉金鍾，愁倚屏風。愁聞樵鼓送鼕鼕。愁擁孤衾寒似鐵，愁整薰櫳。
　　俄而素梅至，手持白綾一條。蓮接之，曰：「此綾潔白可愛，足堪題寫。試集古五言古風一章，或珍藏，或遠寄，待劉君子觀之，表別後懷思之意，何如？」碧蓮口念，素梅書之：
　　彼美洛陽子（任濤詩），詞氣浩縱橫（杜甫詩）。學成文武藝（神童詩），於今獨擅名（李白詩）。自嗟貧家子（杜工部），非質不足營（謝惠連）。知子之好之（詩經），憐君如弟兄（杜子美）。喜在常相近（蘇武），勸君勤六經（杜子美）。朗月同攜手（沈約），逍遙步兩楹（曹子建）。生為並蒂花（陸魯望），春風語流鶯（李太白）。分手信雲易（蕭琛），孤槎自客星（杜子美）。自君之出矣，（鮑含輝）凜厲寒風升。（曹植）蓮寒池不香，（鮑泉）蘆凍白花輕。（陰鏗）感此傷妾心，（李白）萬恨滿心聲。（簡文帝）有懷無與言，（王安石）愁吟與獨行。（方乾）欲言無子和，（集詩）緣琴歇芳聲。（韋應孝）玉簪久落鬢，（劉孝威）淹泣閉金屏。（何遜）粉淚羞明鏡。（叟成師）結鏡待君明。（王融）愁人心已枯，（孟東野）金翠暗無精。（宋孝武）所思情在遠，（古詩）回顧覽園亭。（陳琳）升高臨四野，（鮑昭）疏扉望遠城。（簡文帝）寸情百重結，（范雲）望極與川平。（謝眺）遠極千里目，（魏昭）舉目增淒清。（孝武帝）天目孤煙起，（范雲）落景照長亭。（盧思道）久陰結閒幕，（謝惠蓮）層雲鬱冥冥。（陸機）引領還入房，（梅葉）托夢通京城。（王仲宜）夜中枕席冷，（劉平山）挾纊如懷冰。（集詩）幽閨多怨思，（王均）單眠夢裡驚。（陰鏗）自羞無燥，（江總）終憐夢泣瓊。（劉子軍）靜夜不能寐，（魏明帝）歷歷聽鐘鳴。（像章王）欲因晨風發，（李陵）乘之以遐征。（石崇）無由一化羽，（劉孝威）太虛不可凌。（陸機）愛聚雙情矣，（宋孝武）含情易為盈。（謝靈運）獨有相思意，（祖孫）丘山不可勝。（鮑昭）思君加人老，（古詩）慨然獨撫膺。（張茂先）灼灼佳人姿，（陳伯玉）誰能久熒熒。（阮嗣宗）哀哀自熬煎。（韋應物）嗟嗟勞我行。（張九齡）寂寞對寒窗，（蕭子范）淥面照窗櫺。（古詩）光照窗中婦，（蕭子顯）勞歌居寢興。（杜工部）論今無新喜，（張華）愁語醉無醒。（杜工部）梅蕊臘前破，（杜工部）寒華徒自榮。（陶淵明）渺渺杜雲雁，（謝惠連）音音不可聽。（張九齡）春人竟何在，（梁元帝）羈旅尚甲兵。（杜工部）一身千里外，（顧況）卻來猶未能。（周賀）開屏寫密書，（鄧鏗）離恨正相仍。（裴諫）誰謂情可書，（謝宣遠）心悲書不成。（劉孝威）久要諒有誓，（謝惠連）歸舟返帝京。（杜子美）何時當奉面，（左九嬪）相見睛終青。（杜子美）耳與予同夢，（詩經）永副我中情。（陳思玉）梅書畢，曰：「相思之意，若出天成，至矣盡矣！何生無聊？」蓮曰：「予豈忘此？誰無為聊哉？」梅笑而收之。過月餘，生欲辭歸，舅妗懇留，勉強承命。時生接承上下，極謙以周，而又以文詞弓矢冠絕一方，雖鄰郡牧守，無不傾蓋如故。相與賡和唱酬，名目益起。
　　一日，登衙後福全山，其上有留月松房，右招鳳亭，左有馴鶴亭，又前有寄目亭，可以周覽遍望。生坐檯上，愛童帶弓矢至，扮飾俏麗，動止輕活，愈見可愛。生撫之曰：「汝亦為悅己者容耶？」童曰：「聊落他邦無別伴，隨行童僕作親人。相公云云，何也？」生以立石上有一鷹，取弓矢在手，問天買卜曰：「我家父母兄弟無恙，則一發中之。」果應弦而斃。又見古木上一鴉，又私卜曰：「碧蓮無恙，亦能中之。」鴉隨矢落。生曰：「快活哉！異方得一平安信矣。」童曰：「不意能命中如是，紀昌、由基不過也。」生曰：「是不難。」有鷹自南而來，生曰：「吾此外有喜事，則中此。」亦一發獲之。童曰：「即此三箭，可定天山。」生亦有喜容。坐亭上，與談鄉話。久之，見殘照籠鬆，輕淫浮棟，忽動鄉思，作絕句：
　　舊愁萬種推未開，又苦新愁眉上來。
　　無限雲山無限恨，思鄉慵上望鄉台。
　　歸與吟，誇文耀武，圍爐而坐，飲於燈下。更一衣，袖裡得碧蓮舊詞集古一闋：
　　當時書語正堪悲（田晝），不用登臨怨落暉（牧之），今在窮荒豈易歸（郭勿甫）。酒盈杯（韓無咎），撥盡寒爐一夜灰。（呂蒙正）（《憶王孫》）　　
　　又首尾聯環二絕：
　　客病懨懨有自知，相思最切月明時。
　　燈花落燼人初睡，夢入香山帶月馳。
　　夢入香山帶月馳，覺來偏是五更時。
　　雞聲啼落關情淚，客病懨懨有自知。
　　後舅以事公出。有一婢曰雲香，文雅而秀麗，妗信愛之，嘗與生飲，則命香侍之，且許陪飲。舅之婢六七人，皆愛生，而雲香尤甚，備切溫存，常較手技，或與燕笑。生雖與之戲談，而以碧蓮為念，信誓自持，雖暗室相值，雖幽室久處，雖執手相歡，而無一絲苟簡，蓋良玉之溫潤而慄然。涅而不淄者也。然賦性天植，平易可親，雖不媚人，人自近之。故常自歡幸曰：「平生得結兒女子之緣，隨處皆親美麗，以有腳陽春、一路福星目我可也。」　
　　一日，天氣甚寒，香恐生客邊衾薄，躬至生房，檢生寢榻，見几上有花箋書散句而云「枕生寒，孤衾積凍。」香曰：「吾亦慮此，何不早對吾言之？」又曰：「會少歡應少，心多夢亦多。夢中相會時，休使遽分離。無情是雞聲，驚開夢裡人。愁看燈影陪孤影，厭聽雞聲催漏聲。一種相思兩處愁，兩地相思一樣愁。」香看畢，生自外來，覺有寒意，香解衣與生，生即服之。香詢生曰：「適閱數句，何多情思語也？」生曰：「絆跡異方，思有千萬，然亦奈之何！」香撫生曰：「客處宜善排遣，而行有嗟，坐有歎，吾為二哥不祥。」生承香之慰解諄諄，又愛香之溫情綣綣。乃令香閉門，引就牀共坐。撫摩戲而試之。香不為動，自起開門曰：「不可坐此，不愧軒中備酌敵寒，可即往。」生至，妗先已坐定。酒間，妗指香曰：「能歌。」生出蓮詞，香歌之，餘音繚繚，遏雲繞樑。生贊賞不已。與香登望闕樓，聞雁聲，生不樂。香曰：「受恩深處，不殊於家。主母待君，過逾常格，妾雖下賤，亦足隨侍，何乃自苦如是也？」生曰：「汝亦知我心乎？游子思故鄉，吾亦欲歸耳，安能鬱鬱久居於此也。」作歌示雲香曰：
　　臘裡客中身，客身今也久。惆悵登樓豁病時，嘹嚦一聲來雁口。慇懃封信問所之，尺書能寄吾鄉否？雁飛不顧懷人情，我亦無言空翹首。望斷孤飛魂亦飛，孤身常為北風羈。幾樹晚聲送蕭颯，落葉聲中寒侵衣。斜陽滿地鴉知返，何事游子無還期。愁轉加，半牀客夢繞梅花。無際長更眠不穩，催聽寒雞報曉衙。睡起憑高望鄉國，歸途多少雲山遮。
　　次日，生睡方起，忽雲香與真真各折梅花一枝而來，皆以梅奉生。香曰：
　　春在吾家了，慇懃贈一枝。
　　廣平才調好，得韻便吟詩。
　　生獨執雲香一枝，曰：「倒轉又好。」因對香注目而笑，若有所思。真真見生內著雲香小衣，即疑生有私於香而故遺落己也，嗔曰：「色不如，詩不中，奉承不如，梅花亦不如也！」擲梅於地，懷憾而去。生憶碧蓮之遇始於梅軒，雲香之愛不殊素梅，睹物思人，無暇禮真真。香見其去，笑曰：「醜奴兒，又作此狀。」生因作一詞。名《醜兒令》：
　　佳人報道梅花發，暗度香塵。樹綴瓊英，放出梅稍雪裡春。
　　一枝欲寄江南信，傳與多情。望盡長亭，恨無南歸驛使人。
　　殘臘將盡，父母以生未娶，久在外省，而碧蓮亦時有小恙，故遣前價召生。蓮聞之喜，而價私至求書。蓮預以五彩繡線結成二歌，效織錦回文之意，又書一闋於小箋。價至，生得家報，如珍萬金，又得蓮詞，未啟函如見面也。與雲香觀之，香曰：「蘇弱蘭之巧、女相如之才也。」生曰：「汝賽得否？」香曰：「　　之如美玉。」生讀之曰：
　　妾望君兮水隔水，君望妾兮山隔山。惟有夢中情更切，不辭山水接君顏。枕邊夢去心亦去，醒後夢還心不還。而今萬點相思淚，焉能彈點到君間？　
　　夜寂兮不嘩，月明兮窗紗。有懷兮耿耿，所思兮天涯。人素兮誰寄，望目兮雲賒。吁嗟兮忘寐，知心兮燈花。
　　又一《玉蝶環》詞：
　　幾時慵整烏蟬鬢，香消蘭燼。臨牀修楮付親親，淚濕數行書信。
　　近日衷情休問，欲言先恨。君顏遠在五雲端，目與行雲無盡。
　　香曰：「君所匹，有如此蕙。」復他顧曰：「宜乎視我如道旁苦李也。」生略哂之。香又曰：「當寬心。翁歸，須贊行。第下妾緣慳，無由久視君子為恨。」生曰：「清風無老日，明月有圓時，暫時雖不忍，後會諒有期也。」香潸然淚下，嗚咽不禁。生問其故，香曰：「心腹有苦事。」生曰：「何不言？」香曰：「吾志得諧，則不必言。不然，則汲汲過此生，無可言也。」生曰：「汝志度得可諧否？」曰：「易則至易，難則甚難。」生詰之，終不言。生亦不忍舍，小帖書一別詞：
　　多時旅邸遲留，欲歸難。今日未離行處，怕陽關。輕別去，何緣再睹紅顏。一夜清清好夢，到伊間。（《上西樓》）　　
　　香得詞，含淚藏袖中。至晚香亦以小帖書《桃源憶故人》詞，欲以送生：仰君德望山平重，味月嘲風，曾共巾櫛。慚非鴛鳳，情愛無限重。緣慳又值卿心動，念念都成春夢。未到先懷心送，一曲俚歌奉。
　　香方書畢，而主父自外回，置之袖中出迎。至真真房，取帕抹額而二箋俱失於地。初不之覺，彼真真拾之。真真不識字意必有他說，因前憾，上是箋於主父。主父懷之，私謂生妗曰：「雲香吾知其頗識字，不意其工於題詠。然據此二詞，則是婢似有浪子野心，豈以吾甥之循循雅飾者，而亦欲晉情兒女子耶？」妗素愛生，且素憐香，解之曰：「吾察生舉動頗端，常令香為彼行酒。男女各敬愛，故相牽戀如此。觀其詞，足徵其行之無矣。」舅曰：「明日贈之，俾兩情允愜何如？且已為仕途中人，置作別室，無傷也。」妗大喜，俟舅出坐於密室，令小鬟秋翠呼雲香與生來，謂生曰：「汝曾作詞與香否？」謂香曰：「汝曾作詞送行否？」二人默然失色。妗曰：「我知無害，詞落於真真。真真上於主翁處矣！」生大愧，無言而去。雲香跪而告曰：「亳忽舉動，主母素知。可一方便否？」妗備以語之，且囑以弗言。香方釋曰：「塞上翁之意。失馬不足憂也。」至夜又書一箋授生。生曰：「汝慢藏，殃及池魚，今又何詞？王真真知否？」香曰：「君試觀之。
　　雲箋一幅兮偶成功，絲羅有日兮附喬松。
　　與君行兮緬挹春風，我心寫兮，謝彼蒼兮。
　　生沉思曰：「豈易得哉？」亦不以著意。香微笑不止。生曰：「何笑？」曰：「若果有此事，豈不至樂至樂也哉？但今夜明月，無顏見主翁，特至與君書策耳。」生曰：「由他。」又問以前日落淚之故。香又墮淚曰：「妾非君舅衙中粗婢也，原為苗氏之女，小名秀云。賴母訓，通文墨列傳，少負女秀才之譽。父以納粟補官，任府事。過鷹嶺。夜被盜逐散，吾於茂草中潛形。
　　次日，遇府主過，諱姓易名，乞哀求活。雖不以常婢待我，然不得不與真真輩為伍。思親不得見，家無可歸，身未有主，故遇君子不得不動心耳。若得侍君子、事蓮娘，運帚操箕，磨墨捧硯，亦免失為下人婦也。」生憐而禮之，曰：「吾不知，慢卿多矣。然必欲我從，則是謀非吾所能及也。」會秀英與愛童至，香馳去。
　　次日，舅妗設宴餞生，命小童促雲香出拜，衣裳楚楚，威儀棣棣，堂然大家狀也。妗見之喜。生疑，問故。舅曰：「是女非凡婢，可以侍吾甥。汝善待之。客路花枝，少添春色，不必辭。」生喜過望，方悟知微翁「折桂獲靈苗」之句，二書童取次「求新藕」之言，複名雲香為秀錄。生謂之曰：「古人有獲人之女而為之嫁之者，吾為汝擇配正名，汝欲之乎？」秀靈曰：「吾志已決，他非所願矣。」　
　　生偕童輩辭舅妗而行。二臯差人舟護送，各各加厚贈。生在舟中對秀靈談遇碧蓮始末，且曰：「蓮娘新匹，秀靈遠從，人間俊豔，一網收盡，吾當高築銅雀以鎖二喬。昔時素有此志，今果然矣。」至晚，秀靈另設寢具。生強曰：「汝懼真真見之耶？」秀靈曰：「此行幸有終身之托，明日侍幃房、拂衾塌，固不敢辭。但蓮娘未遂於歸，而下妾先承私愛，於心安乎？正嫡妾之分，當自今日始。」生正容謝之，曰：「好議論，吾不如。」　
　　逾數日，舟次於清源市頭，值年家，停舟往候。愛童閒行小巷，數妓倚門獻笑；一妓自騎回，訊之，乃許文仙也。文仙亦認愛童，童即馳報生。生特至，問曰：「汝何至於此？天幸適逢其會。」文仙曰：「君別後，相念惟心，意欲謝煙花、洗脂粉以守君，鴇兒揣知此意，以他詞紿我，與一閩人游，泛舟至此，復陷我，規利而去。前耿汝和過，因與君厚，曾嫁侮於我。若得借升合湘水以救涸鮒，此君夙昔之餘愛也，敢不銜結以報。」因詢碧蓮之事，並生別後情及遠行之故。生悉告之，且曰：「久念真情，今在難中，吾當援拔。」即謀於秀靈，以百金贖焉。生曰：「長條雖近他人手，鸞膠幸續斷弦聲。更相得賀可也。」與之偕至舟中，謂之曰：「此係官舫，更非閩人之舟比。」文仙曰：「向謂得君捷，妾亦分榮，今榮及於妾矣。多謝，多謝！」至晚，文仙亦辭生，薦寢於苗。生曰：「反見外乎？」文仙曰：「側室尚未諧歡，路花豈宜竊趣？俟君歸後，當整舊好，惟命也。」生曰：「汝亦能之乎？好議論，吾不如。家人離，起於婦人睽，汝婦人不睽矣。吾當成汝之美。」生在舟中，伴此二人，歌童曲韻，溢耳陶情，樂極無涯，歡愛有待，可謂登仙舟，行世陶情真奇遇也。
　　後經風巢谷，生慕其前數大驗，將欲問終身事，誠意登訪，而知微翁已滅跡游五山矣。生返舟，值仲春末旬，草色浮青，野菜添綠，而夾鶯花，無異去年春景。生對文仙曰：「汝記得春亭之詞乎？《憶秦娥》一闋，吾二人之月老也。」文仙曰：「有往日然後有今日，誠不敢忘。」又生對秀靈曰：「《上西樓》一闋，吾二人之媒妁也。」秀靈曰：「蓮娘何自而得之？」曰：「紅雨亭一詩，又吾二人之冰人也。」文仙曰：「男女有詞，婚姻賴之。如之何其廢詞也？」各各謔笑。忽愛童指前村曰：「此見龍灣，抵家不及百里矣。」生喜，吟曰：
　　忽指前村近，行行意自欣。風塵他處客，花柳故鄉春。
　　客思歸詩思，新人共舊人。倩言靈韻鵑，傳信慰親親。
　　翌日，至家。武南翁選日為生畢姻。蓮父欲以素梅為從。梅曰：「老父孑居，晨錯當代溫清。」言甚懇切，蓮父不強。
　　佳期已至，生行親迎禮。重以他鄉返旆，獲就新婚，桃夭逞媚，黃鳥喈鳴，正之子於歸時也。樂水偕守樸翁畢集，咸謂：「新郎新婦，足稱佳兒佳婦，遽此佳配，人間絕稀。非先人種德，文福雙齊，何以至此。
　　暨晚，生謂蓮曰：「相會週年，今償此志，想前度劉郎今又來矣。今晚比覓蓮亭上之夜更又何如？」蓮曰：「又覺勝之。蓋假山之會面矣,快心也，琴簫之會心矣而未真也，荷亭之會真矣而未親也。至今合巹之會。」則蓮笑而不竟其言。生曰：「何故？」蓮曰：「自君了別後，勝一日而九斷，心一夜而九飛，引領成勞，破粉成痕，立影對孤軀，含啼私自憐耳。別久而有今日，思久而有今宵，何謂不樂也。」蓮又指自身曰：「此無足貴，但雖與君子幽會多時，而此身仍為處子，亦足以少蓋前愆。使前日惟欲是從，則今宵之愧心愧容，無由釋矣。」生喚秀靈至前，述其言，撫其膺曰：「彼亦仍處子也。」蓮重感而敬之。是晚。共賦一詞，蓮曰：「君有題柱才。」生曰：「卿比生香玉。」蓮曰：「樂意相牽絲幕紅，萬願今宵足。」生曰：「桂榜喜書名。」蓮曰：「洞房諧花燭。」生曰：「並蒂比肓入繡帷，兩兩鴛鴦逐。」（《卜算子》）生於枕上視蓮，若人中之仙也；生自視，若仙中人也。得意處，與尋常伉儷大不相侔。生歌曰：
　　天上　娥降塵世，堆出萬般嬌俏。不棄寒微，德音來教。爭誇天喜加臨，更羨門闌光耀。休談孟光，不數溫嶠。妙、妙、妙！願得卿難老吾常少，謾唱低隨，永賦白頭歡笑。
　　蓮曰：「向欲竊玉偷香，今幸同枕席，白頭之願遂矣。惜不令耿汝和知之。」少頃，秀靈至前，生笑謂曰：「惜不令王真真見之。」又指秀靈，戲謂蓮曰：「不必以此介嫌，未見卿時，知微翁已為我先聘定矣，卿向見『折桂獲靈苗』之數是也。」蓮曰：「文仙吾尚愛之，況於苗乎。」秀靈喜歌柏梁詩：
　　綠紗窗外鶯聲曉，小桃枝上春光好。
　　百年夫婦伸偕老，舊恨前思今日了。
　　蘭香吐篆煙裊裊，紅絲新結同心巧。
　　才郎萬斛明珠寶，女貌千嬌冠塵表。
　　昨宵好合情多少，洞房自有蓬萊島。
　　交頸鴛鴦比翼鳥，樂事應濃愁應掃。
　　雲情雨意方傾倒，綢繆恨卻雞聲早。
　　妾慚體質塵埃眇，荷辱垂青願相保。
　　檀木恩覃思結草，聊成新句歌喉小。
　　蓮曰：「妙哉！始吾與素梅亦頗自許，今又得秀靈，乃知天之賦人無盡，君才之感召一至是也。」愈愛愈敬，呼為「妹妹」。自此家庭之際，其樂也融融矣。
　　生後承父母之命，迎蓮父養之。為愛童娶素梅。文仙歸後，生另處一室，小婢一人事之，待如家人，蓮父、秀靈皆愛之，無間言，衣飾食用，皆與己同。
　　一泰隨發科，同登進士。生任國博，歷任至少參。居官清慎慈和，聽至有去思。父母受封，即乞歸養，捐俸資以周親族鄉鄰之貧乏者。所居之前，辟一花園，廣培草木，饒綠繁紅，引水為池，環以石欄，臨池構小堂，署曰「清白」。堂之後有文昌樓，又後有聚珍閣，遍積古今書史，時閱覽其中。著所得，以立言不朽。池之東，面池一室，署曰「寄趣」。池之西，面池一室，署曰「逃塵」。俱備有玩器。春、夏、秋、冬擇方隅為四亭，春曰「數花亭」，夏曰「來薰亭」，秋曰「晚翠亭」，冬曰「耐寒亭」。堂之前有池，為一軒，署曰「自得軒」。軒之側有觀音堂，文仙朝夕焚香。軒之前有一室，四壁列名人古畫，而置己行樂於中室。左右列兩廂房，前種松、竹、梅，署曰「三友居」。側穿一逕，周繞於文昌樓之後。別置一室，養瑞鶴，列瑤琴，署曰「琴鶴所」。側穿一逕，以四時花木夾道為屏，直通於清白堂前。家政悉宰於一奉。生日與父母兄弟遊樂於斯，或與賓朋劇飲，或與親戚宴集。或與蓮娘游，則必命秀靈、文仙侍飲，以素梅、愛童行酒。熙然春盎，逍遙光景間，耽風月以寄詩詞者將三十年。
　　蓮娘、秀靈事舅姑以孝聞，待一家以順聞。各出一子一女，二子為大儒，一女適名門，夫婦共享上壽。其家五世同居，人人傳婦夫。
第四卷    
　　尋芳雅集　
　　元末時，秋官吳守禮者，浙之湖人也。初，論伯顏專權亂法，蠹國害民。疏上，忤旨，奪職放歸。於是買田築室，以訓子為事。子名廷璋，字汝玉，號尋芳主人。涉獵書史，揮吐雲煙，姿容俊雅，技通百家，且喜談兵事，真文章班、馬，風月張、韓也。守禮欲使子謀仕，生曰：「今何時也？可求仕哉！水溢山崩，熒飛日食，天變不可挽矣。異端作亂，隸卒稱兵，人變不可支矣。兼以侏儒御重位，腥羶執大權，直節難容，奸邪立黨。予家本南人，何忍拜犬羊、偶豕彘乎？有田可耕，有廬可棲，適性怡情，偃仰煙霞足矣，何必披袍束帶，徒為夷虜所貴賤哉！況天人交變，運歷將終，不幾十年，必有真天子出。吾其俟之。」守禮聞言，亦服其識見之卓。
　　一日，以事辭父往臨安，過蘊玉巷，見小橋曲水，媚柳喬松，更有野花襯地，幽鳥啼枝。正息步凝眸間，不覺笑語聲喧於牆內，嬌柔小巧，溫然可掬。暗思：「必佳娃貴麗也。」隨促馬窺之。果見美姿五六，皆拍蝶花間。惟一談裝素服，獨立碧桃樹下，體態幽閒，丰神綽約，容光瀲灩，嬌媚時生，惟心神可悟而言語不足以形容之也。正玩好間，忽一女曰：「牆外何郎，敢偷覷人如此！」聞之，皆遁去。
　　生歸寓，若有所失。情思不堪，因賦詩一律以自解云。詩曰：
　　無端雲雨惱襄王，不覺歸來意欲狂。
　　為惜桃花飛面急，難禁蝶翅舞春忙。
　　滿懷芳興憑誰訴，一段幽思入夢長。
　　笑語無情聲漸杳，可憐不管斷人腸。
　　晨起，再往候之，惟綠樹粉牆，小門深閉而已。俄見一老嫗據石浣衣，生立俟久之，揖而進曰：「牆內何氏園也？」嫗曰：「參府王君家玩也。」生曰：「非其諱士龍者乎？」對曰：「然。」生曰：「彼有息女否？」答曰：「有女二，長曰嬌鸞，寡服未釋；次曰嬌鳳，聘伐未諧。」生曰：「為人何如？」嫗曰：「姿容窈窕，難以言述其妙矣。且能工詞章，善琴弈，而裁雲刺錦，特餘事耳。」生聞之，不覺神歸楚岫，魄繞陽台，而求見之心益篤矣。因自喜曰：「此吾老父契也。備贄謁之，以假館為名，萬一允焉，他日之事未可知也。」　
　　於是持書及門，款曲之際，生進曰：「家君自別麾下，日誌林泉，不獲進瞻偉范，徒佇寞耳。姪因遊學貴地，遍索雅靜居，俱不如意。昨聞名園閒曠，且極幽麗，欲貸少憩習業，未審尊旨如何？倘念夙交，特賜容愛，小子當效草環之報。」王老笑而言曰：「尊翁與朽握手論契，已非一朝，彼此情猶至戚。今君棄家求名，盛舉也，敢不如命。」且囑之曰：「日用之需，吾當任奉，毋使牽書史心可也。」　
　　翌日，生遣隨僕攜琴劍書囊而往。王老乃館生於池亭小閣中。生雖身居書室，心憶鸞娘，採青拾紫之念頓忘，而竊玉偷香之謀益計矣。處及旬餘，心事杳杳，不勝悲歎。然王老見生舉止端詳，言詞溫潤，接人待物，罔不曲盡理道，心甚愛之。雖夫人、二嬌之前，亦嘗以偉器目焉。
　　時台州李志甫作反，朝廷詔鞏卜班總江浙軍事行討，王以武名亦與，因召生謂曰：「正欲與君親益，奈征蠻之制已下，行期旦夕矣。家中外事，望乞支任。」生一一允諾。明日，王備舟促裝，送者馳驟。生晚歸，心幸曰：「待月之事可成矣。」　
　　後一夕，鸞獨坐臥雲軒中，手弄花枝，影碎風旋，爐篆香遺，自念：「金蘭流水，不能倚玉樹而遇知音，其為情也，誠不堪矣！」即呼待婢春英者，－－慧巧倜儻，亦豔質也，－－同至後園集芳亭前，步月舒悶。忽聞琴聲丁丁，清如鶴唳中天，急若飛泉赴壑，或怨或悲，如泣如慕，或有耳接而心恰者。鸞即往，穿窗窺之，見生正襟危坐，據膝撫牀而彈，清香裊裊，孤燭煌煌，望之若神仙中人。恐為生所覺，即呼春英，怏怏而去。歸不能寐，適筆硯在旁，援書《如夢令》詞云：
　　正好歡娛彩幔，何事赤繩緣斷。步月散幽懷，又被琴聲撩亂。情願，情願，孤枕與君分半。
　　自是，口雖不言，心則已領會矣。後夜復至，意為聽琴計也。適生獨立柳陰玩月，鸞不知而突至，見生赧顏，與春英相笑而去。生意必鸞也，欲追不能及，欲舍難為情，因借柳為喻，遂書二律於壁云：
　　沿溪弱柳綠方稠，牽惹離人無限愁。
　　半娜腰肢風力軟，長顰眉黛雨痕愁。
　　章台舊恨成虛度，漢苑新緣欲漫酬。
　　縷縷含情休蕩漾，畫橋之外有朱樓。
　　煙鎖長堤兩渭城，淺妝渾恨別離輕。
　　影臨曲水如無倚，花入欄杆若有情。
　　學舞柔姿輕掠燕，偷眠弱態引流鶯。
　　依稀可惜閒清夜，攀取疏齋續舊盟。
　　生就館三旬，見鸞僅再，心猿意馬，不能自馴。因訪知春英乃鸞得意婢也，欲面求無會。越二日，英獨至園亭採茉莉花，生揖曰：「露氣未收，採何早耶？」英曰：「遲恐為他人所得。」生曰：「今採奉誰？」英曰：「鸞姐酷愛，方理妝候簪。」生笑曰：「然則惜花起早，誠然歟？但不知愛彼何如？」英曰：「愛其清香嫩素也。」生曰：「清香嫩素，子但知人愛花嬌雅溫柔，獨不見花亦愛人乎？」英曰：「花無情，何能愛人？」生曰：「萬一有情者愛之，我子以為何如？英微笑不答，盒花而去。
　　明早，復會英於亭前。英曰：「官人亦欲此耶？」生曰：「欲則欲矣，恨未一攀。」英曰：「盆花滿亭，任採何害。」生曰：「此花貴麗，不能自折，必欲仗人引手耳。」英即連摘數朵與生，曰：「蕊瓣整潔，君試取之。」生佯受花，因把英手曰：「子，敏人也，猶不悟耶？」即出碧玉環一雙，跪而進曰：「久懷鄙私，未獲一展，吾子若許，方敢畢陳。」英扶起曰：「既有高明，任言無隱。」生乃從容語曰：「予自家干謁，蒙尊主款留，幸矣。但意不在索居也，實因牆外睹芳容，頓起攀花之念；柳邊聆笑語，未承題葉之交。雖名節之繫，吾不敢也。第風月之懷，人皆有焉。是以晝夜彷徨，夢魂顛倒，不愧蒹葭托玉樹，必期青鸞付嬌鸞。所賴以道達維持者，吾子也。可不乘機動意，效待月之紅娘；因事進言，法遺香之淑女？萬一雲雨之債得償，縱使捐軀之報何惜，子其為我圖之。」英見生丰姿俟俏，詞氣揚逸，心亦愛之，故赧色目生而言曰：「先生將希聖希賢，何忍謀及乃事？娘子素冰清玉潔，豈容干彼以私？人謀固當忠，天理實難泯，吾不敢也。然而自古佳期雅會，多諧於月夕花朝，況今女貌郎才，或出於天授人與，敢不委曲引君歸洛浦、周旋扶汝至陽台乎？所賜之物，義不敢領。」生強納諸袖中而去。自喜事遂一二，歸賦一律，以自慶焉：
　　天台花柳暗，今喜路能通。密意傳何切，幽懷話正匆。
　　青燈空待月，紅葉未隨風。漫說鸞台遠，相逢咫尺中。
　　越數日，春英不至。生出庭前觀之，見一小鬟手持香草。生曰：「拾此何用？」鬟曰：「浸油潤髮耳。」又曰：「見春英否？」鬟曰：「不見。」生曰：「彼此一家，何為推阻？」鬟曰：「吾值新姨房，彼為鸞姐所屬，是以不見。」生曰：「新姨為誰？」鬟曰：「姓柳，名巫雲，家翁之寵妾也。邇因遠征，權為家長，鬱鬱不得志，惟吟哦以度清宵耳。」言畢，鬟去，春英適來。生語英曰：「別後心事懸懸，癡病日篤，賢姐何不出一奇謀，以活涸轍之枯魚哉！」英曰：「吾嘗為汝圖矣，但芳心玉石，何能即開？遲之歲月可也。」生曰：「予豈不諒，第勢如纍卵，信子所言是，猶輸萬里之米而救饑餓士也，事能濟乎！」英良久曰：「鸞姐知詩，不若制一詞以挑之，何如？」生曰：「善。」乃邀英至書閣中。方欲構思，見英侍立，星眸含俏，雲鬢籠情，彼此互觀，欲思交動。乃謂英曰：「詩興不來，春興先到，奈何，奈何！」即挽英就枕，英亦不辭。金蓮半起，玉體全偎，當芙蓉露滴之時，恍若夢寐中魂魄矣。生起，喜曰：「予欲建策謀人，得子發軔。既能一戰致捷，後雖有頑敵堅城，可破竹下矣。」英曰：「但恐得手之日，不記發軔之人耳。」生曰：「如有此心，神明共殛。」將行，索詞。生一揮而就，乃《憶秦娥》也：
　　相逢後，月暗簫聲人病酒。人病酒，一種風流，甚時消受無聊獨立青青柳，恍然邂逅原非偶。原非偶，覓個良宵，丁香解扣。
　　英度來久，急忙趨回，所索之詞，竟遺於路。不意為小鬟所見，拾送巫云。雲拆視之，曰：「此情詞也，嬌鸞有外遇矣。執而白之渠母，免玷王氏風，可乎？」復自忖曰：「彼母窘我，我亦無賴，又何苦自作怨？況聞吳公子瀟灑聰明，愈於王老十倍，不若詐鸞詞以先接之。」遂作《好事近》詞以付，云：
　　好夢久飄遙，一柬將人輕撩。
　　准擬月兒高，莫把幽期負了。
　　曲房深幕護絞綃，留待多情到。
　　此際慇懃報道：要輕輕悄悄。
　　生方倚檻看花，忽見小鬟報曰：「鸞姐有書，約公子一會。」生曰：「春英何在？」鬟曰：「侍老夫人，無暇。且鸞姐害羞，夜不設火。公子如約，竟過集芳亭，越小門，達太和堂，越迎暉軒，由左而旋，即鸞寢所。慎毋誤也。」生得詞，喜溢顏色，恨不得揮太陽歸咸池，揭清光於石室。
　　少頃，遠寺鐘聲，孤村燈影，一家人寂，滿樹鴉寧。生整衣冠，循路而入。正疑左右兩道，小鬟已執香待矣。引至閨中，別一洞房，雖無燈燭之光，而月映紗窗，人物可辨。彼方巧妝豔服，瑩彩襲人。生進揖曰：「佳詞下賜，厚愛何當！極慕深思，頓令盡釋。」雲亦答禮曰：「久沽待價，擬棄於時，辱翰鍾情，恍愧慚自獻。」言畢，生抱曰：「今服何不素耶？」答曰：「幸接新郎，固宜易服。」生於此時，興不能遏，乃為之解衣，並枕而臥。但見：酥胸緊貼，柳腰款款春濃；玉臉斜偎，檀口輕輕津送。雖戲水鴛鴦，穿花蝴蝶，未足以形容也。彼此多情，不覺漏下三鼓。生因謂曰：「一自識荊桃下，幾裂肺腑，萬策千謀，今獲遂願。但不知長遠之計何出耳！」巫因答曰：「妾非嬌鸞，主人側室巫雲也。偶得私詞，不欲汝敗，因而情動，以致蠅疵。況容貌雖殊，恩義則一，百年交好，今夕殆與君訂矣。何必他顧，以自苦耶？」生得語，默忖曰：「承主不拒，受惠良多，意屬孀居，反淫愛妾，心雖不安，而悔無及矣。」雲見生不答，復又慰曰：「嬌鸞不足異，其妹嬌鳳，學繡於予，眉秀而長，眼光而潤，不施朱粉，紅白自然，飄逸若風動海棠，圓活如露旋荷蓋。且又工詩善弈，嘗為回文歌，聽者不自知其心怡神迥也，愛作懶鴉鬢，嫋娜輕盈，甚是可目。今方十六，情事想漸識矣。意或鄙妾，當與君圖之，何如？」生曰：「自知愚拙，得遇仙姬，恨無以報雅愛，敢望吹噓也。」雲曰：「君果厚妾，妾亦當厚君。必不以此介意。」言語間，窗外雞唱。生求再會，雲曰：「願得情長，不在取色。」生曰：「亦非貪淫，但無此不足以顯真愛耳。」陽台重赴，愈覺情濃，如此歡娛，肯嫌更永。事畢，口占一律以謝雲，曰：
　　巫山十二握春雲，喜得芳情枕上分。
　　帶笑漫吹窗下火，含羞輕解月中裙。
　　嬌聲默默情偏厚，弱態遲遲意欲醺。
　　一刻千金真望外，風流反自愧東君。
　　雲亦答以復生，曰：
　　浪說佳期自古難，如何一見即成歡。
　　情濃始信魚游水，意密方知鳳得鸞。
　　自訝更深孤影怯，不期春重兩眉攢。
　　願君常是心如一，莫使幽閨翠鬢寒。
　　詩成，披衣而散。
　　那嬌鸞自月夜聞琴之後，一點芳心為生所鼓，但無隙之可乘耳。春英自愧失詞，久不與生會；而生亦聞巫雲之言，思鸞之心淺矣。雲在鳳前，每每贊生。
　　一日，鳳持素枕面，托雲描花。雲曰：「吳公子博藝多才，丹青尤最，不若求彼一繪，豈不勝予哉？」鳳曰：「吳公子外人，倘求不雅。」雲曰：「彼父與家君至契，以理論之，兄妹間何避嫌為！」即呼鬟召生，生即往見。鳳與雲方並體而立，見生至，即掩雲背。生進揖，從容且恭，因而睨視。果然眉清眼媚、體秀容嬌。誠婉若游龍，飄似驚鴻也；展轉間，進退無主，景態萬千，不能盡述，惟翠枝振振而已。雲曰：「屈君無事，鳳姐有二枕面，敢勞公子一揮灑耳。」生曰：「承命宜遵，但拙筆不足以當雅視。」鳳微哂，欲言自止。生即按几運思，唾手而就。一描拳石水仙花，一描並頭金蓮花。意猶未足，又各題一絕於旁云：
　　素質天成分外奇，臨風嫋娜影遲遲。
　　衾孤寂寞情無限，一種幽香付與誰？　
　　翠蓋紅衣水上芳，同心並蒂意何長。
　　多情莫道年來瑞，還是風流學洞房。
　　寫完，呈上。鳳不覺大喜而去。雲曰：「兩日候君，何不一顧耶？」生曰：「無小鬟，恐為他人所遇，故不敢耳。」雲曰：「今幸嬌鳳先去，可坐此一語。」即命小鬟候門，具酒與生對酌。問曰：「向聞卿言，意為過譽。今閱之，卿言猶未盡也。天地生物之巧，何盡鍾於此女耶！使我心膽不能自制，將若之何？」雲曰：「非我贊襄，焉識天台之路？」生乘灑興，即抱雲曰：「卿德如山，涓埃無效。當以此心，銘之沒齒。」即插手雲懷，潛解雲帶。雲亦情動，與生入帳，共效鸞鳳，綢繆綣戀之際，恨前情猶未罄也。雲起，謂生曰：「嬌鳳讀書知禮，不可苟動。彼婢秋蟾者，亦頗通文。鳳之情性，蟾素諳識，誠能以計得之，鳳可不日取矣。」生曰：「予固愚疏，惟卿指示。」乃相與執手而別。
　　生方及門，見一女童持盒至前，口稱：「鳳姐奉謝，望公子笑留。」生開視之，乃牙扇一柄，九龍香百枚，生急問曰：「子非秋蟾姐乎？」對曰：「公子何識？」生曰：「久慕芳名，嘗懸念慮。」將近身敘話，蟾即害羞別去。生因自悔，作《望江南》詞以道之：春夢斷，心事仗誰憐？寂寂歸來情未遣。小窗幸接新緣厚，貺自天傳。----鬟翠展，相與欲留連。恍隨鶯燕忙飛遠。望斷紅塵重悵然，徒使旅魂牽。
　　越兩日，生獨坐凝思：「著意者失意，無情者有情。」正唏噓間，聞啟戶聲，視之，乃秋蟾也。生曰：「昨有柬寄答鳳姐，子竟不將去。今復來，殆非忍心者。」因命坐。蟾辭曰：「前日承畫枕面，早檢妝奩，不料為畫眉燈燼所穢，自欲描補，筆法不類公子。鳳姐知之，必笞撻矣，故特奔求，幸賜垂憐。」生即承命描焉。至畢，問曰：「將何潤筆？」蟾曰：「謝在後耳。」生曰：「筆還未盡，欲子發興，何云後乎？」即抱蟾於榻。蟾力掙不能脫，意欲出聲，恐兩有所累，自度難免，不得已，從之。生試狎之，宛然一處子也，交會中甚有不勝狀。生亦小心護持，不使情縱，得趣而已。將起，不覺猩紅滿衣，髮鬢俱亂。生為之飾鬢，因謂曰：「巫雲與鸞、鳳，孰勝？」蟾曰：「鸞姐綽約，雲姨豐豔，鳳乃兼得，而雅逸尤過之。」生曰：「情事何如？」蟾曰：「固不可測。然昨見《惜春》詩云：無聊獨立意徘徊，記得春來春又催。幾片落花門靜掩，數聲啼鳥夢初回。微風入幕紅綃篆，細雨收階綠長苔。弱質自憐光景擲，曉窗羞試鬢中煤。觀此，則情可識矣。」生又曰：「子能挑否？」蟾曰：「異姓骨肉，何萌此心？」生曰：「世事紛紛，子尚認真耶？」蟾曰：「今患眼，頗無興，徐可圖之。生曰：「予有一方，甚驗，子肯持去否？」蟾曰：「果有效驗，何為不可。」生即錄方，並致書於前曰：
　　久荷胼朦，未伸寸悃，又蒙貺下，愧面驚心，自接芳容以來，神魂恍惚，不知其為何物也。及顧賜儀，仍益悽愴。執扇痛風流之未遂，燃香慨意氣之難投。朝暮依依，莫測所事。近聞尊眸病熱，又不暇自惜矣。顧影徘徊，猶患在體。千思萬計，敬薦一方。倘得和平，則他日清目之本，誰曰不在是哉。
　　書成，封付與蟾，兼完前枕，並持而去。
　　嬌鳳素愛生才，今得書，亦不甚怪，且醫方治之，疾果愈。時暮春景候，幽禽亂呼，舞蝶相逐，生無聊，欲趨會巫雲，以話得秋蟾事。道經迎翠軒，得一金鳳釵，制極工巧可愛。生喜，取而藏之。及至雲所，雲已不在。復回故道，而鳳與蟾方咄咄相視。生趨揖，曰：「目患方除，今又竭功耶？」鳳未及答，蟾在旁應曰：「承方致愈，幸已涵明。早失一釵，來此尋覓。」生曰：「何以失之？」鳳曰：「無心而失之。」生曰：「失雖無心，得者有緣。」鳳曰：「棄之而已。」生曰：「金質鳳名，何忍相棄？」鳳曰：「縱不忍，奈無覓何。」生曰：「心誠求之，天下未有求而不得者矣。」鳳怒蟾曰：「汝在我後，眇不一看，安用汝為！」生出釵，曰：「僕久蓄此，毋怒蟾矣。」鳳接，笑曰：「舊物耳，兄何欺？」生曰：「繡閨書室，若隔天淵，而失釵竟入僕手，不可謂無緣也。敢雲欺乎？」語未竟，報：「鸞娘來。」生即趨出，謾成一詞：
　　訪舊歸來嗟不遇，轉過迎暉，又與新人語。數句情言微自露，嬌娥可是猶難悟。拾得金釵原有主，笑接慇懃，好把雲鬢護。雖得相逢游洛浦，反教添我相思慕。（《蝶戀花》）　　
　　日晚，仍赴雲處。小鬢曰：「被酒睡矣。」生揭帳視之，但見桃花映面，綠鬢欹煙，困思朦朧，雖畫工不能模寫也。生即解衣潛入衾內。雲從夢寐中作嬌聲曰：「多情郎，乃為穿窬行耶？」生曰：「本入幕賓，何得相訝。」興止而罷。生曰：「卿知秋蟾事乎？」雲曰：「雖不知，試觀其言，似與君相洽者。」生曰：「何以見之？」雲曰：「還釵賜藥，鳳曾道來。」生曰：「然則感予否？」雲曰：「縱彼不感，兄當從此機會。」生深然之，天曙而出。
　　一日清明，夫人代王祭掃，舉家隨行。鳳以處女，得不與焉。生知其然，直抵其寢室。鳳見生，驚曰：「讀書不知內外，所讀何事？」生曰：「客居寂寥，訪景怡情，迤邐而來，不覺至此。」秋蟾從旁贊曰：「早是親雅，不然，取侮多矣。」生俯立鞠躬，莫敢進退。鳳亦平顏，曰：「姑舍是，後宜慎之。然既來，理不當空返。」乃勸生坐。但見畫牀錦幕，香氣襲人，室雖不甚幽，廣雅則若仙境，可愛也。正欲遍觀，見几上有《烈女傳》一帙。生因指曰：「此書不若《西廂》可人。」鳳曰：「《西廂》，邪曲耳。」生曰：「《嬌紅傳》何如？」鳳曰：「能壞心術。且二子人品，不足於人久矣，況顧慕之耶！」生曰：「崔氏才名，膾炙人口。嬌紅節義，至今凜然。雖其始遇以情，而盤錯艱難間，卒以義終其身，正婦人而丈夫也，何可輕訾。較之昭君偶虜，卓氏當壚，西子敗國忘家，則其人品之高下，二子又何如哉？」鳳亦語塞。
　　頃之，蟾捧茶至，因謂生曰：「公子識此味否？」生曰：「嫩綠旗槍，天池一種，味雖美，恨不能一飽嘗耳。」鳳曰：「兄果欲，當奉少許，以助清趣。」生即拜曰：「若蒙俯愛，願粉身以謝。」鳳艴然曰：「兄病心乎？何語之顛倒也。」生曰：「旅館蕭條，幽懷苦逼，昏昏卒夢，百事不復措情。卿忝兄妹之交，意宜憐惜，反過責耶？」鳳又曰：「然則兄思歸乎？」生曰：「攜囊負芨，興何匆匆也。一旦夙望投空，躊躇行止，正昔人所謂要歸歸不得者矣。」鳳曰：「何不倩一排遣？」生曰：「知心在眼，欲倩久矣，其如不肯垂情耶！」鳳稍意會，不辭而去。生因趨出，吟絕句二首以自歎：
　　池平窗靜獨歸時，一見嬌娥心自癡。
　　情深不堪回首處，倚欄空賦斷腸詩。
　　乳燕飛飛鶯亂啼，滿腔心事被人迷。
　　琴堂軫冷知音少，無限芳情帶草萋。
　　越數日，春英來園中。生招謂曰：「別後耿耿，子忍不一顧耶？」英曰：「予心亦然，但嬌娘子常有恙，難相離耳。」生曰：「向承許，杳不效力，豈為信人？」英曰：「公子將別望，敢相強乎。」生笑曰：「知心有幾？」反顧間，秋蟾、小鬟亦至。生曰：「不約而俱，良會也，安可虛負。試鬥草一樂，劣者任勝者罰，何如？」眾美皆曰：「可。」時有翠色花一種，生先得之。秋蟾潛欲分之，英亦求惠，生方欲與，不料為小鬟所見，並力來奪。三女一男，混作一處。鸞度英來，又諒必遇生，忌有所私，親往伺察。鸞已近身也，春、秋猶爭笑自若。鸞叱曰：「男女不相授受，而顧狎戲如此，體面何在！」眾皆遁去，惟春英伏地請罪。鸞欲責譴，哀求而止。
　　後兩日，英忿鸞之辱己也，乃盜鸞《如夢令》詞及紅鳳頭鞋一隻與生，曰：「此嬌娘子手制，當為公子作媒。」生覽之，大喜過望。候晚，密趨臥雲軒。見鸞獨立凝神，口誦「不如意事常八九」之句，生即在背接曰：「何意不如？僕當解分一二。」鸞驚問曰：「汝來此何干？」生曰：「來赴約耳。」鸞曰：「有何約可赴？」生出鞋，曰：「此物卿既與之，今復悔耶？」鸞愕然，曰：「此必春英所竊，兄何見欺？」生曰：「然則『與君分半』之詞，亦春英所作乎？」鸞不覺面色微紅，低首不答，指捻裙帶而已。生復附耳曰：「白玉久沉，青春難再，事已至此，守尚何為？」即挽鸞頸，就大理石牀上羅裙半卸，繡履就挑，眼朦朧而纖手牢鉤，腰閃爍而靈犀緊輳。在鸞久疏舊欲，覺芳興之甚濃；在生幸接新目，識春懷之正熾。是以玉容無主，任教踏碎花香；弱體難禁，拼取翻殘桃浪，真天地間之一大快也。生喜鸞多趣有情，乃於枕上構一詞以慶之，名《惜春飛》：
　　蝶怨蜂愁迷不醒，分得枕邊春興。
　　何用鞋憑證，風流一刻皆前定。
　　寄語多情須細聽，早辦通宵歡慶。
　　還把新弦整，莫使妝台負明鏡。
　　鸞起曰：「通宵之樂，實妾本心，第礙春英耳。」生紿曰：「不妨，當並取之，以塞其口。」彼此正興逸，遙見火光，望之，乃夫人也。鸞即使生逾窗而避之，鞋與詞俱不及與。生且懼且行，不意小鬟在路，承命邀生生不能卻。至，則巫雲方守燈以待。見生面色蕭然，親以手酌生，坐生膝上，每酌，則各飲其半，不料袖中鸞鞋為彼覺而搜之，生亦不能力拒，竟留宿焉。但生雖在雲房，而一念遑遑，實屬於鳳。於是詐言早起就外，欲至鳳所，意彼尚寢，當約秋蟾為援，以情強之。
　　誰知鳳以宿妝起矣：雲鬟半斂，夢態遲遲，何啻睡未足之海棠，霧初回之楊柳；獨倚窗欄，看喜鵲爭巢而舞。見生，問曰：「舉家尚在夢中，兄何起之早耶？」生曰：「孤幃清淡，冷氣逼人，欲使安枕，難矣。」鳳亦淒然無語。少頃，几上小瓶插紅梅一枝，鳳竟往添水，若不禮生者。生從後撫其背，曰：「卿能惜花憔悴，獨不念人斷腸乎？」鳳曰：「人自腸斷，於我何與？」生作意又問曰：「向有小柬，托秋蟾奉謝，不識曾賜覽否？」鳳亦作意答曰：「雖有華章，但意思深長，語多不解，今亦置矣。」生曰：「卿既不屑一觀，當擲下還。」鳳笑曰：「恐還則又送人也。」生曰：「身萍浮梗，見棄於人久矣，尚有誰送？」鳳曰：「新姨每每致愛，何謂無人？」生曰：「果有之，但十巫雲不足以易一卿耳。」鳳又曰：「得隴望蜀，兄何不知足耶。」生曰：「噫！卿猶不諒，無怪其視我恝然也。蓋欲取虞，不得不先取虢。至以靈台一點，惟卿是圖，刺骨穿心，不能少釋，予豈分情博愛者比哉。」鳳見生言詞懇切，頗亦感動，睨視生移時。而秋蟾報：「夫人呼鳳問事。」即與偕去。在亦出外，怏怏不能披卷。及夜，賦五言律云：
　　話別幽窗下，情深思亦深。
　　佳期憑素枕，鄉夢戀重衾。
　　自信人如玉，何妨釵與金。
　　莫憐空鳳侶，還擬再論心。
　　鸞自通生後，忌春英眼，每降節下之，欲得其歡心。一日，英持玉丁香待妝，失手墮地，竟損一角。鸞收匿而不問。英因德鸞，乃扣啟曰：「侍奉閨幃，久蒙恩育，倘有所使，當竭力以圖報。」鸞曰：「我無他，惟汝玉一節，兩難周旋耳。」英曰：「夫人性寬，即在所略，則下此俱不足畏。況娘子情人，即我情人也，何自生嫌疑？」鸞曰：「汝既有美心，能引我一見乎？」英曰：「不難。」即與鸞同至生室，相見欣然。因以眼撥生，曰：「那人已回心，今夜可作通宵計矣。」生點首是之。正笑語間，忽索前鞋及詞，已無覓矣。生遮以別言，鸞疑其執。生不得已，遂以實告。鸞重有不平意，少坐而去。
　　生雖喜得鸞，而以鳳方之，則彼重於此多矣。是夜，因鳳事未諧，鬱鬱不樂，伏枕而眠，不赴鸞之約。鸞久候不至，意為巫雲所邀，乃怨雲奪己之愛。欲謀相傾。然所恨在彼，而所惜在此，又不敢忄幸　然自訣也。寢不能安，作《一叢花》詞以寫其意：
　　曉來密約小亭中，戚戚兩情濃。良宵挨盡心如痛，徒使我、望眼成空。紅葉無憑，綠窗虛扃，何處覓飛鴻？　
　　欲眠猶自倚薰籠，幽恨積眉峰。孤燈獨守難成夢，淒涼了、一枕殘紅。不是緣慳，非干薄倖，都為妒花風。
　　明早，鸞以此詞命春英特送與生。生接覽之，自悔無及，即同英入謝罪。過太和堂，望見鳳立麗春館下，看金魚戲水。生使英先回，竟趨赴鳳。鳳問秋蟾曰：「一雌前行，眾雄隨後，何相逼之甚耶？」生曰：「天下事，非相逼，焉能有成？」鳳整容施禮，而生已當胸緊抱，曰：「今日乃入手耶！」鳳怒曰：「兄何太狂！人見則彼此名損多矣！」生曰：「為卿死且不吝，何名之有？」鳳因且拒且走，生恐傷彼力，尋亦放手，但隨之而行，直至閨中。鳳即坐而舒氣，生蹲踞而前，曰：「子誠鐵石人耶。自拜丰姿，即勞夢寐，屢為吐露，不獲垂憐，使我空池虛館中，當月朗燈殘之候，度刻如年，形影相弔，將欲思歸，則香扇猶在目也，情柬猶未還也，何忍一旦自棄。及至姑留，又以熱心而對冷眼，甚不能堪。是以千回萬轉，食減容消，若癡醉沉昏然者，無非卿使之也。卿縱欲為彭蛾德耀之行，何卿送人至此極乎！」言訖，不覺淚下。鳳持生起，曰：「妾非草木，豈謂無情，方寸中被兄索亂久矣。然終不顯然就兄者，誠以私奔竊取，終非美滿之福，只自招人議耳。況觀兄之才學，必不久臥池中者，故父母亦愛兄敬兄。苟或事遂牽紅，則偕老終身，妾願足矣。計不出此，而徒依依吾前，何不諒之甚耶！」生曰：「卿言誠是，但世情易變，後會難期，能保其事之必諧乎？倘或天不從人，則萬斛相思，頓成一夢，必難復牽子襟以自訴矣，悔恨又當何如！」鳳又曰：「汝我情緣，甚非易得。此身既許於君，死生隨之，復肯流落他人手哉！」即脫指上玉記事一枚、繫青絲髮一縷與生，曰：「兄當以結髮為圖，以苟合為戒。」生袖中偶有鴛鴦荷包，亦與鳳，曰：「情聯意絆，百歲相思。」正話間，秋蟾馳至，頗知此情，乃曰：「彼此歃盟，不可無證。兄姻緣得意，妾亦有所托者。」即折髻上玉簪，以半與生，祝曰：「君情若堅」；以半與鳳，祝曰：「姐志若白。綠鬢與交，蒼頭無影。」生、鳳笑而收之。生感鳳意，口占《清夜》詞一闋云：
　　蘭房兮春曉，玉人起兮纖腰小。誓固兮盟牢，黃河長兮泰山老。鶯愁兮蝶困，綠陰陰兮紅　。密約兮雖都苦，沉夢兮難醒。
　　鳳亦以詞答生，詞名《點絳唇》：
　　默步庭闌，無端又被狂郎見。排鶯狎燕，頓使酥胸顫。訂說盟言，半怯桃花面。情洽處，且休留戀，早中金屏箭。
　　生回間，鸞見，挽生手，同至寢所，恣行歡謔。枕席中所講會者，千態萬狀，雖巫雲輩，遠拜其下風矣。事闌，日已西向。鸞起，挽生而坐，自含五和香，以舌舐生口中；或使生吸茶，又自接唇而飲。之情，實未有如鸞之極者也。是夜，復留生。生頗倦，婉辭而出。鸞疑有他就，終不快於巫云。
　　生自說盟之後，雖常會鳳，或攜手，或聯肩，或笑狎賡歌，或花月下對膝以話心事，無所不至，但語一及淫，則正色曰：「妾豈淫蕩者耶？妾果淫蕩，兄何亦貴於妾！」每每不能相強而罷。一日，房前新荷盛開，謂生曰：「出污而婷婷不染，垂實而顆顆含香，真所謂花之君子也。」生曰：「凌波仙子，香色俱傾人矣。然當嬌紅嫩綠時不趁一賞，則秋風剝落，雖欲見，得乎？」又一日，與生並坐，秋蟾忽持新蛾來，兩尾相連，四翅綽約。因謂鳳曰：「物類鍾情，卿何固執？」鳳擲蛾不語。生亦愀然曰：「大丈夫欲為一蛾不可得，虛生何為！」語雖感傷，而鳳終堅守。
　　是夜歸館，適月朗風清，因作詩以自怨云：
　　相逢不若未相逢，贏得心牽意亦忡。
　　獨立小欄憑往事，汪汪兩淚泣西風。
　　當初邂逅望成歡，今日誰知恩意難。
　　鏡裡好花溪映月，不能入手即能看。
　　佳期不偶惜芳年，設盡盟言也枉然。
　　情重幾回心欲裂，青燈夜雨夢魂顛。
　　著意尋花花正酣，相思兩字用心探。
　　傷情無奈惶惶處，一嗅餘香死亦甘。
　　吟一句，嗟歎一聲，不覺以悶鬱之懷，感風露之氣，二鼓就寢，寒熱迭攻。明旦，不能起。館童言於夫人，夫人命求湯藥以治之。然生素脫灑，今患此，心益躁則病益劇，留連三五日，猶勿藥也。巫雲、嬌鸞俱遣人問候，惟鳳若不知者。正憶忖間，秋蟾在目，且持蠟丸一枚奉生，曰：「鳳姐多致意。」生曰：「吾病不在丸，子必知之。當復鳳，如不棄盟，時來一顧，九泉無憾矣。」蟾欲回，見几上所存詩稿，並拾以報鳳。
　　鳳得凶信，又味詩詞，情意飄蕩，心甚憂之。傍晚，密與蟾親往問其疾。見生，執其手曰：「兄達人，何不幸罹此？」生曰：「一臥難起，自謂不得復睹芳容，此亦孽緣所羈，不自悔也。但夙願未酬，使我飲恨泉下，卿亦獨能恝然乎？」語未終，淚隨言下。鳳亦帶淚謂生曰：「妾身不毀，則良會可期，兄宜自愛。」親出紅帕，與生拭淚。見生面冷，又自以面溫之。臨別時，依依不能捨。乃解綃金束腰與生，曰：「留此伴兄，勝妾親在枕也。」含淚而去，且顧且行。
　　生雖未得通鳳，然而脂香粉色，殆領會盡矣。況其意念　　，生亦感釋，病為之少差。生匿不聞，欲恐鳳再至。越日，果來。近牀問曰：「兩日頗快否？」生曰：「癡病懨懨，未知此身孰有，敢望快乎！萬一復理巾櫛，當索快於吾卿，不識周旋之意何如耳。」鳳欲寬生，乃曰：「恭喜後，惟兄是從。敢執前見以負罪耶？」生不勝喜，病亦漸愈。
　　初起，即往候鳳。鳳見生，喜愛過於平日，因謂生曰：「兄在患時，妾心膽幾裂，夜不解衣者數晚。憂兄之情，行止坐臥不釋也。今幸無恙，綿遠之期可卜矣。」因出詞以示生：
　　緣乖分薄，平地風波惡。得意人而疾作，兩處一般耽擱。
　　書齋相問痛淚魂，孤衾拼與溫存。忍別歸來心戚，一線紅泉偷滴。（右調《青玉案》）　　
　　生亦出詞，乃謝鳳者也，詞名《南鄉子》：
　　病起識紅塵，患難方知益故人。按扣含嬌輕解處，情真：一枕酥香分外親。----報德愧無因，惹我相思恨轉新。骨瘦不堪情事重，傷春，綠暗紅稀再問津。
　　彼此看訖，情話綢繆。生不覺興動，欲求鳳會。鳳不允，生曰：「卿言在耳，今又背之，守信者當不如是也。」鳳曰：「妾非爽信，但兄新愈，當迷雲溺雨之時，能保其情之不少縱乎！倘有不虞，雖曰愛兄，實害兄矣。妾忍見耶？」生聞鳳言，歷歷可聽，亦不甚強之。
　　又越兩日，生意無聊，本欲會鸞一敘，然意重情堅，不覺足為心使，沉吟之間，寂至鳳室。以指擊門，不應。生怒，排窗而入。鳳方在圍屏中擁爐背燈而浴，見生至，嬌羞無措，即吹滅燈。生從黑中抱住，曰：「正欲情勝，何相拒耶？」又以手摸其乳，小巧瑩柔，軟溫香膩，雖寒玉酥雞豆肉，不足以喻其妙也。因逼之就枕。鳳度不可解，因誑生曰：「夙世姻緣，今夜必償兄矣。所慮者，兄花柳多情耳，萬一拋人中道，使妾將何所歸？必當對天證誓，然後就枕未晚也。」生以為然，乃曰：「此素願耳，何難之有。」即舍鳳自誓。鳳徐理衣，詐呼：「秋蟾覓火！」竟從小門遁去。燈至，誓完，而鳳已去久矣。生彷徨悵望。不能為情。秋蟾為生新愈，恐復激恙，因慰之曰：「鳳姐裸裎燈下，是以害羞，然心實未嘗昧也。公子無欲速，則好事何患不成？今妾欲留公子，恐得罪鳳姐，未敢也。不若游至新妙姨處一遣，何如？」及至，雲已睡熟，不能進矣。急辭蟾投鸞，鸞尚未寢。見生悶悶不言，問之亦不答，鸞又促膝近生，曰：「對知心人不吐露心曲，何也？」生難以實告，詐應之曰：「才夢見楊太真試浴，正戲狎間，為風竹所醒，不得成歡。然而情狀態度，猶隱隱在腔子中，所以戀戀不已若此也。」鸞曰：「果鬱此乎？妾雖不及太真，情則一也，即當與兄同浴，以解此懷。」乃命春英具湯，設屏秉燭，各解其衣，挽手而浴。生雖負悶，然當此景，情豈不動？即抱鸞於膝，欲求坐會。鸞亦任生所為。燈影中殘妝弱態，香乳纖腰，粉頸朱唇，雙灣雪股，事事物物，無非快人意者。生於此時，不魂迷而魄揚也哉！浴畢，即攜手共枕，戲謔無所不至，而情事未可以言語形容也。
　　生早起就外，思鳳之念猶未釋然。乃畫美女試浴圖，寫詩於上，以道忿怨之意：
　　燈前偷見一嬌娥，試浴含羞脫綺羅。
　　怯露芙蓉新映水，舒香荷芰嘯凌波。
　　雲迷弱質歡情杳，月暗殘妝夢想多。
　　舊日相思合愈渴，蘭湯不共待如何。
　　生方擲筆，適鳳使蟾候生起居，且曲為謝罪。生曰：「吾當面責之。」即持畫而入。鳳見生，掩口笑曰：苟非遁去，幾入虎喙。」生亦笑曰：「狗盜之謀，何足為幸。」因出所題與觀。鳳曰：「高才妙味，具見之矣。但今雖迷暗，豈無虛朗之日乎？」生曰：「卿之操志，心領已深，第中熱苦難忍耳。譬之於酒，醇醪在手，何忍弗醉，未有不取而吸之者也。譬之於花，芳葩在前，何忍望香，未有不嗅而攀之者也。苟為不然，至愚且負甚矣。人將不重嗤之耶！今卿具醇醪之美，芳葩之嬌，而僕又非愚而負者，此其所以欲一吸且攀也，何自蹈守株緣木之行，徒作其人也哉！」鳳曰：「妾非忍心，慮在遠耳。兄知酒矣，獨不知一潑不能收耶？兄知花矣，獨不知一開不能蕊耶？兄固非薄倖者流，妾實念及於此，若徒逞目前之欲，則合巹時將何以為質耶？是以今日之守，亦為兄守耳，兄何不諒之甚。」生曰：「是則是矣，吾恐媒妁未偕，歸期在邇，一會且未知何日也，何合巹之可望乎！」　
　　生言愈懇，鳳不能當，即抱生於懷內，曰：「兄何鍾情之極！」生亦捧鳳面，曰：「向使病骨不起，則國色天香又入他人手，而溫存款曲之情今將與卿永絕矣，此情安能不鍾也。」鳳又頓足起，曰：「芳盟在邇，豈敢昧心。萬一事不可料，有死而已，不忍憐香惜粉以負兄也。兄何出此言哉。」生不得已，乃難鳳曰：「適呈拙題，敢請一和。以刻香半寸為則。香至詩成，永甘卿議。不然，雖翅於天，鱗與淵，亦將與子隨之。心肯灰冷耶？」生料鳳雖聰慧，未必如此敏也。不意得命即成，無勞思索。
　　夜靜人闌浴素娥，曲憑深處解香羅；
　　偷看舞燕衝紅雨，戲逐輕鴛起綠波。
　　意重不妨言意淡，情真何用講情多；
　　紅泉一點應難與，無奈東君欲速何。
　　香未至而詩先就。生亦無如之何，乃仰天歎曰：「大丈夫死只死矣，何向兒女子口中取氣耶。」即拂袖而出，生雖不得志，然亦直鳳之言，高鳳之節，未嘗不私。自歎賞，而愛慕之心，益加切矣。
　　自是生久居鸞處，將及旬餘，絕不與鳳一面。巫雲間或會焉；鳳則常使人問候。殆無虛日，時四月二十三。夫人度辰，召宴親戚於忠列堂。生亦在焉，內則巫雲輩五六人。外則叔姪輩六七人，垂簾為蔽，優樂盡歌舞之美，水陸極龍鳳之珍，聒耳充目，無非富麗者也。內有褚晴岩者，夫人姪也，亦事舉子業，與生話甚投，因對奕賭酒，生棋雖優，然心眼常在簾內，連負三局，罰酒六大杯，鳳恐致醉，密使小鬟。祝生罷，奕生方收局。褚復逼生投壺，手雖把箭，而心愈屬鳳，故矢皆落地。又得酒四大觥，而生漸醉矣。鳳見生言揚，恐失禮於人，急揀王所合乾葛丸，貽生嚼之三咽後，清爽如故。生得不及亂者，鳳之力也。席罷夫人先寢，事托巫云為理。家人俱散，時近二更。生知無礙，即直造鳳所。鳳方坐牀，脫繡，見生至。且驚且喜曰：「兄久忙，何暇至此？」生曰：「被斥之人，無顏求見，今蒙不醉之德，故來謝耳。」鳳曰：「果非妾，兄將不勝甚矣。」生移身近鳳曰：「麴檗所釀，不過醉面，至於情意所絆，安能醉心。僕因卿醉，心甚矣，顧乃吝不一醒何耶？」鳳曰：「兄果執迷，必欲以情事相尚，則秋蟾愛婢也亦頗俊豔，以代妾，何如？」生曰：「卿誤矣，燕石滿囊。不若粒玉之能寶，駘蹄盈廄何如，一驥之可良，病入膏肓，心力俱困。若曰妾代如蟾者，雖得不死於卿前，形影孑孑，如窮鱗無翼之所歸，意在卿也。豈愛婢哉。」鳳意稍解，但默默不言。生又進曰：「天下有強奴悍冠始，雖甚惡之。及其輸情納罕，匍匐祈哀之時，未嘗不屈法憐宥。然則僕之於卿，亦可謂舒甚矣。而卿竟不少憐，豈奴冠之不若乎。」鳳見生言墾墾，乃曰：「兄意既如此，妾敢固愛，但姑待明夜可也。」生興正發，即抱住曰：「僕勝頗短，不能優游以待，且人定回天，何況於子。」乃力推僕枕。鳳亦不敢相卻，任生解衣。翡翠衾中，輕試海棠新血，死央枕上謾飄桂蕊音香。情濃任教織襪之縱橫，興逸哪管雲鬟之撩亂。生愛鳳嬌，帶笑徐徐；鳳憐生病，含羞怯怯。肺腑情傾細舌，不由我香汗沾胸；絞綃春染紅妝，難禁他嬌聲聒耳。從今快夢想之懷，自是償姻緣之債矣。是夜，生為情慾所迷，將五鼓才睡。當旭日紅窗，而生鳳猶交頸自若。秋蟾恐懼人來，乃揭幔低聲曰：「陽台夢尚未醒耶？」生、鳳乃驚覺，整衣而起。鳳急飾妝，嬌姿愈豔。生在旁大喜狂溢，乃綴《樂春風》一詞以慶之：
　　錦褥香棲，幽閨春鎖。幾番神思蓬瀛，今得身游夢所。風流何處值錢多。蘭蕙舒芬芳，桃榴破顆。嬌羞嫋娜，情重處，玉堂金穀皆左。才識得，一刻千金價果。
　　鳳觀畢，曰：「妾之薄柳，不避淫污，一旦因兄致玷，誠以終身付之也。若曰暮暮朝朝，甚非所願。惟兄諒之，則萬幸矣。」亦口綴前詞以復焉：
　　鸞鏡才圓，鵲橋初渡。暗思昨夜風光，羞展輕蓮小步。杏花天外玉人酡，難禁眉攢，又何妨鬢白。情諧意固，管什麼，褪粉殘紅無數。須常記，一刻千金價果。
　　是夜，嬌鸞席散，欲得生一罄酒興，乃自往邀生，至則野渡無人，几窗寂寂而已。因忿生不先會己而赴巫雲，不知生在鳳處也。於是欲決意謀雲，而未得其便。一日，會台州人歸，以軍功報夫人。鸞乃重賄使，詐傳王命：「早暮衙內淒涼，可送新姨作伴。」使者得賄，果如計語夫人。夫人亦憐王在外，信而從之，即使雲去。雲患涉險，又以生故，不欲行。正躊躇間，生忽趨至，雲曰：「何來？」生曰：「聞卿被召，時決有無。」雲曰：「誠然。」生曰：「去則去矣，僕將何依？」雲曰：「一自情投，即堅仰托，正宜永好，常沐春陽，奈事不如人，頓令隔別，雖曰後會有日，而一脈心情，不得與鸞、鳳輩馳騁矣。」生曰：「事已至此，為之奈何！」乃相與執手噓唏。而夫人以明當吉日，又使小鬟促雲整妝。生夜即留宿雲所，眷戀不可悉記。
　　早起，鳳持紗衣一套，桂餅、梅丸各二封以贐。雲因謂生曰：「鳳姐與我自從奉接閨幃，情同己出，況以公子之故，敢負斯心。汝百歲良姻，此行可力任矣，善自綢繆，毋生嫌隙。但不知他日待我何如耳？」言訖淚下。鳳與生亦大慟，正惜別間，報夫人來送，生即致意而出矣。然自巫雲去後，夫人以鳳無所托，命鸞與俱家事，代雲分埋。是以人之出入，門之啟閉，親為防間，鸞欲獨任生情。今反兩不得使，心竊悔焉。生亦怏怏失意，且遭連再，蓋難為情。是夜伏枕不安，謾成詩詞各一首：
　　熱梅小雨故連宵，旅館愁來不待招。
　　筆硯病馀功課少，家鄉雲外夢魂遙。
　　簷聲逼枕添惆悵，燈影憐人伴寂寥。
　　新綠滿園雖可意，久虛尋賞任風搖。
　　香柳娘調：
　　對孤燈悄然，對孤燈悄然；夜闌人倦雨聲，滴破相思怨。這情緒可憐，這情緒可憐；展轉不成眠，懶把羅衾戀。想伊兒妙年，想伊兒妙年；腸斷心痛，務諧姻眷。
　　不料夫人勞役太過，忽臥一疾不能起，鳳方待湯藥，而鸞密使春英報生，生乃以姪禮問安。回至太和堂，散步自思曰：「此中旬日不登，風景入目頓別，不意鸞突在後，相見各喜。鸞促而行。生逡巡不敢進。」鸞曰：「老母伏牀，馀皆無慮，兄宜寬心。同行間，宛然鳳寢舊路，至則二閨緊貼，僅間一壁耳。」坐謂生曰：「向夜自走候兄，竟成不偶何也？」生曰：「想緣醉夢中，知罪！知罪！」又曰：「那人去後，頗勞兄念耶！」生曰：「相思情愛，何人無之，苟為不然，薄倖甚矣！」卿亦何取於僕，鸞不能對。乃出餅果與生並體而食。正細話間，報鳳姐請議藥方。生即告出，鸞曰：「暮夜無知，願兄著意。」生曰：「中門鎖鑰，誰則任之。」鸞曰：「自有處。」生及昏時，潛入太和堂。正欲扣門，鸞已先視英候矣。至謂鸞曰：「今何能此？」答曰：「才與鳳約，每夜輪伴老母，庶可節勞。幸吾妹如議，妾可常常而見。兄可源源而來，妾之為兄，無不盡意如此。」生不暇備談，即與就枕，時方清和，狂蕩甚過千態萬以，不能悉明。乃以足枕生股，手撫生腮曰：「觀君丰神情趣，色色可人，真大作家也，恨相見之晚！」生曰：「但得此身在，永遠可期，何晚之有！」語畢，鸞體頗倦竟熟睡。生憶春英在近，不無動情者。乃輕含鸞縈歡於英，英曰：「鸞姐性酸，不敢仰就。」生曰：「向無子，焉有今日？縱知，且不較，況在夢乎。」英感生情，即如命。交會間亦甚有趣。生雖戰後，而眷戀新人，愈發豪興。且其牡丹一朵，肥淨、瑩膩、窄淺，樣是駭人，貌固不及諸美，而此實為最勝者也。生留連不忍去，英促之，復就鸞所。鸞亦暝目不覺。東方白矣。臨行時，鸞又約曰：「後夜莫推佳會。」　
　　生至園亭，默忖「輪伴」之言，思欲與鳳一款。及晚，密啟中門，私趨內室。但見二閨杳然無人。生乃獨臥鳳牀，垂幃自蔽。候至更餘，鳳來，起幔見生，半驚半笑。生亦笑曰：「待卿久矣。」鳳曰：「正欲見兄，決一大事。」生曰：「何以教我？」鳳曰：「一自見兄，情頗難制，說盟不已，又辱私奔，雖其反己懷慚，而事原夙定，不足追也。奈此來老母染病，俗言『喜可破災』，求婚者日無停議。妾在女流，不敢自白。兄，丈夫列也，計將安圖？」生曰：「托跡門來，即承二大人俯愛，正愧一無所報，而可以此情聞乎？卿固慧人，若以己謀己，則勢便而機投，倘諧所言，勉當恪遵，雖死不避。」鳳低首蹙容，半晌不語，乃謂生曰：「此事若圖之老母，鸞姐在侍，必難允諧。為今之計，兄急索尊翁一書、聘物一二件，竟送父任。老父素喜兄，而新姨又力贊，事想八九矣。苟得父命，縱母有別議，而妾可執以為詞，豈不萬全也哉？」生喜曰：「此良策也，明當東歸，一如卿議。」鳳因命蟾備酒，自捧觴，謂生曰：「此酌一則餞別，二則永訣。蓋妾之一身既寄兄手，萬一天不從人，妾寧碎玉面沉珠，決不忍抱琵琶過別船也。此行勉旃，不可草草。縱老父未許，老母他從，變當再來一會，莫使萬種恩情竟成疏逖，則妾死無憾矣！」言畢，悲咽不勝，淚下如雨。生亦愀然泣淚，唯唯承命。是夜雖與鳳並頭交股，奈歡心為離思所拘，未及構情而雞已唱矣。鳳乃枕上成絕句二首以送生：
　　比翼初分腸斷猿，離愁欲語復吞言；
　　相思好似湖頭水，一路隨君到故園。
　　送別餘情分外濃，行行獨泛酒旗風；
　　明朝此際淒涼處，鳳枕鸞衾半截空。
　　生即辭鳳，入謝夫人，嬌鸞知之，急使春英留生。生托以「家尊有書遠召，故不敢違。多致意鸞姐，事完，當復來謁也」。鸞度不可留，乃送細果二盒、巾絹十衣為贐行之敬。
　　生抵家，備以王愛留之情、鳳永諧之意，曲道於父。父不勝喜曰：「此吾責也。」即為書及白金百兩、彩緞二端、金釵環各二事，遣人往合求婚。
　　王得書，謂巫雲曰：「吳兵部家求鳳姐親，汝為何如？」雲曰：「簪纓世冑，才茂學優，何不可之有？」王笑曰：「吾亦久蓄此意，但不欲自啟耳。今當乘其來求索，以為贅，則吾老亦有托矣。至於花燭之事，且待賊平榮歸，親自校點也。」因以聘禮送歸夫人，答書許焉。人還，生大喜如醉，因作《西江月》以自慶：
　　久待西廂明月，今方願遂隨喬。已知鸞鳳下湘瀟，何用信傳青鳥。曉苑飛花有主，春田蘊玉成瑤。雲橋再渡樂良宵，正是　娥年少。
　　生欲再往復鳳，生父止之曰：「前以客禮留連，今初聘結，不宜輕數，姑俟有便而往可也。」生鬱鬱不敢違。居家兩月，人事、書史俱不介意，參前、侍側，一鳳之外無餘思也。
　　不意巫雲自別生後，朝暮思憶，食減容消，成一鬱疾。王千方求治，毫不能愈。臨終時，進小鬟謂曰：「吾病已屬膏肓，勢在難救，然而取死之故，汝必知之。今亦不足言，但前有鞋詞，有我身且不保，留之何用！汝持歸，萬福公子：我不能再見矣，當與鳳姐永好耳。」言訖大悲，目亦尋閉。鬟急呼叫，意無濟。王乃從厚葬殮，募僧追薦，舉柩寄安國寺中。雖甚痛悼，亦無如之何矣。
　　家中夫人受聘之後，病患日減。一日，時當七夕，乞巧於庭。二嬌以夫人新食，筵極豐潔，又使英、蟾輩歌詩侑觴，而夫人終若不豫。嬌鸞請之，因答曰：「鳳事告吉，可謂得人，吾無憂矣。但汝父監軍，未乞骸骨，汝年方壯，孤節難終，懷抱間所未釋然者，猶坐此耳。汝自成歡，毋吾以也。」是夜，皆不樂而罷。
　　二嬌回房，鸞獨長歎不臥。英私問曰：「娘子彷徨，得非憶吳公子乎？」鸞不答，但首點之。英曰：「何不招之使來，徒自苦耶！」鸞曰：「招之使來，置鳳何地？」英曰：「天下莫重者父母，所難者弟兄。今娘子與鳳姐一脈所存，何不成以恩義，結以腹心，彼此忘懷共事也？」鸞曰：「然日登鳳凰之台，時處瀟湘之館，豈不快哉；顧乃各立門牆，自生成隙，此奪彼進，時憂明慮，不亦愚耶！」鸞又曰：「汝言唯良，開我蒙蔽多矣。」即相與詣鳳，曰：「我汝骨肉，猶花兩枝，本則一也。倘不見別，當以一言相告。」鳳曰：「遵命。」鸞曰：「予與吳生有不韙之愛，自擬終身以之。不料六禮先成，予亦竊幸。但今一去三月，頗煩念情。欲招之，則於妹有礙，欲舍之，則於心不忍。兩可之間，敢持以質也。」鳳憮然曰：「不敢請耳，籌之熟矣。予之得配吳君，論私恩，姐當為先，執公議，妹忝為正。心欲相較，則分薄而勢爭。不若骨肉同心，事一君子，上不貽父母之憂，下可全姊妹之愛，不出戶庭，不煩媒伐，而人倫之至樂自在矣。但願義篤情堅，益隆舊好，大小不較，無懷二心。妹之所望於姐者此耳，何必鬱鬱拘拘於形跡間哉！」鸞曰：「妹果成我，我復何憂。」即為書邀生。
　　生托以他事，赴焉。及門，夫人待之，禮加於昔。出就池館，有感風景依然，謾成一律云：
　　園亭復得啟窗扉，案積凝塵手怕揮。
　　池淨萍開魚自躍，梁空泥落燕初歸。
　　深知一遇生難再，況是三奇世所稀。
　　景色依然情事重，欄杆倚遍夕陽微。
　　是夜，二嬌度生必至，設酒以待。更初，生果入謁。鸞迎，謂曰：「新女婿來矣。」生答曰：「舊相知耳。」相笑而坐。語中道及姐妹同心事，生喜曰：「情愛之間，人所難處也。二卿秉義，娥、英不得專美矣。」然亦自慚曰：「而僭獲奇逢，謹當毋倦盟心，少酬知己，二卿其尚鑒之。」鸞、鳳皆唯唯。酒罷，生欲就鳳。鳳辭曰：「凡事讓長，妾不敢無。」生傾鸞，鸞又曰：「奉禮新人，義不可僭。」相遜者久之。生不能全，乃曰：「鸞娘不妒，鳳卿不私，既在兼成，尤當兼愛。」即以一手挽鸞，一手拍鳳肩，同入羅幃中。二嬌雖欲自制，亦挫於生興之豪而止。是枕長枕：披大被，二美一男，委婉若盤蛇，屈貼如比翼，彼此行春，來遞愛，殆不知生之為生、鸞鳳之為鸞鳳也。
　　一日，新雨初收，涼風微動。生覺寂困，乃趨鳳閨。鳳方晝臥一榻，生欲亂之，才起裙，不料鸞至。鸞即低聲撫生曰：「兄欲何為？」生曰：「刻心人阻我高興。」乃舍鳳狎鸞，推倒於榻頭，取雙蓮置之兩臂，立而獵之。興趣不能狀，情逸聲嬌，鳳竟驚覺，生復逼體私鳳，力拒不從。正持案間，鸞曰：「鳳妹獨作清客耶？」乃助生開懷，縱情大戰。事畢，鸞指生柄，曰：「期何物也？嘗能授人如是？」鳳笑曰：「堅肉。」蓋以生字「汝玉」也。生答曰：「非此不能補縫。」蓋以「鳳」字同音也。鸞大笑而起。
　　一日，夫人以生館寂寥，命遷之太和堂側，意便供值，而不知益近嬌所矣。鸞約鳳攜觴往賀，至，則生謂曰：「勝會難逢，不可獨樂，雖英、蟾亦宜侍坐。」二嬌許之。酒至半，生令其取緋色，多得者為狀頭，餘者聽調。不料生果得五緋，而鳳僅得一。乃使英執壺，蟾反觴，而鸞侑食，鳳則歌以勸生：
　　蛟起淵兮鳥出幽，紅妝侍兮綠蟻浮。人生佳會兮不常有，及早行樂兮為良謀。古人有見兮能達，不甘利祿兮優游。邀明月兮歌金縷，披清風兮醉玉樓。惟此二物兮何友，取諸一襟兮奚求？堪嗟白駒兮易過，任汝朱顏兮難留。百年兮縱然能壽，其中兮幾日無憂。所以偷閒兮及時買笑，賞心兮何惜纏頭。慇懃把盞兮願拼酩酊，豈可碌碌徒效蜉蝣。
　　歌罷，鸞曰：「今賭拳，當便宜行事，何如？」生曰：「可。第無悔。」二嬌欲難生，而勝算又為生得。秋蟾則在無算，生即抱蟾於懷，以手弄其乳；命鸞進酒，與蟾同飲，一吸酒，則一接唇，戲謔無所不至。生因大醉，眾美扶挾而寢。
　　一日，中秋後晚，鸞鳳宴生於臥雲軒之庭中。飲至二鼓，星月愈皎。生曰：「僕與卿等相與，樂則樂矣。未曾通宵。今夕頗良，不若再陳狼籍之杯盤，檢點將闌之興趣，席地而坐，互韻而歌，倦則對月長憩，醒則洗觴更酌，略分忘形，一樂可乎？」於是設重禮，鋪繡褥，用矮几置菜果，羅坐其上。時鳳履青金點翠鞋，生愛其纖巧俊約，則捧上膝頭，把玩不忍釋；又脫以盛杯流飲，笑傲戲樂，人間之所無。生興不能遏，欲求鳳會。鳳曰：「清光皓色中，何可為此？」生曰：「廣寒求此不能得，豈相妒耶。」即與鳳交於褥間。事闌，英添香，蟾斟酒，鸞自起而慶生。生曰：「姑待見瀆後同飲，何如？」遂亦狎鸞，鸞亦不避。生因得大舒醉興。然患其惠之不均也，欲次及英。英當生嬌相接時，情已飄蕩，此則任生所行，無甚難色。蟾度勢必臨己，先匿其跡。生方舍英覓蟾，已不在矣。生曰：「金湯且克，何懼蕞綿。」乃遍索之，得於槐陰中之芙蓉架邊，因笑曰：「子固苦我，今能翅耶？」不暇枕席，即與狎戲。生興固高，而酒又為助，蟾不能勝，正昏迷間，鸞、鳳、春英皆至，遂止之。生夜大醉，諸美亦被酒回房，時漏五下矣。
　　自後朝出暮入，習以為常，一鳳一鸞，更相為伴。或投壺花下，或彈棋竹間，或攜手聯賡，或連袂對酌，生之一身，日在脂粉綺羅中優游，而他不暇顧矣。因作《芳閨十勝》以自賞：
　　雲----鬟　
　　梳罷香絲擾擾蟠，笑將金鳳帶斜安。
　　玉容得汝多妝點，秀媚如云若可餐。
　　鴉色膩，雀光寒，風流偏勝枕邊看。
　　雪----股　
　　娟娟白雪絳裙籠，無限風情屈曲中。
　　曉睡起來嬌怯力，和身款款倚簾櫳。
　　水骨嫩，玉山隆，鴛鴦衾裡挽春風。
　　鳳----眼　
　　波水溶溶一點清，看花玩月特分明。
　　嫣然一段撩人處，酒後朦朧夢思盈。
　　梢帶媚，角傳情，相思幾處淚痕生。
　　蛾----眉　
　　淡月彎彎淺效顰，含情不盡亦精神。
　　低頭想是思張敞，一抹羅紋巧簇春。
　　山樣翠，柳般新，菱花鏡裡淨無塵。
　　金----蓮　
　　龍金點翠鳳為頭，襯出蓮花雙玉鉤。
　　尖小自憐行步怯，鞦韆裙裡任風流。
　　穿芳逕，上小樓，淺塵窄印任人愁。
　　玉----筍　
　　春蔥玉削美森森，袖擁香羅粉護深。
　　笑意花枝能索巧，更憐留別解牽襟。
　　機中字，弦上音，纖纖紅用漫傳心。
　　柳----腰　
　　嬌柔一捻出塵寰，端的丰標勝小蠻。
　　學得時妝宮樣細，不禁嫋娜帶圍寬。
　　低舞月，緊垂環，幾回雲雨夢中攀。
　　酥----乳　
　　脈脈雙含絳小桃，一團瑩軟醞瓊醪。
　　等閒不許春風見，玉扣紅綃束自牢。
　　溫比玉，膩如膏，醉來入手興偏豪。
　　粉----頸　
　　霜肌不染色融圓，雅媚多生蟾鬢邊。
　　鉤挽不妨香粉褪，倦來常得枕相憐。
　　嬌滴滴，嫩娟娟，每勞引望悵佳緣。
　　朱----唇　
　　胭脂染就麗紅妝，半啟猶含茉莉芳。
　　一種香甜誰識得，慇懃帳裡付情郎。
　　桃含顆，榴破房，銜杯霞影入瑤觴。
　　是月，台賊得平，且靖峒堡塞百餘處。王以功領封敕歸。至家月餘，欲與生、鳳完禮，不料奔走宴賀之事甚勞，箭瘡頓發，流血數升而死。遺命嫁鸞，夫人則托生終養。
　　鳳聞雲死，固自痛惜，今又遭喪，哀毀愈切，絕不許生一會，雖見，亦不戲一語。生重其孝，不敢相奪，時在太和堂納悶。不意小鬟自內出，見生，唱禮後即垂淚曰：「新姨自公子而亡，公子不為新姨面戚，何耶？」生曰：「子不知耳。自去經年，指望再續舊好。今忽聞變，淚從心飲，若自神知，欲求一面，無由可行，縱死以俟，戚亦難以盡我矣。」鬟憮然曰：「公子情義如此，無怪吾姨之死猶戀戀也。」生急問曰：「曾有言否？」鬟曰：「餘無囑，惟願與鳳姐永好耳。且寄紅鞋一隻、書一柬，不知何意。」生急索之，鬟曰：「在我奩中，容即奉也。」生曰：「隨取何如？」鬟曰：「可。」乃相與至巫雲舊房。但見牀几依然，箱廚積垢；及視鞋詞，事跡如昨，懷人憶古，不覺淒然。生乃流涕大慟，鬟亦對泣。
　　生徐拭淚，撫鬟曰：「我無雲姨，亦不能至此。今日不料寸報毫無，竟成永別。雲姨不可見矣，見汝猶見雲姨也，敢欲與子重締新歡，少償舊恨，陰靈有見，諒在喜全。」即欲求速，鬟曰：「主母果有意，但文鴛不足以托彩鳳耳。」生曰：「固情奪分，何傷，何傷。」鬟曰：「縱無傷，亦與二姐有礙。」生曰：「英、蟾且命自薦，何礙於子？」鬟笑而不答。生即挾至牀中，為彼脫衣解帶。相狎時，甚能承受，勇於秋蟾過多。生笑問曰：「原紅已落誰手？」鬟應聲曰：「昔時為老主所得。」生曰：「惜哉！嬌海棠何忍枯藤纏耶！」鬟亦笑曰：「枯藤朽矣，海棠又傍喬木矣。禍福難憑，世情固不測如此。」生因傷感，不得盡興而起。書館煢煢，乃作挽雲詩一章：
　　憶別依依出畫欄，誰知復見此生難。
　　湘湖月缺波痕冷，巫峽雲消山色寒。
　　繡架寂寥針線斷，妝奩零落粉脂乾。
　　燈殘酒醒猿啼絕，空向西窗淚眼漫。
　　是夜，宿於鬟處，鸞鳳寂不知也。
　　三七後，生因告歸，報父，欲舉奠祭之禮。豈期嬌叔士彪者，素流蕩險惡，溺情花酒中，家殖始與王同，因此敗落。王每諷誨，則以為輕已也，心甚銜之。王亡，舉一子求嗣，欲利所有。夫人慮其不誠，不許，且以有婚辭。彪怒，乃誣生因奸謀命，竟鳴於官。官得士彪私，將產業一半與彪，以半與夫人贍老，斷生在逃不究，二嬌則令改嫁。生聞，奈公案已成，竟不能白。士彪大喜，以嬌為他婦，則許聘締。鸞謂鳳曰：「蕭牆起變，骨肉相殘，大事去矣！將若之何？」鳳勃然曰：「難測者外來之變，能定者吾心之天。今雖挫拂間關，正明義之秋，見節之日也。妹當與姐協力同心，堅盟守禮，萬一惡叔悔悟而改，貪官罷黜以行，則臥雲之會，終為可期。苟或不能，有死而已。」鸞曰：「妹有此志，我亦竊效微末，雖不能為貞節人，免使呼為淫劣婦足矣。」言論之間，悲慘特甚，乃相與大泣。自是，朝暮依依，唯生是念。而生在家，亦惟鸞、鳳是圖，奈斷案之後，士彪嚴為關防，雖蒼頭孺子，不許私出入，恐與生有所約也。將及年餘，竟不能通一紙。生欲抱義與逞，生父又力阻之，是以兩相耽擱。二嬌居處怨慕，所自排者，惟形之於詩詞耳。有《四景閨怨》，錄於後：
　　寂寂香閨晝掩門，飛花啼鳥兩銷魂。
　　眉峰愁重應難盡，事到傷心誰與論！　
　　薔薇一架雨初收，欲候歸舟頻上樓。
　　無奈梁間雙燕子，對人事語綢繆？　
　　澆來強自試新妝，倦整金蓮看海棠。
　　不是幽人多懊惱，可憐辜負好春光。
　　開遍棠梨倚遍欄，無端瘦得帶圍寬。
　　花前賦就相思句，留與每天仔細看。
　　窗下新裁白苧衣，等閒紅瘦綠成肥。
　　遊人不是迷歌舞，飛盡楊花尚未歸。
　　風定簾垂日正遲，篆煙裊裊午眠時。
　　簟涼好夢誰驚覺，小院颯颯噪柳枝。
　　曲欄新筍漸成竿，獨對南薰憶舊歡。
　　露卻酥胸香粉濕，倩誰與我掩齊紈。
　　慚愧紅顏果薄緣，風流讓與並頭蓮。
　　蘭湯自解丁香浴，怯怯嬌姿不似前。
　　小庭梧葉乍驚風，立盡清陰盼落鴻。
　　自信別來多寂寞，一緘此生未相逢。
　　好事蹉跎一夢如，應知今日悔當初。
　　芭蕉綠滿芙蕖放，十約立誓九度虛。
　　覽鏡消容為念君，恩情何忍等秋云。
　　黃花不似愁人瘦，人比黃花瘦幾分。
　　南樓待月負良宵，楓冷江空去路遙。
　　無限淒涼蛩話徹，孤燈明滅淚痕消。
　　錦幕生寒怯翠環，天涯目斷幾雲山。
　　相思最是傷情處，野寺寒鐘香靄間。
　　老幹舒香已報春，不禁情動兩眉顰。
　　金樽未舉心先醉，惟有梅花是故人。
　　挑盡殘燈撥盡灰，芙蓉帳冷共誰偎？　
　　孤愁一段無憑著，斜倚薰籠夢幾回。
　　芳心一點玉壺冰，誰肯輕捐萬斛情。
　　攜手何時重賞雪，臥雲軒下許平生。
　　鸞見詩，謂鳳曰：「妹有是心，予獨無情乎？然詩妙矣，吾不能和，當以曲賡之。」亦成《四景題情》一套於左：
　　降都春　
　　情濃乍別，為多才，寸心千里縈結。暗想當初，背地香偷曾玉竊。如今惹下相思孽，倒不如無情安貼。滿懷愁緒，幾能夠對他分說？　
　　出隊子　
　　蘭芽長茁，又見春光早漏泄。鶯鶯燕燕飛成列。凝眸都是傷春物，嬌滴棠梨，何心去折！　
　　集賢賓　
　　花飛碎玉飄香屑，凴欄目斷天涯。猛聽黃鸝聲弄舌，喚起我離愁切切。狠心薄劣，閃得我羅裙寬摺。無聊也，自且把珠簾半揭。
　　黃鶯兒　
　　枝頭梅乍結，困人天，微雨歇。南薰獨對枉自嗟，冰弦懶撥，香泉懶啜。端為恩情一旦撇。心哽咽，淚濕紗衫，相看都是血。
　　玉抱肚　
　　情乖愛奪，盼佳期，頓成永絕。空堪羨，並蒂荷花。怎支吾，暮蟬聲迭。蘭湯浴罷鬢雲斜，倩誰將我腰脫！　
　　山坡羊　
　　滿地舞旋紅葉。欲待題詩難寫。近日臨妝，不覺嬌姿怯。親瓜葛，夢與同歡悅。又被西風忽動簷頭鐵，頃刻驚開原各別。悶也，拍瑤台燈滅。怨也，擲菱花拼碎跌。
　　五供養　
　　西廂待月，挨幾個黃昏時節。相思滋味逐頭斷，秋來更徹。是誰家砧杵聲頻，搗得我憂心欲裂。芳盟盡屬空，好事翻成拙。楚岫雲遮，高唐夢蝶。
　　忒忒令　
　　繡閨寒侵，把獸爐慢　。歎藍關，人阻截。幾番間揉碎梅花，揉碎梅花，惜孤衾，香自潔，怕寒鴉，啼漸越。
　　僥僥令　
　　愁結板橋霜，夢冷茅簷雪。書翠流紅事已賒。甚時得破鏡圓，斷簪接。
　　尾聲　
　　相思擔重苦難車，拼與他珠沉玉缺。你不見程姬，貞且烈。
　　是歲丁丑至元三年也。民間訛言朝廷拘刮童女，一時嫁娶殆盡。有趙應京者，新蔭萬戶官也，家極富，性落魄不羈，好鷹犬博弈，素慕嬌名，礙生，不能啟齒。今聞訛言，乃以金五百，夜賄士彪，欲求娶鳳。彪性貪，竟許之，且使老婢告夫人曰：「我因一忿，以致參商。每念寡婦孤兒，不忍一見。不若另覓東牀，別聯新好，使老有所托，幼有所歸，不亦可乎。況吳生官斷，義難復全，彼必重婚，我何空守？」夫人未及對。鳳即應曰：「噫！是何言歟！吾叔利人之有，不義；割人之愛，不仁；既許而又背之，不信。吾與吳生，父母主盟，媒妁議禮，情義所在，人皆知之。今欲悔約而謀傾，固非君子厚德之道，亦豈婦人從一之心？拜復吾叔：吾頭可斷，吾身決不可辱也。」婢以此言達彪。彪知不可強，乃囑趙子曰：「鳳姐情義不屈，計取為宜。擇一吉辰，爾多帶從僕，以親迎為名，從則可矣，如其不然，始以官勢逼之，繼以溫言誘之，嬌年幼質，必有所動，當不久負執迷也。」應京大喜，候日舉行，不料為老僕抱其不平，竟走報鳳。鳳私度曰：「老賊所為，險惡無比，吾力既不能制，吾名又不可污，亦莫如之何也，已矣！將欲自盡，乃作書遺生曰：
　　難妾王嬌鳳斂衽拜大文元汝玉夫君大人辱愛下：始而說盟，君心既已屬之妾；既而成禮，妾心亦已屬之君。正議魚水百年，不料風波一旦。使我有容不整，有花不簪，玩月反助清苦，吟詩適動幽思，一景一情，無非役吾神、擾吾夢者也。然猶早暮依依，不即為兄輕生者，蓋冀彼有所悔耳。既悔，則樂昌複合、延平再還，隱忍之罪，不猶可贖也哉。豈意怙惡不悛，變中生變，移花於別種，割我良緣；輟玉於他田，斷兄雅愛。當此時也，欲拼一死，慨兄面之未瞻；欲待苟全，痛妾名之已辱。故與其喪節以捐名，不若死者之為愈與？其徒死而不足以償千百年之恨，又不若姑存自待，萬一得見之為尤愈乎？生不可，死不可，進退兩難，會離莫測，雖微軀弱質不足以伴賢哲者心，而斷玉聯金，尚猶在目也。兄忍蔑視而不為之痛耶？情絲縷縷，筆難遍傳，聊上一緘，敢求來會，則妾死生有所訣矣。敢書，敢書。
　　生得書駭愕，即兼道赴之。又不敢顯然自進，乃匿於昔日浣衣之老嫗家，持金為禮，使得通焉。挨至鼓餘。二嬌乃遣春英輩密開小門，放生私入。相見時，各各大慟，但不出聲。鳳因謂生曰：「愚姊妹幸與兄遇，恩愛已非一朝，准擬長松可依，朱弦得托，三生偕老，家室優游。詎意門牆起變，半路相拋，使海義山情，冰消瓦解。故今請兄至者，非他意也，將欲與兄一面，少釋終天，必不忍冒恥辱身，甘作因風之柳絮，順水之桃花。兄自此後，亦當善自珍養，候事少息，與吾姐伉儷百年，實妾至願，萬毋為妾以傷貴重也。」言訖，悲咽不勝，淚痕如線。生含淚曰：「好事多磨，佳期難偶，自古然者。今之所值，想亦僕命所該，何忍反累。」鳳又謂鸞曰：「老賊屬意在我，勢不俱生，我死則無事矣。」生曰：「無累也。彼丈夫也，我丈夫也，吾何畏哉，必當出力與之較焉。」　
　　正彼此論間，春英謂生、鳳曰：「天下事，權則通，泥則病。一時奮激，徒作溝渠，於事何益？不若默忍潛為，再圖歡慶。」生憮然曰：「計得矣。昔相如竊文君以亡，辜生挾瑜娘而走，古人於事之難處者，有逃而已。今當買舟湖下，與鳳姐乘月東歸，僻逕潛蹤，待時舒志，彼求不得，縱有惡謀詭計，將何施哉！苟便可乘，續謀兼並，猶未晚也。」眾美皆曰：「善。」於是托鄰嫗周旋，略檢妝資，與嬌鸞掩淚而別。舟行時，鼓已三矣。途中無聊，有聯句《古風》一首喻生為首倡，鳳次之焉。
　　露氣侵衣月在河，吁嗟好事反成磨，世間只有相思苦，偏我相思苦更多，今夜蘭房燈火明，大聲唱別愁千結，歸心一似戀帆風，疊疊重重急且咽。水靜天空雲慘淒，人離家遠夢魂迷。依稀重締生前願，往事傷心怕再提。怕提往事姑擁膝。夾岸蘋蘆秋瑟瑟。一篙撐出波濤中，免使鯨鯤受塵湯。悠悠世態古道殘，人心尤險行路難。孤根此去托肥土，笑殺王郎成畫虎。
　　越日至湖，覓居鳳凰山中，隱僻深幽，雖生父不覺也。
　　士彪以嬌鳳之變自激而成，然勢不能救，徒悔而已。鸞雖與謀，亦困於孤立之苦，風晨月夕，思怨之情，不可勝記。聊錄數章，為好事者一覽。
　　春愁睡起不勝悲，往事顛危誰與持？　
　　魂逐游蜂身似借，腸牽飛絮意如癡。
　　淚痕隱血心從落，臉氣生香手自支。
　　幾度更深眠未穩，伴人惟有漏遲遲。
　　別時記得共芳尊，今日猶餘萬種恩。
　　繡妒鴛鴦閒白晝，書空魚雁盼黃昏。
　　一番對月一成夢，幾度臨風幾斷魂。
　　挑盡殘燈淒切處，薄衾香冷倩誰溫！　
　　曉妝台下思重重，懊歎何時笑語同？　
　　情傍游絲牽嫩綠，意隨流水戀殘紅。
　　當年自恨春如錦，今日應知色是空。
　　回首雕欄情況惡，閒愁千里付孤鴻。
　　錦帳朝寒只愛眠，相思如水夜如年。
　　新詩篾裂慚吟雪，舊事淒涼怕問天。
　　酒去愁縈心一寸，夢回神繞路三千。
　　人情變幻難憑計，何處鸞膠續斷弦！　
　　空庭草色翳苔茵，無奈深愁一樣新。
　　鳳髻亂盤渾似懶，蛾眉淡掃不如人。
　　夢中得合非真樂，帳裡無郎實是貧。
　　起傍花陰強排遣，數聲杜宇更傷神。
　　凴欄無語怨東風，愁遇春歸恨轉濃。
　　一枕鳳鸞魂杳杳，半窗花月影重重。
　　　環聲細千般懶，脂粉容消萬事慵。
　　紙短話長題不盡，慇懃寄取早相逢。
　　碧桃深處聽啼鶯，一似聲聲怨別輕。
　　翠鳳有情欹綠鬢，彩裙無力扶紅纓。
　　楊花未肯隨風舞，葵萼還應向日傾。
　　種種幽情羞自語，安排衾枕度初更。
　　無端日日鎖雙蛾，縷縷愁來疊似波。
　　空憶高情疑是夢，難禁積恨欲成魔。
　　堪嗟好事全終少，深憾佳期不偶多。
　　拂鬢自憐還自歎，名花無主奈如何！　　
　　是歲，伯顏以罪徙龍興，乃復科舉制。生曰：「此吾明冤之一大機會，當不可失。」即辭鳳赴試，果領鄉薦。及親策，又中左榜。左丞相孛兒怯不花素喜生才，竟選生為翰林承旨。生以未娶，奏聞朝廷，詔歸娶。至家，賀者填門。生欲議日畢姻，鳳謂曰：「人情處安樂，不忘患難。向與我姐說盟，協意事兄，今妾先舉而背之，置我姐於何處，不若並妾送歸，使老母上主，迎兄至家，與愚姐妹花燭，庶不失吾贅兄之意也。亦且名正言順，惡叔何辭！」生曰：「此論甚當。」即為達鸞，兼送鳳回。
　　夫人、嬌鸞聞之，大喜，乃擇十月戊戌之吉－－至正三年也，迎生入贅之禮。乘鸞後，生謂鸞、鳳曰：「平生素願，中道一阻，不料復有日，天乎？人手？但士彪之忿，未能少雪，豈丈夫耶？」鳳曰：「彼雖不仁，份在骨肉。若乘勢而窘之，無有不便，但睥睨芥蒂，不惟情涉於此，亦且量為不弘，故曰：『寧人負我，毋我負人』。兄能忍人之所不能忍，容人之所不能容，正大丈夫也，何留心於小小哉。」生喜，舉杯大飲，因浩歌一絕云：
　　拜罷天墀膽氣粗，歸來醉倩玉人扶。
　　龍泉三尺書千卷，方是人間一丈夫。
　　未終，春英報曰：「叔叔才上縊，竟絕咽矣。」生笑曰：「此天假手以快也。」不料彪子見父之變，愧赧痛悼，亦相與投池中。急使人救援，一最幼者。其餘三子，皆夫人為之發喪，各各從厚殯殮。
　　家事悉生掌握，因謂夫人曰：「錯蒙厚愛，累罪良多。孰意天眷儒，僥登一第，且人亡事白，兩姓萬全，豈非至幸者乎？若竟戀夫妻之而怡樂於外堂，使堂上者一無所侍，人子之情，不能恝然而無所繫，不若同至家中，處夫人於別院，所存房產，悉與彪叔之子，則在我父子之養，在夫人有母子之歡，在孤有得所之托，將不兩得也哉。」夫人曰：「我年老志短，所為事一依公子。」生乃擇日命駕，一家起行。
　　官民有送生者，列鼓吹笙。舟中風景，不能盡述，有《臨江仙》詞以道之：
　　心事今朝除悒怏，只憐雲饒家鄉。豪情騎鶴任翱翔。手扳仙苑桂，身惹御爐香。極目煙霞迷畫舫，一天紫綠斜陽。遠山偏向望中長。將何酬美景，宿酒醉新妝。
　　至家，生父甚喜，即設宴宴夫人。酒罷，生偕鸞、鳳寢。鸞與生笑語自如，獨鳳俯首凴几，若有所憶者。生問曰：「我與卿歷盡艱辛，幸得至此，正宜求樂而反含優；何耶？」鳳不答，但潸然淚下。生惶悚曰：「僕果有罪，請試數之，何煩自苦如此。」鳳曰：「兄知今日聚合之樂，獨不念昔年引見之功乎？」生曰：「雲姨盛德，今雖欲報，安從施哉？」鳳曰：「念我雖非抱育，然而恩情契重，則勝嫡也。幼年刺繡既沐提攜，壯歲姻親又承吹贊，本欲托我以終身，不料去而不復返。爾我於朱樓綺閣中吟詩酌酒，使彼孤魂旅柩流落他鄉，麥飯香花，欲依無主，於情於份，安得不哀！」言畢，又泣。生撫抱曰：「是我責也。非卿言，幾作薄倖徒矣。然亦不難，明當遣人移柩至家，建醮以報，慎毋勞卿憂抑也。」生即使人往安國寺遷棺，往返月餘方至，則請玄武觀劉真人為法主，起建水陸齋七日。生、鳳亦薰沐虔誠，晝夜不懈。醮畢，擇後園空地築壙以厝。
　　是夜，生因連日事擾，暫憩外書齋中，倦倚醉牀之上。方閉目，夢見巫雲徐步而前，貌飭如故，曰：「別來憂恨，一旦感疾而亡，後會成虛，盟言難續，追思痛傷，然亦祿命所該。」語未終，生即抱住曰：「久思無覓，今從何來？汝不死耶？」雲曰：「冥司以妾無罪，留妾在子孫宮中，候陰例日滿，托生貴家。今蒙公子水陸超度，復授妾為本司掌冊之官，侍伴天妃，安閒逸豫，得不入鬼　塵寰者，皆公子惠也。今特致謝，聊釋別來之情，嗣此不敢見矣。」含淚欲去。生又抱定，曰：「子既成仙，何妨再見？」雲曰：「公子未知也。冥司立法，比世尤嚴，毫有所私，重罰不赦。公子善自珍愛，我檢簿籍，有二貴子，合生汝門，不必我念，我當永別矣。」生急持其衣，雲乃頓袂而去。生驚覺，餘香猶在。生趨報鳳曰：「鬼神之事，昔嘗議其佛氏之誣，以今觀之，信有之矣。」　
　　鳳問故，生以前夢悉為誦之。鳳曰：「若如此，我不負雲姨矣。」及言貴子事，鳳又拊掌曰：「果娠三月，未知璋瓦何如。」再問鸞，鸞亦懷娠妊日，各大笑。生乃備牲醴致奠，鸞、鳳則共作文以哭之：
　　嗚呼！以姨之賢，祿宜未艾；以姨之德，壽將天假。胡為乎雲散秋空，雪消春海？何為乎玉　光埋，花飛香碎？嗚呼！姨雖逝矣。鸞將安賴；痛哉！鳳雖在矣，姨何能愛。徒使帳鎖餘香，鏡空鮮黛，無地通恩，有天難戴。嗚呼！痛針刺之猶存，想音容之恍在。恨彼蒼之無憑，奪玉人之何邁。是以腸斷欲聯，眼枯無奈，見山知怨，望雲興慨。嗚呼！仰仙魂之遙遙，望爐煙而長拜苟或靈其有知，願芳蘋之略採！
　　後至正四年十月朔日，鸞、鳳各生一子，俱在同時，聞者無不駭異，因呼為「三奇、二絕」，鄉閭傳誦不已。有好事者作詞美之，不天盡錄。
　　生慕果報之理，乃棄官營修，寡慾養氣，開義井於路，造賑倉於家。族有寒微者助之，人有孤寡者給之，築街蓋殿，塑佛飯僧。凡有便於人之事，雖損己為之，不恤也。
　　生以二子由神力所致，乃名其鸞出者為天與，鳳出者為天錫，七歲能明經，及長，文武俱優。正欲赴舉業之科，奈張士誠以兵陷湖，生復挈家避難於鳳凰山，不求聞達。一門三代，聚樂怡怡。或著述群書。或調議世務，或謳吟於青山綠水之前，或飲酌於清風明月之下。耕食鑿飲，別是人間，不知其有紅巾草莽之亂也。
　　及至正二十六年，大明兵取杭嘉湖等路，生父子喜曰：「真天子出矣。急出報效，不失丈夫所為。有功即歸，不可久戀取禍也。」生乃自薦。天與為李國公善長參謀，天錫為徐國公達部將。及攻略有功，我太祖封與為樞密官，錫為元帥之職。二子受命，不任而歸。後李、徐二公使人迫之鳳凰山，並祖、父不知去向矣。

　　平江吳邑有華姓者，諱國文，字應奎。厥父曰袞，係進士出身，官授提學僉事，主試執法，不受私謁，宦族子弟，類多考黜。遂被暗論致仕，謝絕賓客，杜門課子。國文年方十五，狀貌魁梧，天姿敏捷，萬言日誦，古今《墳》《典》，無不歷覽，舉業之外，尤善詩賦。會有司匯考，生即首拔，一邑之中，聲價特重。
　　生父先年聘鄰邑同年知府張大業之女，與生為妻。張無男嗣，止生二女，貌若仙姬，愛惜如玉，遍尋姆訓，日夕閨中教之，故不特巧於刺繡，凡琴棋、音律、詩畫、詞賦，無不漁獵。長名曰端，字正卿，年十八，配生；次名曰從，字順卿，年十六，配同邑卿官趙姓者之子。
　　是歲，生父母遣禮，命生親迎。既娶，以新婦方歸，著生暫處西廳書館肄業。不意端與生伉儷之後，溺於私愛，小覷功名。居北有名園一所，乃袞宦游憩之地，創有涼亭，雕欄畫棟，極其華麗。壁間懸大家名筆，几上列稀世奇珍，佳聯掇畫，耳目繁華，大額標題古今墳典，誠人間之蓬島，凡世之廣寒也。生每與端遊玩其間，或題詠，或琴棋，留連光景，取樂不一。
　　一日，蓮花盛開，二人在亭，並肩行賞。忽見鴛鴦一對，戲於蓮池。端引生袂，謂曰：「昔人有謂『蓮花似六郎』，識者譏其阿譽太過，今觀此鳥雙雙，絕類妾與君也。不識稱謂之際，當曰鴛鴦之似妾與君乎？妾與君似鴛鴦乎？」生曰：「予與君似鴛鴦也。」端曰：「何以辯之？反以人而不如鳥乎？」生即誦古詩一絕以答之，云：「江島之巔煙霧微，綠蕪深處剔毛衣。渡頭驚起一雙去，飛上文君舊錦機。以是詩觀之，此鳥雖微，然生有定偶，不惟其無事而雙雙同游，雖不幸而舟人驚逐，雌雄或失，終不易配，是其德尤有可嘉者。若夫吾人或先貧而後棄於妻，或後貴而遂忘乎婦，以此論之，殆不如也。」端曰：「或棄或忘，此買臣、百里奚夫婦之薄倖態耳，此奚足齒！但所謂鴛鴦之永不相違者，妾與君當以之自效也。」因歸庭索筆，謂生曰：「請各題數語，以為鴛鴦之敘可乎？」生曰：「卿如有意，予奚靳焉。」乃首綴《一剪梅》詞曰：
　　菡蕊初開雨乍晴，香滿孤亭，綠滿孤亭。
　　一雙微步泛波輕，時掠浮萍，共掠浮萍。
　　端傍視，因曰：「君詞白雪陽春，固難為和，但各自為題，猶不足以表一體之情，君如不以白璧青蠅之玷為嫌，妾請終之，共成一詞，何如？」生笑曰：「得卿和之，豈不益增紙價耶？」欣然授筆。端續題曰：
　　人傳夙世是韓憑，生也多情，死也多情。共君挽柳結同心，從此深盟，莫負深盟。
　　書成，二人交玩，如出一手，喜不自勝，相與款狎亭中。
　　不意文宗欲定科舉，文書已到。生父聞知，即往西廳尋生，及至，其門早已闔矣；然猶意其在內也，歸，令母喚之。夫婦俱不在室，袞大駭，因以端侍妾月梅者掬之，方知生、端頻往園中遊玩。父震怒不已。
　　月梅匆匆至亭報知，生、端惶懼潛回。父已抱氣就寢，生往臥內，侍立久之，竟不得一語。蓋袞雖止生一子，然治家甚嚴。生素性至孝，見父忿怒之深，恐傷致疾，乃跪而害曰：「茲因北園蓮茂，竊往一觀，罪當譴責。但大人春秋高大，暫息震怒，以養天年。不肖明日自當就學於外，以其無負義方是訓也。」父亦不答。時生母亦往責新婦，方出，見生戰戰不寧，乃為之解曰：「此子年殊未及，故蹈此失。今姑宥之，俟其赴考取捷，以贖前罪。」父乃起而責之曰：「夫人子之道，立身揚名，干蠱克家，乃足為孝。吾嘗奉旨試士，見宦家子弟借父兄財勢，未考之時，淫蕩日月，一遇試期，無不落魄，此吾所深痛者，今汝不體父心，溺於荒怠，何以自振！汝母之言，固秀才事也，然此不足為重，欲解父憂，必俟來秋寸進則已，不然，任汝所之，勿復我見！」生唯唯而退。
　　至夜歸室，惆悵不己。端至，亦不與言。端恐其怨己也，乃肅容斂衽而言曰：「今者妾不執婦道，受譴固宜，貽咎於君，此心甚愧。但往者難諫，來猶可追。」遂取筆立成一詞，以示自責之意，曰：
　　雕欄畔，戲鴛鴦，彩筆題詩句短長。欲冀百年長聚首，誰知今日作君殃。
　　裙釵須乏丈夫剛，改過從茲不敢忘。不敢忘，蘋蘩中饋，慰我東牀。
　　題訖，置之於几。生覽畢，見端首倚席，有無聊之狀，乃以手挽之，曰：「予非怨卿，卿何有慝之深也。」然端平昔人前言笑不苟，是時見侍妾月梅在旁，心甚羞澀，但欲解生之憂，故不敢拒。於是紿月梅曰：「官人醉矣，汝且就睡，或有喚汝，當即起。」　
　　梅去，端徐撫生背，曰：「然則既非恨妾，殆恨親乎？」生曰：「親，焉敢恨也。實自悔失言矣。」端詢其故。生曰：「向者欲慰大人之怒，乃以明日出外就學為對。今思欲踐其言，則失愛於子。欲堅執不去，則重觸乎父。是以適間不與子言者，正思此無以為計，而縈悶於懷，本他無所恨也。卿能與我謀之，則此心之憂釋矣」端曰：「君言謬矣。妾與君今日之事過也，非大人之事過也。大人之責，宜也，君向者之對，正也。妾方欲改過不暇，容敢他有所謀乎！」生見端詞嚴意正，乃曰：「卿之所言，皆大義所在，固當嘉納矣。但未見子有相慰之情，設使明日遽別，豈真無一節之可言？過而乃辟耳。」對曰：「一節之事，妾不敢自愛，他則無所可謀也。」生佯如不喻其意，乃與之戲曰：「卿所謂不敢自愛者，果何事也？」端欣然不答。生故逼之，端笑曰：「巾櫛之事矣。」生曰：「靜夜無事盥沐，何用巾櫛？」端語窮。生持問益堅，端曰：「此事君不言而喻，如何苦以其難言羞人耶。」答問之際，不覺獵喜生，兩相泠浹，華乃滅燈與端就寢。
　　次日，生往西廳，檢點書籍，令家童搬往學中，乃入中堂，生辭父母。父亦竟不出見，但令母與生曰：「今後必須有喚方可回來，不然，不如勿出也。」生領諾，默默而往。至學，與諸友講論作課，忽經一月。文宗到郡，諸友皆慕生才識，接次相邀。生以父嚴，不敢歸家，惟著僕回，取行李合用之物，與友登程。乃致詩一首，令僕付端辭別。詩曰：
　　自別芳卿一月餘，瀟瀟風雨動愁思。
　　空懷玉珥魂應斷，隔別金釵體更臞。思寄雨雲嫌雁少，夢游巫峽怕雞呼。
　　今朝欲上功名路，總把離情共紙疏。
　　端得生詩，知其憶己之切，正欲思一詞以慰之，奈生父促僕，匆匆不能即就。乃尋劍一口、酒一樽，並書古風一首以為勉。詩曰：
　　丈夫非無淚，不灑別離間。
　　仗劍對樽酒，恥為游子顏。
　　蝮蛇一蜇子，壯士疾解腕。
　　所志在功名，離別何足歎。
　　僕至，以端詩呈生。眾友覺之，意其必有私語也。相與奪之。及開緘，止古詩一首而已。眾友相謂曰：「此語雖非出自胸臆，然引用實當。觀此，則其所作可知矣。誠不愧為華兄之敵偶也。」或疑曰：「中間必有緣故。」復探生袖，因得其與端詩稿，諸友相與傳觀，鼓掌笑謔久之，然後啟行。
　　及抵郡，則生之姨夫趙姓者，亦在候考。店舍相近，日夕相見，而趙子禮生仁厚。又數日，文宗出示會考。生與趙同入棘圍。試畢，本道對面揭曉發放，華生已考第一。其姨夫趙者，因溺於飲博，學業荒蔬，已被考黜，抱氣奔歸。
　　時生與諸友在郡縣送文宗，適有術士開張，道前談相，士庶羅列，稱驗者萬口如一。諸友謂生曰：「在此列者，惟兄無不如意，曷往卜之？」生曰：「術士之言，多出欺誑，不足深信。縱果如其言，亦無益於事。」內一友云：「兄事弟已知矣，只為怕娘子，恐他於稠人之中說出根腳。」生曰：「非也。」又一友云：「觀前日所寄之詩，則華兄娘子必不如此。彼特吝財耳。」生笑曰：「二者均非所忌，諸兄特過疑耳。」友曰：「兄欲釋二者之疑，必屈一相。」生曰：「何傷乎。」諸友即擁生入帳中，曰：「此相公害羞，我等強他來相，汝可試為評之。」術士見生容貌異常，熟視久之，乃曰：「解元尊相，文齊福齊，不知欲隨何處講起？」生曰：「目前足矣。」相者乃以富貴榮盛之事，按相細陳。諸友曰：「此事我等俱會相了。只看得招妻、得子如何。」相者曰：「妻皆賢，子亦有「生詰之曰：「賢則賢，有則有，乃若『皆賢』『亦有』之言；相書載於何篇？」相者笑而答曰：「此乃尊相之小疵，故未敢先告。解元問及，不得不言。所謂『皆賢』者，應招兩房也；曰『亦有』者，應次房得之也。」生終不以為然。正欲辯之，比文宗起馬。生令從者以錢償之，奔送出城。
　　文宗既去，本日生與諸友言旋。及至邑，復往學中，乃令家僮先報於母，示以歸省之意。母言於父，父曰：「今日若子事業畢耶？任汝主之。」母不知父亦有與歸之意，乃謂其「不與歸」。端聞之，制詩一律，著僕付生，以堅其志。詩曰：
　　聞君已奪錦標回，萬疊愁眉漸掃開。
　　字接風霜知富學，篇連月露見雄才。
　　廣寒有路終須到，丹桂期扳豈藉媒。
　　寄語多情新宋玉。明秋捷報擬重來。
　　僕以端詩與生，並述母言。生將端詩數上吟詠，以丹砂飛書，朝夕觀之，以自策勵。歸寧之志，亦不復萌。
　　忽有客自生岳父之邑至者，生往拜，詢以外家動履，客因以趙子失志捐館告之。生傷悼不已。辭客歸齋，思小姨雖未入趙門，然考時接見趙子，相禮甚恭，若不舉弔，似為情薄。因以此意稟於父母，父曰：「此厚道也，況外家久欠問安，一往即回可也。」　
　　生得命，乃回，與端備禮而往。端修書一紙，臨行付生曰：「數字煩君帶與阿妹順卿，以慰其拂鬱之心。」生曰：「男女授受不親，況彼我尤當避嫌，何以得達？」端曰：「妾在家時，更有使女香蘭者，君今去，妾父母必遣備君使令。令彼達之，得矣。」生乃以書收袖，別端而行。
　　將近，生令僕先行報知。張夫婦大喜，遂出門延生而入。至庭，生敘禮畢，張夫婦慰之再三，生亦申敘間闊。頃間酒至，主起揖就席，席間所談，皆二氏家事，唯弔喪一節，生以嫌疑，欲俟張道及然後舉也。殊不知此子在日不肖，父母惡之，鄉人賤之，張正悔與為婚，一旦而死，舉家欣快，以此之故，所以席間不道。
　　時張夫婦俱在席，惟從與諸侍妾在內。從為人淑慎端重，不窺不觀，無故不出中堂前者。生新至時，諸侍妾咸曰：「大娘子新官人在外，今其坐正對窗櫺，娘子曷往觀之？」從叱之曰：「彼丈夫也，我女子也，何以看為！」續後因童僕往來屢稱生「才學為一時珍重，又與端相敬如賓」，而彼趙氏者眾皆鄙之，心恒鬱鬱。今報已死，事聞信至，乃謂香蘭曰：「人言汝娘子姐夫恁般溫雅，果信然否？」因與蘭立於窗後潛視。見生才貌舉動，俱如人言；又見父母特加敬禮，喟然歎曰：「阿姊何修得此？予今後所擇，若更如前，誓不歸矣。」言罷，不覺有所感觸，唏噓之聲，竟聞於席。然張夫婦年大，耳不及聞。生思：「此必小姨，因見己而憶趙子也。」不覺勃然之色，見於其面，遂托醉求退。而張亦以婿途中勞倦，即促飯撤席。已而，果命香蘭曰：「此汝娘子官人，早晚盥沐，汝當奉巾櫛。」因就令執燭導生寢。
　　生至寢所，乃取端書付蘭，曰：「汝既大娘子侍妾，可將此書奉與二娘子，千萬不可失落。」蘭接生書，即歸，未看封皮，不知寄自端，以為出於生也；心中疑惑，慌至從房。
　　從正燃燈悶坐，見蘭至，問曰：「何事行急？」蘭低語曰：「一事甚好笑。」從曰：「何事？」曰：「華官人初到，與娘子又未相見，適間妾因照他寢所，乃以一書著妾付與娘子，不知所言何事。」從厲聲曰：「何有此舉！快將出去！」蘭忙將書藏袖內，趨出房門，不覺其書失落在地。蘭去，被從撿之，乃私開就燈燭之，則端書也。正看間，蘭尋書復至，從以手指蘭曰：「這賤人，險些被你誤驚一場。此汝娘子之書，何妄言如此。」蘭曰：「妾實不知，然恰喜大娘子所寄，若寄自官人，娘子開看，豈復還乎。」從聽其言，亦難以對，且佯答曰：「將阿姊書看何如。」　　
　　女兄端書奉賢妹順卿妝次：敘別於歸，數更莢。思親之念未嘗忘，而日省無自；有家之願雖已遂，然婦道未終。但幸主蘋蘩於中饋，大人無責備之心；侍巾櫛於帷房，君子有刮目之顧。區區之心，竊自慰也。夫何魚躍淵中，吾心克遂得天之私願；詎意鴉鳴樹杪，若郎遽有棄世之訃音！令人聞之，食不下咽。然而欲慰悲傷，，當求所幸於不幸；要舒尊結，宜合難求於可求。吾聞趙子立志卑污，每稱羞於奴僕；素行薄劣，恒致惡於鄉間。彼身雖逝，喜溫嶠未下鏡台，無累大德；爾年正青，幸伯牙能彈流水，豈乏知音？切宜善自遣排，以圖後膺天眷；莫為無益之悲，致損生香之玉。予也，心遠地偏，無由而會，今因檀郎赴弔，敬付寸楮，以慰汝懷。不宣。
　　從讀至「鴉鳴樹杪，若郎遽有棄世之訃音」，不覺長吁數聲，墮淚濕紙；又見「喜溫嶠未下鏡台，無累大德」，乃曰：「阿姊何不寫此在前，免人煩忙。」香蘭曰：「且更看後面何如。」二人看畢，乃知生專為舉弔而來，從因謂蘭曰：「汝明早奉水，何不與華姑夫說知，叫他不必提起弔喪之事，那人雖死，我相公嫌他不如，只說敬來問安，豈不更美？」蘭退，口雖不言，心下自忖：「向者之書須誤說，而彼竟問之，今又教他勿舉弔喪之事，其喜生之心已動於窗後之一觀矣。」　
　　次早，生起著衣時，香蘭在窗外潛知生已起，奉水盥生。生因問曰：「書已達否？」蘭想起昨夜錯誤之事，乃帶笑容曰：「已達矣。」生意蘭笑己，固問之，蘭曰：「昨者妾錯認書是官人的，俺娘子驚而怒焉。及開封，方知是大娘子的，所以可笑。」生斥之曰：「汝誤說有之。汝娘子識字，封外明寫大娘子所寄，何待開封方知？」蘭曰：「彼時因妾失落在地，娘子拾得，欲背妾開看，未及詳觀護封，所以錯認。」生聽其言，默然良久，因復問曰：「汝娘子那時更有言否？」蘭乃述其「令勿往弔」之事。生深感之，曰：「若非汝娘子示知，今日正欲親詣往弔，未免竟把此嫌。汝回見娘子，多上替我申謝。」　
　　時生既不赴弔，張又固留，乃先命僕歸。張夫婦詢知生因與端觀蓮被責，出外讀書，不與回家，考試後學中諸友又各移回，惟生一人在彼，甚是寂寥。張即遣人與生僕同至生家，稟以留生讀書之意。袞喜曰：「遠於妻子」，欣然應允。時生不知，越數日，又辭歸。張夫婦曰：「賢婿欲歸之急者，只為讀書。老夫舍後有一小閣，略堪容膝，賢婿不棄，此地寂靜，亦好用功。」生曰：「國文忝在半子，荷　上恩愛，喜出望外，但恐家君不容耳。」張因告以父母亦允之意。生思：「歸家亦不得與端相會，不如在此，免似學中寂寥。」乃遂拜諾。本日，即館生於後閣。其閣門有二：一開於張之屋左，以通賓客遊玩；一自中堂而入，要經從刺繡窗下而達。當日，張即令生由從出入，以避外人交接。
　　生至閣，文房畢具。張有門生數人，皆有才望，時令與生作課。居一月餘，生工程無缺，但以久別於端，心恒悶悶，乃作《長相思》詞一首以自遣。詞曰：
　　坐相思，立相思，望斷雲山倍慘吁，此情孰與舒？才可如，貌可如，更使溫柔都已具，堅貞不似渠。
　　生制成，欲留以寄端，乃以片紙書之，黏於書廚之內。忽蘭至，曰：「老夫人今日壽辰，開宴堂中，請官人一同慶賞。」生得命即出。經過窗前，聞蘭花馥馥。生曰：「何處花氣襲人？」蘭以手指窗。生趨視之，見一女子在內，手捻花枝。生知是小姨，慌道：「不敢詳視。」　
　　及至堂，肴饌潔備，正將登席，張夫婦入屏後間語，又喚蘭數聲，方出。生疑議己之未遣禮也。其色甚慚，乃曰：「今者岳母華誕，小婿缺禮，負愧殊深。」張慌慰之，曰：「適間愚夫婦他無所言，因次小女與賢婿前未相見，今日汝岳母賤辰，遣蘭喚小女出拜，以成一家之樂耳。」生色少定。少頃，蘭與從至，母令與生敘禮。禮畢就坐，生側目之，豔質與端無異，而妝點尤勝。女亦覷生，各相默羨。酒至半酣，生起為壽，次當及從。張曰：「姊夫，客也，汝當奉酒。」二人酬酢之際，推讓不飲，母曰：「毋讓，各飲二杯。」生一飲舉回時，從方舉杯未酹。蘭與侍妾在傍代酌，私相語曰：「外人來見，只說是一對夫妻。」從聞之，禁笑不住，將酒少噴於盞，托顏甚愧。生覺之，令蘭再酌己酒，飲之，以掩其事。從竟只飲一杯，心甚德之。張夫婦不知其意，以生有酒力，乃與生更相酬奉。席罷，生醉往閣就寢。
　　次早，蘭以生昨醉，奉水去，乃過從窗下。從在內呼曰：「何往？」蘭因顧焉，見從几上新寄蘭花二串，蘭指曰：「何用許多？」從曰：「汝試猜之。」蘭曰：「欲以一串與老夫人？」從曰：「非也。」曰：「欲與老相公乎？」從曰：「相公素不好此。」蘭思昨日生過此，曾問此花，意其必與生也，乃曰：「吾知之矣。」從曰：「果誰？」蘭曰：「莫非華姨夫乎？」從曰：「是固是矣，但汝將去，不必說是我的。」蘭首肯即行。至閣，生已起，久候水不至，因思：「若非岳母壽辰，小姨無由得見。」乃作詩一律，以紀其美。詩曰：
　　飛瓊昨日下瑤樓，為是蟠桃點壽籌。
　　玉臉　融嬌欲脆，柳腰嫋娜只成羞。
　　捧杯漫露纖纖筍，啟語微開細細榴。
　　不是愚生曾預席，安信江東有二喬？　　
　　生正將詩敲推，聽窗外有履聲。生出視，見蘭手執蘭花，問曰：「何以得此？」蘭曰：「妾正為往外庭天井摘此，所以奉水來遲。」生以為然。及接至手，見其串花者乃銀線，因謂曰：「此物非汝所有，何欺我也？」蘭以從欲避嫌直告。生曰：「以花與我者，推愛之情也；令汝勿言者，守己之正也。一舉而兩得矣。」遂作《點絳唇》一首以頌之：　楚畹謝庭，風露陪香，人人所羨。嫦娥特獻，尤令心留戀。厚情罕有，銀線連行串，還堪眷。避嫌一節，珍重恒無倦。
　　蘭見生寫畢，正將近前觀其題者何語，生即藏於匣內。蘭不得見，乃出，謂從曰：「方才蘭花因穿以銀線，華官人即知是娘子的矣。感歎不已，立制一詞。妾欲近視，即已收之。此必為娘子作也。」從悔曰：「彼處士子頻來，倘有不美之句被人撿之，豈不自貽穢名乎！」心甚怏怏。蘭曰：「吾聞與他來往作文者已具書後日相請，但不知果否。若果，我與娘子往閣開他書廚一看，便見明白。」從深然之。
　　二人商榷方已，從母忽至房中，見從悶坐，曰：「吾兒何不理些針指？」從曰：「數日不快，故慵懶矣。」母復顧窗壁，見新畫一美人對鏡，內題詩云：
　　畫工何事動人愁，偏把嫦娥獨自描。
　　無那想思頻照面，只令顏色減嬌羞。
　　母覽畢，思「畫工何事動人愁」之句，謂從怨己之不與議婚也，遂謂從曰：「前者人來與汝議親，以趙子新亡，故未言及。今事已定，近又四五門相求，皆名門貴族，此事久遠，未可輕許。今數家姓名俱言於汝，任汝自擇，何如？」從不答。母又曰：「此正事，直言無妨。」從隱几不應。蘭因附耳謂母曰：「老夫人且退，待妾問之，彼必不諱。」母退。
　　至夜，蘭詢從曰：「今日老夫人謂娘子自擇之事，何不主之？」從曰：「此事吾亦不能自決。」蘭舉其最富盛者以示之，從曰：「安知異時不貧賤乎？」蘭曰：「娘子若如此，則日月易擲，更待何時？今夜月明如晝，不如與娘子拜告卜之，如祝者納焉。」從然其言。至更時，從與蘭備香案，臨月拜褥曰：「如所願者，乞先報以一陰一陽，而以聖終之。」祝罷，乃以五姓逐一拜問，無一如願。從沉吟半晌，近案再拜，心祝卜之，連擲三次，皆如所祝。從乃長吁數聲，擲之於地曰：「若是，則吾當皓首閨門矣，卜之何益！」蘭曰：「妾觀娘子這回所卜之事，皆如所祝，但不知屬哪一家耳。何故出此不利之言？」從曰：「汝何不察？此第六卜矣，不在五者之內。且卜以決疑，今事在不疑，尚何卜乎？」蘭曰：「但得如此，雖彼未在內，娘子有意，委曲亦可成之，果何患乎。」從曰：「彼已娶矣。」蘭知其所指者在華，亦不復問。忽聞房中侍妾有逐妾之聲，恐母醒知覺，遂與蘭歸房內。
　　過二日，生果以友請赴席。蘭與從潛往閣中，開生書齋房門並書廚，見其有思端之詞一首，內有「堅貞不似渠」之句。從曰：「世言『無好人』三字者，非有德者之言也。貞烈之女，代不乏人，華姨夫何小視天下，而遂謂皆不似阿姊乎？」乃以筆涂去「不」字，注一「亦」字於傍。再尋之，又得其題壽席之詩並頌蘭花之詞，遂懷之於袖。因思蘭日夕與生相近，生不知私之，反過望於己，乃以筆題壁間而所畫黃鶯弔屏云：
　　本是迎春鳥，誰描入畫屏？羽翎雖可愛，不會向人鳴。
　　從題畢，與蘭遁回。
　　比生回房，正欲就枕，見弔屏上新題墨跡未乾，起視之，乃有「不會向人鳴」之句，心甚疑，及看書廚，所作詩詞未見，而欲寄端之詞已改矣。華細思曰：「此必香蘭日前因不與看，故今盜去，而所改所題之意，皆欲有私於己而為毛遂之自薦也。」時香蘭年方十六，性極乖巧，能逢迎人意，且有殊色，生屢欲私之，恐其不諳人事而有所失；及其見詩，欲心大熾，以筆書於粉牌曰：「莫言不是鳴春鳥，陽台雲雨今番按。」時岳母見生帶醉而回，令蘭奉香茶。生見蘭至，曰：「吾正念汝，汝今至矣。」蘭視其顏色，知其發言之意，正欲趨出，生以手闔門而阻之，欲與之狎。蘭不允，生以一手抱之於牀，一手自解下衣，蘭輾轉不得開，即拽斷之，蘭自度難免，因曰：「以官人貴體而欲私一賤妾，妾不敢以偽相拒，但妾實不堪，雖欲勉從，心甚戰懼，幸為護持可也。」生初雖然之，然夫婦久別，今又被酒，將蘭手壓於背，但見峰頭雨密，洞口雲濃，金槍試動，穿雲破壘。蘭齒齧其唇，神魂飄蕩，久之，方言曰：「官人唯知取己之樂，而不肯憐人，幾乎不復生矣。」生撫之曰：「吾觀汝詩並所改之字，則今日之事，正樂人之樂耳，何以憐為？」蘭曰：「妾有何詩？」生指弔屏示之。蘭曰：「所題、所改，皆吾二娘子午前至此為之，並廚內詩詞，亦被袖去，與妾何干？」　
　　生更欲問從有何言語，不意從見蘭久於閣，意其必私於生。乃詐以母令，令侍妾往叫。蘭忙趨出。從曰：「汝出何遲？」蘭倉卒無對。又見其兩鬢蓬鬆，從詰之曰：「汝與華官人做得好事！」蘭不認。從曰：「我已親見，尚為我諱！」蘭恐其白於夫人，事難終隱，只得直告。
　　自後從一見蘭，即以此笑之。蘭思無以抵對，亦欲誘之於生，以塞其口。一日，因送水盥生，生見蘭至，更欲狎之，蘭曰：「妾今傷弓之鳥，不敢奉命，但更有一好事，官人圖之，則必可得。」生曰：「無乃二娘子乎？」曰：「然。」生曰：「吾觀汝娘子端重嚴厲，有難以非禮犯者。且深閨固門，日夕侍女相伴，是所謂探海求珠，不亦難乎！汝特效陳平美人之計，以解高帝白登之圍矣。」蘭曰：「不然。妾觀娘子有意於官人者五。」生曰：「何以證之？」蘭曰：「官人初至而稱歎痛哭，一也；誤遞其書，始雖怒而終閱之，二也；酒席聞妾等『似夫妻』之言即笑，三也；官人聞蘭花而即饋之，四也；月夜卜婚惟六卜許之，乃怒而擲之於地，及問其故，曰『彼已娶矣』，她雖未明言是官人，然大意不言可知矣，此五有意乎官人也。以是觀之，又何難哉？」生初意亦有慕從之心，然思是小姨，一萌隨即過遏，及今聞一心惟許於己，且向者有相士「必招兩房」之言，遂決意圖之。因撫蘭背曰：「是固是矣，何以教我？」蘭曰：「老相公與夫人擇日要往城外觀中還願，若去，必至晚方回。官人假寫一書與妾，待老相公等去後，妾自外持入，雲是會晤相請。官人於黃鶯弔屏詩末著娘子之名於下，潛居別所，妾以言賺之，必與妾來者。那時妾出，官人亦效前番而行，不亦可乎。」生手舞足蹈，喜之如狂，即寫書付蘭，乃作《西江月》一首：
　　淑女情牽意絆，才郎心醉神馳。
　　聞言六卜更稀奇，料應蒼天有意。
　　欲效帝妻二女，須煩紅葉維持。
　　他時若得遂雙飛，管取慇懃謝你。
　　蘭去，生行住坐臥，皆意於從。至期，從父母果出。蘭謂從曰：「前者娘子所遺弔屏，何故將自己名字亦書在上？」從曰：「未也。」蘭曰：「妾看得明白，若非娘子，必華官人添起的。」從不信。蘭曰：「如不信，今日華官人去飲酒，我與娘子親往一觀，即見真假。」從恐蘭賣己，先令侍女先往園中觀看。不知蘭亦料從疑，預先與生商榷，將外閣門反閉，示以生由外門而出。侍妾回曰：「閣內寂無一人，華官人已開大門去矣。」從因疑釋，與蘭同往。
　　蘭開書房門，詐驚訝曰：「娘子少坐，妾外房門失閉，一去即來。」從以為實，正欲以筆涂去弔屏名字，生見蘭去，潛出，牢拴其門，突入書房，將門緊闔。從乃失措，跌臥於地。生忙扶之，謂曰：「前荷玉步光臨，有失迎迓，今敬謹候，得遇，此天意也。無用惶恐。」從羞澀無地，以扇掩面，惟欲啟戶趨出。生再四阻之，從呼蘭不應，罵曰：「賤妾誤我，何以生為！」生復近前慰之，從即向壁而立，其嬌容媚態種種動人。生亦效前番香蘭故事強之，翻覆之際，如鷸蚌之相持。久之，從力不能支，被生鬆開紐扣，衣幾脫。從厲聲曰：「妾千金之軀，非若香蘭之婢比也。君忘親義，如強寇，欲一概以污之，妾力不能拒矣，妾出，即當以死繼之。」言罷僵臥於席，不復以手捍蔽。
　　生慘然感觸，少抑其興，謂從曰：「娘子顧愛之心，見之吟詠，生已知之久矣。今又何故又拒之深也？」從哀泣而告曰：「君乃有室之人耳，豈不能為人長慮耶！」生曰：「長慮之事，子無感歎犬吠之拒，小生自有完璧之計。」從曰：「君未讀《將仲子》之詩乎？其曰『畏我父母』、『畏我諸兄』者，果何謂也？」生曰：「予觀令姊非妒嫉之婦，生當懇之，彼必從命。」從曰：「縱家姊能從，姊妹豈可同事一人乎？且二氏父母，將何辭以達之也？事不能諧，妾思之熟矣。君能以義自處，憐妾之命而不污之，此德銘刻不忘也。」生曰：「堯曾以二姨舜，以此論之，亦姊妹同事一人矣，何嫌之有？」從曰：「彼有父母之命，可也。」生曰：「倘得其命，何如？」從不理得，曰：「若此，庶乎其可矣。」生見從語漸狎，復欲要之，從曰：「君尚不體妾心耶？君果有父母之命，吾寧為君他日之妾，今日死亦不允矣。」生曰：「恐汝非季布之諾也。」從因解所佩香囊投之几，曰：「願以此為質，妾若負心，君以此示人，妾能自立乎？但恐鐵杵磨針，成之難耳。」生知其心堅實，即送出閣。
　　從至閣門之外，思：「前日香蘭出遲，己即次發而笑之，今自留連許久，雖無所私，其跡實似。恐見蘭無以為言。」趑趄難進。生不知，以為更欲有所語己，正欲近之；從見之，恐益露其情，促步歸房。生怏怏回齋。
　　時蘭等遇以戶外喧嚷，出視，未見從回，從心少慰。但以生向者移至，己即不顧而回，恐生疑己無心於彼而敗其蹤跡，書一紙，令蘭達之。
　　失節婦張氏從斂衽百拜奉新解元應奎華先生大人文几：妾愧生長閨門，叨蒙母訓，嘗欲以婦道自修，期不負千古之烈女。故庭闈之外，無故不敢輕出。近者足下下臨蓬篳，義忝眷屬，或有所奉而不令者，蓋推手足之愛己及之，非欲有私於足下也。及聞足下與之吟詠，妾甚悔之。欲達之父母，則恐累大德，不得已，犯行露之戒，欲去其所題之跡。今不幸偶有所遇，而致君之戲，此固知香蘭引誘之罪，而長與足下，豈得為無過哉！但君之過如淡雲之翳月，雲去可以復明。若妾，今雖未愛君辱，然整冠李下，納履瓜園，婢妾之疑，雖蘇張更生，不能復白，其過如玉壺已缺，雖善補者，亦不能令其無瑕矣。彼時倉卒，若得父母之命，當執箕帚於左右。妾歸，終夜思之，必不可得。今後不必以此為懷。所冀者，乞賜哀憐，勿以妾之失節者輕薄於人。妾當閨閫終身，以為君報也。興言至此，不勝悲傷，仁人君子，幸垂鑒諒！　
　　生覽畢，深自怨悔，廢寢忘餐，自思不能成，其誤女終身。乃作書，欲告之端，令端代謀。
　　書令蘭寄之。從知，與蘭私開。內有二啟，其一敘其久別之情，曰：
　　書奉正卿娘子妝次：久違芳容，心切仰慕，寤寐之見，無夜無之。特以大人未有召命，不得即整歸鞭，心恒慊慊而已。所喜者，令椿萱施恩同猶子，馴僕妾勤侍若家僮，數度日月，亦不覺也。乃若賢卿獨守空房，有懸衾篋枕之勞，無調琴鼓瑟之樂，生實累之，生實知之。惟在原情，勿致深怨可也。秋闈在邇，會晤有期，無窮中悃，統俟面悉。
　　其二直述己與從此事，欲令端謀之。從見之大驚，曰：「何此子之不密也。」乃手碎其書。蘭慌止之，曰：「彼令妾寄，今碎之，將何以復？」從語之曰：「彼感於予向者之書，不得已，欲委曲求之阿姊。然不知阿姊雖允，亦無益於事；倘不允，而觸其怒，則是披蓑救火，反甚其患也，令予立於何地耶！不如予自修一書，書內略涉與華視眥之辭，與彼信同封去，彼必致疑，以此怨之，或可得其怒與不怒之心，而亦不至於自顯其跡矣。」蘭曰：「善，請急為之。」從乃修書曰：
　　曩正想間，忽蒙雲翰飛集。啟緘三復，字字慰我彷徨。但此子不肖，自貽伊戚，不足惜。妾所憂者，椿萱日暮，莫續箕裘，家務紛紜，無與為理，不識阿姊亦曾慮及此否也？姐夫駐足後院，動履亨嘉，學業大進，早晚所需，妹令侍妾奉之，不必掛意。秋闈歸試，奪鼇之後更當頻遣往來，以慰父母之心。彼為人極其敦篤，吾姊不必嫌疑也。今因鴻便，聊此奉達，以表下懷。不宣。
　　從寫至「早晚所需，妹令侍妾奉之」之外，乃偽寫「妹親自奉之」，然後用淡墨涂去「親自」二字，乃注「令侍妾」三字施者，以啟其致疑之端。再將二信同函封去。
　　端自生別後，日勤女工。或謂之曰：「娘子富貴兼全，無求不得，無欲不遂，何自勞如此？」端曰：「古人云：『人勞則思，思則善心生；逸則心蕩，蕩則未有不流於淫者。』吾之所為，份耳，何勞之足云。」端之為人，其貞重如此。及得生與從書，見其同緘，又見從書所份改「親自」二字，心果大疑。乃復書與生曰：
　　君歸程在即，他言不贅，但所封貴札，緣何與舍妹同封？且舍妹書中所改字跡，甚是可疑，妾非有所忌而云然，蓋彼係處子，一有所失，終身之玷，累君之德亦大矣，事若如疑，急宜善處，事若方萌，即當遏絕。慎之，慎之！
　　生得端書開看之，乃有「同封」「改字」之說，不知所謂。蘭因告以從改書、己寄之故。生大喜，以為得端之心，事可成矣。令蘭以端書所謂「妾非有忌而去然」並「事若如疑，急宜善處」之語，報之於從。從曰：「此奚足取？特觸彼之怒耳。汝與華官人說知，此事必計出萬全，然後可舉而圖之，苟使勉強曲成，使惡名昭著，予朝聞夕死矣。彼不日亦當赴試，最忌者醉中之語、感歎之筆，他無所言也。若夫不得正娶而終不他適者，予正將以此自贖前過，於彼何尤，於我何惜！」華聞其言，愈增感慕。
　　數日後，袞果走價促生赴科。張夫婦厚具贐禮送行。
　　生歸，端細詢前事，生備述始末之由，端大慟，生百喻之。端曰：「實妾令君帶書一節誤之。」生舉從卜並前相者「必招兩房」之言告之，以為事出不偶。端曰：「縱如此，汝必能如吾妹之所言，使娶之有名而無形跡，然後可也。」生曰：「予有一謀，能使吾父母之聽，但不知汝父母之心矣。」端曰：「汝試言之。」生曰：「予父母所憂者，惟在吾之子息。吾若多賂命相之士，令彼傳言『必娶偏房，方能招子』，那時可圖。」端曰：「君年尚幼，彼縱與娶，亦在從容。」生曰：「更令術者以夭促告之。」端乃徐曰：「君之所言，似有可行者，君試急謀之。君計若行，妾父母之事，妾當任之矣。」　
　　於是生一便治裝往試。一見術士，即厚賂之。及至科比，又高中，捷書飛報父母與端知。
　　生詞林戰捷，舉家歡忄六，大治筵宴，厚酬來使。及生回，賀客既散，術士盈門，言生之命相者，皆不足其壽數，且云「急娶偏房，方能招子。」生又托病，不欲會試。父果大懼，恐生夭折，自欲納妾。生母曰：「汝年高大，不可。今諸術士皆言國文必娶偏房，方能招子，不如令彼納之。」袞曰：「恐兒婦不允。」生母曰：「吾試與言之。」端初聞姑言，詐為不豫之色，及姑再三喻之，乃曰：「若然，必媳與擇，然後可也。」姑許之。端乃與生謀往父母之家。端至，父母大悅，謂曰：「汝郎發科，吾欲親賀，為路途不便，所以只遣禮來，心恒歉歉。今日何不與彼同來？」女長吁數聲。父母曰：「吾聞汝與郎有琴瑟之和，故令同來，今看汝長吁，無乃近有何言？」端以從在旁，且初到，但曰：「待明日言之。」　
　　端前者因從所寄之信，終疑其與生先有所私，每懷不足彼之心，及問香蘭，始知從確有所守，乃歎曰：「幸有此計可施，不然，令彼有終天之恨矣。」因令蘭相贊成。
　　時從猶不知端來之意，至夜，二人同寢，端舉以語之。從難言，潸然淚下。蘭在傍曰：「今謀已屬全，無瑣隙之可議。妾以為娘子聞此，實有非常之喜耳，何乃悲慘之深乎！」從抵目言曰：「策固然矣，當以予一人之失貽累於眾。且縱得諸父母之聽，亦非其本意。予所以苟養性命而不即死者，恐此心不白，愈起群疑，惡名萬世，故不得已而圖此萬萬不幸也。不幸之事，誰則喜之！」端亦為之感泣，更闌方寢。
　　次日，父母復問端長吁之故，端告以生納妾之事。張曰：「彼年尚幼，何有此舉？汝不必憂，吾當阻之。」端曰：「不可。此非郎之意，乃舅姑卜郎之命，必娶偏房，方能招子，故有是舉。今勢已成，則不能阻。不孝有三，無後為大，又不當阻。」張曰：「然則何以處之？」端欲言囁嚅。父母曰：「何難於言也？」端曰：「恐不見聽，故不敢言。」父母曰：「汝但言之，無不汝納。」端曰：「他無所言，但恐彼納妾之後，時馳歲去，端色既衰，彼婦生子，郎心少變，所求不得，動相掣肘，不免白首之歎。端細視此郎前程萬里，福澤悠長，阿妹尚未納親，欲令父母以妹妻之，使端無後日之憂，二氏有綿綿之好，不亦長便乎！」張曰：「吾家豈有作妾之女！」端曰：「姊妹之間，有何彼此。」張不答。端見父不聽，掩哭入內。
　　張見端如此，雖不彼聽，心亦甚憂，蘭因曰：「娘子初至，何不權且許之，與她閒樂幾時，待她回日，又作區處。」張曰：「此事豈可兒戲！」蘭曰：「既然如此，妾觀二娘子，數時諸宦家相求，彼皆欲卜之，不肯輕許，豈肯與人作妾乎？何不令她自與她說，那時她見二娘子不允，自不能啟口，而亦不得怨尤相公與夫人矣。」張夫婦曰：「此說較可。」因令蘭喚端，謂曰：「吾兒不須憂悶，我二人俱依汝說，汝更要自與汝妹商量，她若不允，我二人亦難強之。」端偽曰：「此事她知，決不肯從，只在父母決之。」張曰：「此彼事也，任彼主之。」因喚從出，謂曰：「汝姊欲說汝作妾，可否，汝自裁之。」從語端曰：「事繫終身，不敢輕議。自彼人喪後，人來議親，妹誓不問妻妾，惟如卜者，即納之。阿姊之言，亦惟卜之而已。」父母以前卜許多，皆未准，這次豈即如卜？亦贊言令卜之。
　　是夜，端、從、蘭三人同居房中，詐言所卜已吉，從已許之，報知與張，張笑曰：「吾特寬汝之憂，卜豈能定乎？此事斷然不可。」　
　　端思無由得父之聽，乃與從臥幽房中，令香蘭詐言其「數日絕食，肌膚消瘦。」母心惶懼，苦勸於張。張亦重生才德，思欲許之，又嫌為妾，將欲不許，恐女生變，二者交戰胸中，狐疑莫決。
　　生作會諸友亦聞其事，乃相率詣張，陰與贊成，且曰：「堯以二女妻舜，後世稱傳，皆雲盛事，孰得以此而少之？」張曰：「諸賢之言固有然者，但此舉實出小女，非吾婿意也。一旦舉此，知者謂小女執性，委曲為之；不知者，將以老夫為趨炎之輩矣。今必俟彼自有悃求之誠，然後再作定議也。」　
　　諸友退乃密修書寄生，備述張有允意，但得遣人造求，可諧其事。生以友書呈於父母，詐言以為不可。袞曰：「此汝岳父盛意，子若卻之，是不恭矣。可即遣媒妁往求，不宜遲滯。」生乃復書，轉浼諸友婉為作伐。
　　諸友復造於張，述生遠浼之意。張疑其詐，覺有難色。諸友乃出生書示之。張細認字跡，果婿所寄，又見書中言辭懇曲，不得已，乃曰：「小婿若有此舉，又承諸賢過諭，禮當從命。但我單生二女，不宜俱令遠離，況且春試在即，要待小婿上京應試連捷回來，那時送小女於歸未遲。」友即以張言語生。
　　生知岳父親事已成，欣然稟於父母，連夜抵京。三場試罷，復登甲第，賜入翰林。生思若在翰林，無由完聚，乃以親老為名，上表辭官。天子覽奏，嘉其克孝，准與終養。
　　及回，父母備禮，俟生親迎。張生妝資畢具。府縣聞知，各具禮儀，金鼓衛送。觀者如簇，莫不賞羨。惟從眉峰鎖納，默默無聊而已。端知其意，於夜乃置酒靜室，共敘疇昔，以解其悶。席間，端曰：「此夜雖已完聚，但揆厥所由，實我寄書一節以啟其釁，因作《西江月》一首以自責曰：
　　女是無瑕之璧，男為有室之人。今朝不幸締姻盟，此過深當予病。《記》雲『內外不謹』，軻書『授受不親』。無端特令寄佳音，以致針將線引。
　　從曰：「實妹不合私饋蘭花，以致如此。與阿姊何與？」亦作詩一首以自責曰：
　　杜宇啼春徹悶懷，南窗倚處見蘭開。
　　清芳擬共松筠老，紫莖甘同桃李偕。
　　聽羨欲投君所好，追思反作妾懸媒。
　　幾回惆悵愁無奈，懶向人前把首抬。
　　生曰：「二卿之言，固有然也。然以閉門拒嫠婦者處之，豈有此失？此實予之不德而貽累於卿也。」遂作《長相思》詞一首以謝之。詞曰：
　　感芳卿，謝芳卿，重見　娥與女英。二德實難禁。相也靈，卜也靈，姻緣已締舊時盟。還疑宿世情。
　　又詩一首以為慰云：
　　配合都來宿世緣，前非滌卻總休言。
　　稱名未正心雖愧，屬意惟堅人自憐。
　　莫把微瑕尋破綻，且臨皓魄賞團圓。
　　靈台一點願無恙，任與詩人作話傳。
　　是夜完聚之後，倏忽間又輕數載。天子改元，舊職俱起敘用。生與端、從同歷任所。二十餘年，官至顯宦，大小褒封，致政歸田。
　　端後果無所出，惟從生一子，事端曲盡其孝。夫婦各享遐齡。時無以知其事者，惟蘭備得其詳，逮後事人，以語其夫，始揚於外。予得與聞，以筆記之。不揣愚陋，少加敷演，以傳其美，遂名之曰《雙卿筆記》云。
第六卷    
　　花神三妙傳　
　　至正辛西三月暮春，花發名園，一段異香來繡戶；鳥啼綠樹，數聲嬌韻入畫堂。正是修日良辰，風光雅麗；浴沂佳候，人物繁華。時兵寇蕩我郊原，鄉人薦居城邑。紛紛霧雜，皆貴顯之王孫；濟濟雲從，悉英豪之國士。
　　江南俊傑白姓諱景雲，字天啟，別號潢源者，崇文學士裔孫，荊州別駕公子也。雅抱與春風並暢，丰姿及秋水同清。正弱冠之年，列黌宮之選，抱騎龍之偉志，負倚馬之雄才。乘此明媚朔朝，獨步烏山絕頂，吟詩一首曰：
　　玉樹迎風舞，枝枝射漢宮；
　　餘襟猶染翠，飛袖想綾紅。
　　海闊龍吟水，山高鳳下空；
　　瑤天羅綺閣，獨上聘閬風。
　　於是登書云之台，入凌虛之閣。適有三姬在廟賽禱明神，絕色佳人，世間罕有。溫朱顏以頂禮，露皓齒而陳詞。一姬衣素練者，年約十九餘齡，色賽三千宮貌，身披素服，首戴碧花，蓋西子之淡妝，正文君之新寡；愁眉嬌蹙，淡映春雲，雅態幽閒，光凝秋水，乃斂躬以下拜，願超化夫亡人。一姬衣綠者，容足傾城，年登十七，華髻飾玲瓏珠玉，綠袍雜雅麗鶯花，露綻錦之絳裙，恍新妝之飛燕；輕移蓮步深深拜，微啟朱唇款款言；蓋為親宦游，願長途多慶，一姬衣紫者，年可登乎十五，容尤麗於二妹，一點唇朱，即櫻桃之久熟；雙描眉秀，疑御柳之新鉤；金蓮步步流金，玉指纖纖露玉；再拜且笑，無祝無言，白生門外視久，而不能定情，突入參神，祈諧所願，三姬見其進之遽也，各以扇掩面而笑焉。生遂致恭，姬亦答禮。
　　姬各退，生尾隨。乃知衣素練者，趙富賈第四女名錦娘。世居烏山，嚴父先逝，錦適於鄭，半載夫亡，附母寡居，茲將二紀也。衣綠綃者，李少府長女，名瓊姐。父任辰州，念母年老，留瓊於家奉事祖母也。衣紫羅者，中督府參軍次女，名奇姐。父卒於宦，母已榮封，家資甚殷，下唯幼弟。時瓊、奇居遠城外，因避寇借居趙家，與錦娘為姨表之親，故朝夕相與盤桓者也。三姬見生之豐采，有顧盼情。白生見姬之芳顏，有留戀意。既知所在，遂策於心，因僦趙之左屋附居，乃得與三姬為鄰。
　　趙女微知生委曲之情，而春心已動。白生既得附趙女之室，而逸興遄飛，因吟長短句一首云：
　　十分春色蝶浮沉，錦花含笑值千金；
　　瓊枝戛玉揚奇音，雅調大堤恣狂吟。
　　豔麗芙蓉動君心。動君心，何時賞；
　　願作比翼附連枝，有朝飛繞巫山峰。
　　於時投刺比鄰，結拜趙母，遂締錦娘為妹，而錦亦以兄禮待生。然趙母莊嚴，生亦莫投其隙。
　　一日，母和寒疾，生以子道問安，逕步至中堂。錦娘正獨坐，即欲趨避。生急進前，曰：「妹氏知我心乎？多方為爾故也。予獨無居而求鄰貴府乎？予獨無母而結拜尊堂乎？此情倘或見諒，糜骨亦所不辭。」錦娘曰：「寸草亦自知春，妾豈不解人意？但幽嫠寡妹，何堪薦侍英豪；慈母嚴明，安敢少違禮法。」生曰：「崔夫人亦嚴謹之母也，卓文君亦幽嫠之妻也。」生言猶未終，忽聞戶外有履聲，錦娘趨入中閨，生亦入母寢室問病。母托以求醫，生奉命而出。復至敘話舊處，久立不見芳容，生懊恨而去。
　　詰朝，生迎醫至，三姬咸在。見生，轉入罘後，不見玉人容矣。生大悒怏，歸作五言古詩一首云：
　　巫山多神女，歌舞瑤台邊；
　　雲雨不可作，空餘楊柳煙。
　　芙蓉迷北岸，相望更淒然；
　　何當一攀折，醉倒百花前。
　　翌日，生奉藥至，遇錦娘於東階，不覺神魂飄蕩，口不能言。錦駭曰：「兄有恙乎？」生搖頭。又曰：「兄勞頓乎？」復搖首。錦曰：「何往日春風滿面，今日慘黛盈顏耶？」生良久曰：「吾為妹，病之深矣，神思任飛越矣。若妹無拯援之心，將索我於地下矣。」錦笑曰：「兄有相如之情，妾豈無文君之意？但春英、秋英日侍寢所，莫得其便；瓊姐、奇姐、繡房聯壁，舉動悉知。我為兄圖之：兄但勤事吾母，若往來頻速，或有間可投。」生前拽其袖，錦斂步而退，擲帕於地。生拾而藏之，進藥母前。母呼錦至，謂曰：「如此重勞大哥，汝當深深拜謝。」女微哂而拜，生含笑而答。復索炭烹藥，女亦奉火以從。白生以目送情，錦娘亦以秋波頻盼。兩情飄蕩，似翠柳之醉薰風；一意潛孚，恍曉花之凝滴露。蓋形雖未接，而神已交矣。藥既熟，女嘗，進母。生在背後戲褰其裳，女轉身怒目嗔視。生即解意。告歸。女因送出，責曰：「兄舉動不斂，幾敗乃事。倘慈闈見之，何顏復入乎？昨日之帕，兄當見還，倘若轉泄於人，俾妾名節掃地。」生曰：「吾深悔之，更不復然。」遂各辭歸，兩地悒怏。
　　自此，女會繡幃，齧指沉吟，神煩意亂，寢食不安。日間勉強與二妹笑言，夜來神魂唯白生眷戀。生亦無心經史，坐臥注意錦娘，口念有百千遍，腸數已八九回，每欲索筆題詩，不得句矣。因屢候母興居，往來頗見親密；雖數次與錦相遇，終莫能再敘寒溫。
　　一日，生至中堂，四顧皆無人跡，遂直抵錦娘寢室。適彼方悶坐停繡。生遇錦娘，一喜一懼；錦見白生，且駭且愕。生興發，不復交言，遂前進摟抱求合。正半推半就之際，聞春英堂上喚聲，女急趨母室，生脫身逃歸。此時錦不自覺，瓊姐已陰知之矣，題詩示奇姐曰：　
　　　蛺蝶採黃英，花心未許開；大風吹蝶去，花落下瑤台。
　　奇姐帶笑亦和以詩曰：　
　　　蝶為尋芳至，花猶未向開；春英妒玉蝶，摧倒百花台。
　　因曰：「此生膽大如斗」。瓊曰：「此必先與四姊有約，吾姊妹當作磨兜堅（即謹言也）可也。」　
　　白生錦娘佳會　
　　翌夕，生入候母，錦見，尚有赧容。生坐片時，因母睡熟，生即告錦，錦送至堂，天色將昏，杳無人跡。錦與生同入寢所，倉卒之間，不及解衣，摟抱登牀，相與歡會。斯時也，無相禁忌，恣生所為。秋波不能凝，朱唇不能啟，昔猶含羞色，今則逞嬌容矣。正是：春風入神髓，嫋娜嬌嬈夜露滴。芳顏融融，懨悒罷戰，整容而起。錦娘不覺長吁，謂生曰：「妾之名節，盡為兄喪。不為柏舟之烈，甘赴桑間之期，良可期也，君其憐之。但此身已屬之君，願生死不忘此誓。兄一戒漏泄，戒棄捐，何如？」生曰：「得此良晤，如獲珠琳，持之終身，永為至寶。」意欲求終夜之會，錦以侍女頻來為辭，且曰：「再為兄圖之，必諧通契約也。」因送生出，則明月在天矣。闔扉而入，靜想片時，方憶瓊姐、奇姐聞知，惶愧措躬無地。自是結納二妹，必欲同心。，　
　　瓊姐長於詩章，錦娘精於刺繡，昔時針法稍秘，至是女工盡傳。奇姐茂年，天成聰敏，學錦刺繡，學瓊詩章，無不得其精妙，遂為勿逆之交。錦之侍女春英，瓊之侍女新珠，奇之侍女蘭香，向皆往來香閨，各皆以計脫去。此錦娘之奇策，實為生之深謀。
　　此自母病既痊，生亦盛儀稱慶，仍厚賂童僕及諸比鄰，事不外揚。皆無疑忌，因得鎮日來往，終夜與錦盡歡。
　　然瓊、奇二姬屬垣竊聽，雖其未湛春色，豈無盎然春情？中夜瓊姐長吁，錦知其情已動，暇間論及，錦挑之曰：「外間頗議白哥驕肆，自視之，亦然。」瓊姐曰：「豪門公子，年值青春，且風流人豪，文章魁首將來非登金馬院，則步鳳凰池，無惑其驕人也。」錦知其有愛重之及復曰：「白哥夜來有夢，與妹相會烏山。」瓊哂曰：「我本女流，渠是子，內言不出，況可同游？是何言也，不亦異乎！」錦撫掌而笑曰：「前言戲之耳。」　
　　是夕，錦與生密謀，作古詩一首曰：
　　綺閣見仙子，心心不忍忘。
　　東牆聽鶯語，一句一斷腸。
　　有意蟠芳草，多情傍綠楊。
　　何當垂清盼，解我重悲傷。
　　是以詩置瓊繡冊。瓊見，哂謂奇姐曰：「錦姐弄瓊妹乎！書生放筆花也。我若不即裁答，笑我裙釵無能。」乃次韻曰：
　　遊春在昔日，春去情已忘。
　　解笑花無語，看花枉斷腸。
　　自飛風外燕，自舞隔江楊。
　　芳節平勁草，誰憐游子傷。
　　瓊本與錦聯房，中間只隔障板，亦有門相達，但雖設常關耳。詩成，而生適來，因自板間傳遞。生見其詞，歎曰：「此瑯瑯妙句也，世間有此女乎！」乃援筆立答曰：
　　花貌已含笑，愛花情不忘；
　　黃金嫩顏色，一見斷人腸。
　　願結同心帶，相將舞綠楊；
　　相如奏神曲，千載共悲傷。
　　生亦於板間傳遞。瓊見之，哂曰：「白哥好逼人也，吾今不復答矣。」　
　　自是，生入試屆期，不暇復入錦堂。即日試畢，潛訪故人。錦既盡歡，生亦盡樂。中夜，謂錦曰：「細觀瓊姬，甚有美意。吾既得隴，又復望蜀，何如？」錦曰：「君獲魚兔，頓忘筌蹄矣。」生誓曰：「異日果有此心，七孔皆流鮮血。」錦曰：「聞君誓詞，痛焉如割。為君設策，事端可諧。」　
　　是夜，乘三更睡酣，潛開門，入瓊臥房，掀開帳衾。二姬睡熟，生按瓊玉肌潤澤，香霧襲人，皓白映光，照牀如晝。瓊側體向內而臥，生輕身斜倚相偎，唯恐睡醒，不敢輕犯。片晌，錦持被去，瓊陰知覺矣。錦笑謂生曰：「欲圖大事，膽無半分，然吾妹必醒，吾當往試。」錦至，而瓊已起，乃復巧說以情，瓊正色曰：「既不能以禮自處，又不能以禮處人！吾若隱忍不言，豈是守貞之女？若欲明之於母，又失姊妹之情。況吾等逃難，所以全軀，豈宜以亂易亂？」遂明蠟炬，乃呼奇姐，則奇已驚汗浹背，蒙被而眠矣。聞呼，猶自戰驚，見火，瞿然狂起。瓊笑曰：「汝不被盜尚然，何況我親見賊乎。」二人共坐，附耳細談，載笑載言，千嬌百媚。生在門隙竊視，真傾國傾城之容也。自此神思飄揚，無非屬意瓊姐。於時錦娘頗有逸興，因與白生就枕。生即慕瓊之雅趣，盡皆發洩於錦娘，搖曳歡謔多時。二女潛來窺視，少者猶或自禁，長者不能定情。
　　嗣是生慕瓊之意無窮，瓊念生之心不置。然瓊深自強制，不肯吐露真情，但每日常減餐，終宵多飲水，奇知其情，密以告錦。數日，身果不快，錦娘撫牀謂曰：「汝之病根，吾所素稔。姊妹深愛，何必引嫌？況吾翁即若翁，白丈非汝丈也？」瓊曰：「姊誤矣，豈謂是與！」　
　　居一二日，生來錦室。告以瓊病，生遂問安。奇姐避入帳後。錦拽生裾登牀，笑謂生曰：「好好醫吾妹。」錦呼瓊曰：「好好聽良醫。」錦因辭去。生留少坐。生問瓊病，笑而不答。奇帳後呼曰：「好與大哥細言，莫使夜來發熱。」瓊笑曰：「有時亦熱到汝。」生以玉簪授瓊姐，瓊以金簪復白生。生執手固請其期，瓊以指書「四月十日」。
　　至期，生至，又復不納。錦苦勸之，瓊厲聲曰：「汝等裝成圈套，絡我於中，吾不能從，有死而已。」生聞言興闌，錦亦含羞，而門遂閉。豈知其色厲而內和，言堅而情動，中夜窺顛鸞倒鳳之狀，遂爾發舞蝶游蜂之思，三次起欲扣門，害羞又復就枕，比生睡熟，扣扉不得開矣。頓增悒怏，神思昏沉。奇姐笑曰：「姐食楊梅，又怕齒酸，不食楊梅，又須口渴。今番錦姐不管，白哥不來，牢抱衾枕，長害相思也。」　
　　翌日，生偶以事見趙母，回至中堂，無人，因入錦娘寢所。瓊自門隙度詩與生曰：　玉華露液濃，侵我絞綃襪；神思已飄搖，中宵看明月。
　　生見詩亦答曰：
　　幾回拽花枝，露濕沾羅襪；今夜上天階，端擬拜新月。
　　錦娘曰：「瓊姐已無掛念，兄又不鑒覆車，徒使月老愁。此詩莫持去也。」奇姐窺視，笑曰：「今宵斷諧月老約矣。請四姐過此一議。」錦以詩度與瓊曰：「今夜若不諧，向後更不來。」瓊見詩，含笑目奇。奇與錦附耳久之。
　　是夕，生未晚膳，錦分發春英買備。紿趙母曰：「夏景初至，明月在天，姊妹三人意圖賞玩。」母喜而不疑，因益其肴饌，且戒婢僕曰：「汝輩無得混亂，與他姊妹盡歡。」因此固蔽重門，與生恣其歡謔，誠人間之極趣，百歲之奇逢也。
　　是夕，瓊姐盛妝，枕衾更以錦繡，爛熳似牡丹之向日，芬芳如芍藥之迎風。飲畢，奇姐密啟重門，直趨趙母寢室，紿以「不勝酒力，姊妹苦勸而逃」。趙母甚歡，因與共寢。瓊忽失奇所在，錦亦不勝驚惶。既知其詳，瓊方就枕，固執不解衣帶。生亦苦無奈何。錦隔房呼曰：「何不奮龍虎之雄，斷鴛鴦之帶乎？」生猶豫不忍。瓊苦告曰：「慕兄上識，非為風情，談話片時，足諧所願。若必採春花，頓忘秋實，兄亦何愛於妹，妹亦何取於兄乎！願兄以席上之珍自重，妹亦以石中之璞自珍，則兄為士中之英，妹亦為女流之杰。不爾，當自經以相謝耳。「生不得已，合抱同眠。玉體相偎，金枝不掛。中夜，生得請曰：「予為子斷肝腸矣。」瓊曰：「吾豈無人意，甘斷兄肝腸？但兩玉相偎，如魚得水，持此終身，予亦甚甘。何必弄玩形骸，惹人談笑？兄但以詩教妹，妹亦以詩答兄，斯文之交，勝如骨肉。」生曰：「自見芳卿，不勝動念，得伸幽會，才慰夙心。若更以枕席為辭，必以鬼幽相拒。」瓊曰：「妹亦知兄心，兄但體妹意。兄必索幽會，須待瓊再生。」生知其意不可回，乃口占五言古詩曰：
　　我抱月前興，誰憐月下悲；
　　空中雲輕過，遙望豈相宜。
　　千里神駒逸，誰能掛絡羈；
　　忍懷橫玉樹，無力動金枝。
　　高唱大堤曲，神妃不肯吹；
　　密雲迷歸路，際遇待何時。
　　相失齊飛雁，茫茫空爾思。
　　瓊亦口占答曰：
　　君識吾愛汝，那堪為汝悲；
　　春花莫摧折，掩映亦相宜。
　　神駿馳黃道，何須下羈絡；
　　飄飄月中樹，誰能剪一枝。
　　蘭橋歌舞路，且待曉風吹；
　　雲度橫碧海，春來也有時。
　　願至桃花候，油然為汝思。
　　生笑曰：「桃花，何時也？」瓊曰：「合巹之際耳。」生既意夕不寐，女亦終夜不眠。詩韻敲成，東方既白矣。
　　錦娘至，曰：「新人好眠，不知時侯耶？」生曰：「枉爾為月老，使我怨蒼天。」錦笑曰：「月老解為媒，能教汝作事耶？」瓊姐和衣而起，生亦長歎下牀。瓊對錦曰：「與白哥說一場清話，正快我敬仰之私。」錦曰：「何以謝媒？」瓊曰：「多謝，多謝！」又問生曰：「何以謝我？」生曰：「相見不相親，不如不相見；相親不知心，不如不相親。」及梳洗畢，固辭歸。瓊曰：「不必出去，妹有一樽敘情。繡房無人往來，哥哥不必深慮。」生曰：「早教我歸去也，勿磨我成枯魚。」錦娘曰：「吾妹真好力量，一宵人畏如此。」生曰：「不磨之磨，乃真磨也；無畏之畏，誠至畏也。」錦笑曰：「我備細聞知，兄真無大勇，坐好事多磨，而又何畏乎？」生曰：「掌上之珠，庭際之玉，玩弄令人自憐，何忍遽加摧挫。」時瓊方對鏡，錦為之畫眉，且謂曰：「我聞哥言，尚思軟心，汝之所為，太無人意。」瓊曰：「知過，知過。」　
　　少頃，奇姐入來，盛妝靚服，雲欲回家。拜錦娘曰：「暫別，暫別。」拜瓊姐曰：「恭喜，恭喜！」問曰：「哥哥去矣？」瓊曰：「尚留在此。」時生出見，奇亦拜辭。生曰：「適有一事，欲來相投，終夜無眠，肝腸盡斷。」奇笑不答，密謂瓊曰：「姐夫何出此言？」瓊以實告。奇笑曰：「姊姊如此固執，莫怪姐夫斷腸。」生在錦房，聞言突至，曰：「願妹垂憐，救我殘喘。」奇姐遜避無路，被生摟抱片時，求其訂盟，終不應。錦娘至曰：「吾妹年幼，未解雲雨，正欲告歸，兄勿驚動。」生方釋手。瓊撫其背曰：「阿姐且勿回家，我有一杯清敘。」奇嬌羞滿面，不能應聲。瓊戲之曰：「不食楊梅，今番齒軟矣。」因共出細談曰：「吾與賢妹，生死之交，向時同遇郎君，今豈獨享其樂耶？細觀此人，溫潤如玉，真國家之美器，天下之奇珍也。欲待不從，吾神已為所奪；若欲苟就，又恐羞臉難藏。妹若先歸，而吾亦去。妹歸雖堅白無瑕，吾去即枯槁憔悴。妹若有心，同此作伴。若必堅為貞女，豈忍吾染風流？」奇笑曰：「與姊同生同死，吾之盟也。與兄同歡同樂，非吾願也。但白哥風流才子，我愛之何啻千金。但非垂髮齊年，安敢蒹葭倚玉？姊當憐我，我且不歸，奉陪數時，少罄衷曲。」時瓊、奇方掩扉而入，春英卒然扣門曰：「老安人來送姐姐。」錦應曰：「我留此餞行。」生舔舌（音忝炎，吐舌貌。）曰：「幾誤事矣！」　
　　於是錦入見趙母，給以為奇送行。母曰：「幼女如嫩花，不可多勸酒。」於是入百花園內，相對盡飲。錦出令以勸瓊，奇勒瓊以盡飲。錦自稱「主婚大姊」，奇自號「年少冰人」。啐酒交歡，摘花相贈。瓊姐不勝酒力，頓覺神思沉酣。正是：竹葉綴三行，桃花浮兩臉；愈加嬌嫩，酷似楊妃矣。
　　白生瓊姐佳會　
　　時日方轉申，扶瓊就寢。生、錦為解羅帶，奇姐為布枕衾。瓊半醉半醒，妖香無那，謂生曰：「妾既醉酒，又得迷花，弱草輕盈，何堪倚玉？」生曰：「窈窕佳人，入吾肺腑，若更固拒，便喪微軀。」生堅意求歡。女兩手推送，曰：「妾似嫩花，未經風雨，若兄憐惜，萬望護持。」生笑曰：「非為相憐，不到今日。」生護以白帕，瓊側面無言。採掇之餘，猩紅點點；檢視之際，無限嬌羞。正是：一朵花英，未遇游蜂採取；十分春色，卻來舞蝶侵尋。
　　生於雲雨之時，未敢恣其逸興。只見：容如秋月，臉斜似半面　娥；神帶桃花，眉蹙似病心西子。錦衾漾秋水，嬌態襲人；玉露點白蓮，和風入骨。生欲採而女求罷採，女欲休而生未肯休。神思飛揚，如風之摶柳；形骸留戀，如漆之附膠。誠天下奇逢，世間佳遇。斯時錦、奇竊視，莫不毛骨竦然。生既戰休，瓊謂之曰：「妾生人世，落落此身，將圖結王謝之姻，不意見崔張之事。但微軀已托之兄，願終始如環不絕。」因以少時所佩玉環授生，永以為好。生曰：「此奇遇也，吾當作賦以紀之。」瓊曰：「與兄聯句何如？」生曰：「甚妙。」時天將暮矣，於是明豹膏之燭，索文房之寶，揭得「林」字韻。生為之首倡，曰：
　　爰朱明之佳候兮，花嬌笑於上林（白景雲）。風乍和而乍暖兮，黃鶯巧調夫奇音（李瓊姐）。茲良辰之可愛兮，展予布於花陰（白）。怨中閨之寂寥兮，憎飛蝶之侵尋（李）。予登瑤台以盼望兮，撫求凰之素琴（白）。修予容於鸞鏡兮，飾環佩於綠襟（李）。上憑虛之綺閣兮，見絕色之奇琛（白）。與英豪而乍遇兮，擬天上之球琳（李）。緣秋波之轉盼兮，飄蕩子之芳心（白）。彼飄飄之元白兮，托孤鳳以悲吟（李）。凴欄百種情思兮，橫憂懷之感慨（白）。守深閨以困念兮，亦凌風而顧影（李）。比天上之嫦娥兮，虞空思夫畫餅（白）。亮中外之靡同兮，徒鬱憂而自省（李）。謝月老之勤渠兮，登予身於巫山之嶺（白）。朱履之遇金釵兮，慚花容之載整（李）。感芳卿之憐予兮，傍日邊之紅杏（白）。君似彩蝶戀花兮，舞正陽之美景（李）。弄珠環於掌中兮，緬此生之何幸（白）。抱席上之奇珍兮，羞芳情之欲逞（李）。問予二人其何若兮，擬桃源之遇劉（白）。亦似文魚比目兮，深芳沼之清流（李）。賽連枝之琪樹兮，偎玉骨於青丘（白）。斜據胡牀吟詠兮，宛銀河之女牛（李）。並頭蓮花似汝與我兮，開菡萏於芳洲（白）。羅帶同心共結兮，不解夫千秋萬秋（李）。指九天以為誓兮，情方鍾而思悠悠（白）。願以指日為正兮，吐誓詞而含羞（李）。千金難買此良晤兮，誠人世之所好逑（白）。緣自天之五百兮，今夕諧此鸞儔（李）。軟玉溫香在手兮，身外更有何求（白）？作賦致祝兮，幸無使妾歎白頭（李）。
　　詞賦既成，各書其一，女制二錦囊藏之。時樵鼓三更，瓊倦而就枕矣。
　　生共枕片時，乃曰：「吾去謝冰人，免叫她嗔恨。」遂開錦娘之戶，上鏤金之牀。時錦睡酣，被生驚覺，曰：「適自何來，遽集於此？今番月老功效何如？」生具陳初終，不敢隱寂。錦曰：「吾悉聞矣，試君心耳。」生因求歡。錦固辭謝，曰：「妾聞人亦有言，一座豈有兩主？」生笑曰：「非魏無知，臣安得進？」錦曰：「冠玉之英，亦不背本。」因與之久謔。錦附耳曰：「奇妹功亦不少，彼在東牀獨宿，兄可著意懇求，機會不可錯過。」　
　　時奇已醒。只得詐睡。奈生興如狂，刻意求歡。奇幸著裡衣，力以死拒，然形神雖未媾合，而骸骨亦盡偎依矣。牢抱甚久，堅守不從。生固請具期，奇答曰：「後會有曰。」生苦懇，無奈何奇哀告不已。錦恐聲跡外揚，乃起，勸生釋手。
　　生既終夜不寐，不勝困倦，乃復就枕片時，趙家已進早膳。起而梳洗，以計脫歸，不及告辭。瓊甚悒怏，相送惶惶，淚傾春雨。瓊既為生切念，又復為奇縈懷，寢食不安，衷腸悶損，唯錦娘調諧左右，曾莫得其歡心者矣。
　　三妙寄情唱和　
　　是日，奇姐遣侍女蘭香至，瓊姐題七言古詩一首，密封付之。詩名《飛雁曲》：
　　日斜身傍彩雲遊，雲去蕭然誰與伴；不見月中抱月人，淚珠點滴江流滿。並頭鴻雁復無情，不任聯飛各分散；莫往莫來繫我思，片片柔腸都想斷。
　　奇讀其詩，不覺長歎。母問其故，權辭答曰：「大姊病躁渴，欲求我藥方。」母曰：「明早即令蘭香送去，不可失信於人。」奇乃步韻制詩，翌日送去。詩曰：
　　彩雲昨夜繞瓊枝，千秋萬秋長作伴；
　　舉首青天即可邀，何須淚灑江流滿。
　　江頭打鴨鴛鴦驚，飛北飛南暫分散；
　　歸來不見月中人，任是無情腸亦斷。
　　瓊見之，不覺掩淚。錦讀之，亦發長歎曰：「二妹皆奇才，天生雙女士也。」然錦亦通文史，但不會作詩，生稱為「女中曾子固。」至是，瓊強之和。錦笑曰：「吾亦試為之，但作五言而已。」詩曰：
　　巫山雲氣濃，玉女長為伴；
　　而今遠飛揚，相望淚流滿。
　　襄王時來游，風伯忽吹散；
　　歸雁亦多情，音書猶未斷。
　　瓊見錦詩，曰：「四姊好手段，向來只過謙，若遇白郎來，同心共唱和矣。」錦曰：「貽笑大方耳。」　
　　適生令小僮奉楊梅與趙母，錦問曰：「大叔安在？」答曰：「往鄉才回。」瓊將錦詩密封與生，生意其即瓊所為也。是夕，二姬度生必至。
　　生乘黑而至，瓊且喜且怒，罵曰：「郎非雲中人也，乃是花前蝶耳！花英未採，去去來來；花英既採，一去不來。錦囊聯句，還我燒之！」生曰：「我若負心，難逃雷劍，實因家事，無可奈何。向來新詞，卿所制乎？」瓊曰：「四姊新制。」生曰：「曾子固能作詩乎？」瓊曰：「向來只謙遜耳。」生對錦曰：「承教，承教！」錦曰：「獻笑，獻笑！」生曰：「末二句何也？」瓊曰：「為二姐耳。」因道其由，及出瓊奇二作。生曰：「三姬即三妙矣。」瓊笑曰：「四人真四美也。」生曰：「吾當奉和新詩，但適遠歸勞頓，求一瞌睡，少息片時。」錦曰：「請臥大妹之房，以便謝罪。」瓊曰：「請即四姊之榻，亦可和詩。」二人相推，久而不決。錦良久曰：「妾已久沐深波，妹猶未嘗真味。決當先讓，再無疑焉。」生乃攜瓊登牀。是夕，稍加歡謔，然亦未騁芳情也。罷戰之後，瓊謂之曰：「奇妹與吾共患難，結以同生死。今為愛兄，失此良友，兄妹之情雖得，朋友之義乖矣。」生曰：「吾見三姬，均所注意，由此達彼，良有是心，但苦情為卿，方才入手，又思及彼，非越分妄求乎！況此女未動芳心，又堅寧耐，是以不敢強。卿何以為謀耶？」瓊曰：「此女心情比吾更脫，若馴其德性，猶易為謀。但恐見機不復來此，若更再至，易以圖矣。且學刺而麗線無雙，學詩而妍詞可取，真女中英也。」因誦其《拜秋月詩》曰：
　　盈盈秋月在中天，今夜人人拜秋月；
　　高照地天今古明，看破千山萬山骨。
　　清輝不減度年華，光陰轉眼如超忽；
　　我心我心月自知，勿使青春負華髮。
　　生歎曰：「奇才，奇才！恨不肯相倡和耳。」須臾，生起，與錦交歡。錦久待情濃，乃恣生歡晤。錦於得趣之際，未免囀出嬌聲，雖懼為瓊所聞，然亦不能自禁矣。
　　次日，兵報戒嚴，狂寇肆集，瓊、奇家眷，填滿趙家。生欲入無門，乃紿於趙母曰：「母有重壁，與兒為鄰，欲寄小箱，未得其便。乞鑿一小門相通，庶篋笥便於寄頓。」母愛生如子，遂言無不從。生即得計，即制小門，自此可達瓊房，晝夜往來甚便。錦娘亦謂趙母曰：「兒居幽嫠，不宜見客。今逃寇人眾，閒往雜來，願西邊諸門，兒自關鎖。不用童僕，自主爨燎，與二妹共甘苦，俟寇定再區處。」母曰：「正是如此。」此二計可比良、平，任蘇、張莫測其秘矣。
　　奇姐自歸後想生甚切，吟一絕曰：
　　巫山舊枕處，那堪臨別時；雲卿頻入夢，何日敘佳期？　　
　　此日復至，瓊喜不勝，問奇曰：「別後思姊否？」奇曰：「深思，深思。」又曰：「思白兄否？」曰：「不思，不思。」瓊曰：「何忍心若是？」奇曰：「他與我無干。」瓊曰：「吾妹已染半藍。」奇曰：「任他涅而不緇。」大笑而罷。午後，因檢繡冊，得見前詩，指之曰：「不思白兄，乃想佳期耶？」奇笑曰：「久與姊別，思敘佳期耳。」瓊笑曰：「吾妹錯矣。男婦相會，是為佳期。本思雲卿，如何推阻？」奇曰：「但思何妨？」瓊曰：「吾為妹成之。」奇曰：「大姊不須多事。」瓊曰：「恐妹又害相思。」奇曰：「我從來不飲冷水。」瓊曰：「汝今番要食楊梅。」復大笑而罷。
　　是夕，趙母請奇敘別，瓊推病不行。生自重壁而至，唯見瓊姐在房，握手求歡，再三固拒。生曰：「初開重壁，適邇啟行，若欲空歸，恐非吉利。」因和衣一會，瓊赧赧羞容也。因述奇芳情，且誦其佳句，乃獻策曰：「今夜二更時候，兄當過此重門，牢抱鴛鴦，勿使飛去。」因附耳細語。生曰：「吾已諭矣。」生暫歸家。奇亦飲罷入房，謂瓊曰：「今夜我別處睡，只恐白郎復來。」瓊曰：「此時人亂如麻，白郎永不能至，若欲有心相見，除非夜半夢中。」奇不知重壁可通，只將錦房門固鎖，乃曰：「今夜任白郎至，不能過此門矣。」悉解衣，與瓊共臥，懷抱如交頸鴛鴦。
　　夜半，奇姐睡熟，生自重壁而入。奇半醒半睡，以為即瓊也。及蝶至花前，乃始驚覺。生曲盡蟠龍之勢，奇嗔作舞鳳之形，生亦無奈。奇曰：「哥且放手，我非固辭，但瓊姐相會勸渠，我豈獨甘草率？」生曰：「何以為誓？」奇曰：「今宵若肯就，必早赴幽冥；明日若負心，終為泉下鬼。」錦瓊呼曰：「兄真無力量，今番又復空行。」奇曰：「姊姊逼人。」因以首撞牀柱，生急抱持，穩睡至天明，含羞不起，瓊再三開諭，乃斂容下牀。時生已去，瓊問：「今宵之約何如？」奇笑面點首。
　　是日，三姬皆盛妝，生為開佳宴。日前，生僦趙室，俱無一人居住；母親從父宦游，生亦議婚未娶，因此得恣逸游。邀姬重壁過去，設案，當天詛盟。是時誓詞，皆錦代制。錦先制姊妹三人告詞，遂命拜參，當天焚奏。其詞曰：
　　維辛酉四月十九日，同心人趙錦娘、李瓊姐、陳奇姐，虔上明香，上告月府之神曰：「竊以女生人世，魂托月華，是太陰之精靈，實微軀之司命也。錦等三人，締為姊妹，如負前之誓，決受月斧之誅。明月在天，俯垂照鑒。
　　又制與生同盟告詞，羅列展拜，上告穹蒼。其詞曰：
　　維重光作噩之歲，正陽日旦之時，同心人白景雲、趙錦娘、李瓊姐、陳奇姐，皆結髮交也。荷天意之玉成，諒月老之注定。男若負女，當天而骨露形銷；女若負男，見月而魂亡魄化。煌煌月府，皎皎照臨。
　　白生奇姐佳會　
　　是夕，四人共歡，三鼓罷宴，瓊、奇先歸繡房，生、錦共撤肴饌。
　　奇含羞縮，欲背前言，瓊曰：「盟誓在前，豈敢相負？」奇執瓊手，曰：「真個羞人！將奈之何？」瓊為撤去金花，奇又不解羅帶。瓊笑曰：「吾妹有何福德，起動十七歲小姐作媒婆耶？妹夫來矣，衣帶快解。」生亦突至，奇笑而從，因蒙被而眠。瓊視生曰：「慎勿輕狂，嫩花初吐也。」生笑而登牀，只見雲雨之際，一段甘香，人間未有，但略點化，即見猩紅，生取而驗之。奇轉身遽起，謂生曰：「十五載養成，為兄所破，何顏見吾母乎！皆姊姊誤我也。」生細細溫存，輕輕痛惜，待意稍動，乃敢求歡。奇曰：「只此是矣，何必復然？」生曰：「此是採花，未行雲雨。二姬雅態，妹所悉聞，若不盡情，即喪吾命。」奇不得已，乃復允從。但見芳心雖動，花蕊未開；驟雨初施，何堪忍耐。乍驚乍就，心欲進而不能；萬阻千推，口欲言而羞縮。愁眉重蹙，半臉斜偎。鴛枕推捱，頓覺蓬松雲鬢；玉肌轉輾，好生不快風情。雖其嬌態之固然，亦其花英之未滿。生亦輕試，未敢縱行，但得半開，已為至願。須臾雲散，香汗如珠，蓋其相愛之情固根於肺腑，而含羞之態自露於容顏。固問真情，再三不應，貼胸交股而臥，不覺樵鼓三更。
　　瓊姐舉燈來，曰：「吾妹得無倦乎？」生興大發，拽瓊登牀，盡展其未展之趣。瓊亦樂其快樂之情，真盎然滿面春，不復為嬌羞態矣。既罷，奇變曰：「姊姊得無倦乎？」瓊曰：「但不如妹之苦耳。」三人笑謔，忽爾睡酣，日晏不起。奇姐之母，陳氏夫人也，在外扣門甚急。錦忙速喚，三人乃醒。生自重壁逃去，尤幸夫人不覺。瓊因紿之曰：「五更起女工，因倦，適就枕耳。」夫人諭奇姐曰：「汝與大姊雖表姊妹，患難相倚，當如同胞，須宜勤習女工，不可妄生是非，輕露頭面。昨趙姨欲汝三人同爨，不令女僕往來，此習勤儉一端，吾亦聞之自喜。」少頃，瓊姐母亦至，見此二姬猶未梳洗，責瓊曰：「雞鳴梳頭，女流定例。此時尚爾，何可見人！」瓊曰：「五更起女工，因倦，復就枕耳。」二母信之而回，瓊、奇膽幾破矣。
　　奇深懊恨，瓊亦赧然，相對無言，臨鏡不樂。奇曰：「自今痛改前過。」瓊曰：「我亦大覺昨非。」錦隔牆呼曰：「只恐白郎來，芳心又依舊矣。」奇曰：「四姊固功之首，亦罪之魁。」錦笑曰：「吾罪誠深，須宜出首。」奇曰：「姊首何人？」錦曰：「專首二姐。」奇曰：「有何可據？」錦曰：「詩句尚存。」瓊曰：「我與汝姊妹連和，從今作清白世界。」錦笑曰：「江漢以濯之，不可清也；秋陽以暴之，不可白也。」奇曰：「我當入侍慈母，不理許多閒非。」錦曰：「不過三五更，復想敘佳期矣。」奇不覺發笑。錦娘啟扉而入，曰：「我欲為白哥制雙履，願二妹共樂成。」瓊曰：「謹依來命。」奇曰：「吾弗能也。」錦曰：「吾妹尚未知趣，他日偏爾向前。」共笑而罷。於是錦娘制履，二妹協功，日暮倦勤，共成聯句，推瓊首倡，為五言排律云：
　　四月未明候（李），陽和乍雨天。榴花紅噴火（趙），荷葉綠鋪錢。公子游瓊苑（陳），奇英奉碧泉；柳暗迷歸路（李），花香透坐筵。雲鐘敲清韻（趙），錦瑟奏初弦；意馬牢牢繫（陳），心猿蕩蕩牽。多情慵針線（李），得趣賦詩編；蛺蝶台前舞（趙），鴛鴦水上連。願為連理樹（陳），合作並頭蓮；信誓深銀海（李），風流滿玉川。文君如可作（趙），司馬亦稱賢；為制綠雙履，高高步紫煙（陳）。
　　錦笑曰：「二姐口硬似鐵，心軟如綿。」奇曰：「何以知之？」錦曰：「看詩便知。」奇笑曰：「君子戲言，不可戲筆。」瓊笑曰：「可是，可是。」是夜，生以朋友邀飲，不至。三姬無限惶惶，坐至四更方登牀，比至雞鳴，起梳洗矣。
　　生醉醒，不勝痛恨。清晨，即詣瓊房，冀圖一會，告以衷情。不意三姬各去候母。生疑事機漏泄，又懼心志變遷，題詩示瓊曰：
　　酩酊不知夜，醒來恨殺人；洞門空久坐，不見百花春。
　　生坐久，不見三姬，又欲候文宗揭曉，悵悵而去。
　　瓊歸，見詩，笑曰：「白郎夜來被酒，今朝無限惶惶。」奇笑曰：「他醉由他醉，我醒還自醒。」錦笑曰：「昨宵既已醉酒，今夜必定迷花。」少頃，家僮來報。「文宗發案。」趙母令人去探消息。三姬相對深思，側耳欲聞真信。久之，奇笑曰：「白哥既有探花手段，必有折桂才能。此行決應高選，不須姊姊猜疑。」瓊笑曰：「汝是座上觀音，說話自然靈聖。」錦笑曰：「他只一夜夫妻，識破十年學問矣。」奇帶羞含笑，時午膳猶未畢，家僮入報趙母曰：「白家大叔考居優等矣。」趙母甚喜，來報三姬。錦、瓊俱目奇，奇亦帶冷笑。
　　趙母既退，錦、瓊戲掖奇上坐，曰：「阿妹真觀音也，每事拜而問焉。」歡笑而罷。是日黃昏時候，白生歸，入見趙母，因請見李老夫人及陳夫人。夫人曰：「好個清俊秀才，他日必成偉器。」生以所賞銀花獻之趙母。趙母分賜三姬，各妝為士寶花勝。奇姐一枝，尤加巧麗。瓊姐戲以詞曰（名《憶王孫》）：
　　　娥神已屬王孫，坐對花神久斷魂，燕語鶯聲不忍聞。想越黃昏，花勝鮮妍獨倚門。
　　四美連牀夜雨　
　　是夕，入三姬之室，談笑盡歡，不覺譙樓起鼓。錦對瓊曰：「二姐尚未知趣，今夜當使盡情。」乃一與白郎解衣，一與奇姐解裙，勒之共臥。奇姐固辭。錦曰：「自此以始，先小後大，以此為序，勿相推辭。」生然之。但見輕憐痛惜，細語護持。女須有深情，但未堪任重，花心半動，桃口含芳，生略動移，即難忍耐。生曰：「但喚我作檀郎，吾自當釋手。」奇固推遜，生進益深。奇不得已，曰：「才郎且放手。」生被奇痛惜數言，不覺真情盡矣。相抱睡熟，漏下三鼓。
　　錦來，呼曰：「瓊姐相候多時，如何甘心熟睡？」生與錦去，即登瓊榻。瓊曰：「願君安息片時，相與談話為樂。」因詢奇佳興，生細道真情。瓊聞言心動，生雅興彌堅，於是復為蜂蝶交。及罷，瓊謂生曰：「君為妾困倦如斯，妾不忍君即去，但錦姐虛席已久，君其將奈之何？」時錦立在牀前，摟抱同去，相對極歡。
　　錦風月之態甚嬌，生雲雨之情亦動，在生已知錦之興濃，在錦唯懼生之情泄。謂生曰：「君風力甚佳，妾意欲已足，但欲姊妹為同牀之會，不知君意何如？」生曰：「此是人間之極歡，但恐二妹不允從耳。」錦曰：「吾紿之使來，然後以情語之耳。」　
　　於是，錦紿瓊曰：「白郎適來發熱，如何是了？」瓊方醒覺，聞言戰懼，即起問安，被生摟定，乃告以錦意。瓊只得曲從。錦復紿奇曰：「白哥滿身發熱，瓊姊在彼問安，汝何昏睡，不痛念乎？」奇曰：「今奈之何？」錦曰：「去問安便是。」奇遽起索衣，不得其處。錦曰：「快去，快去！夜暮無妨。」適至牀前，被生摟抱，只得曲從。生刻意求歡，三姬推讓不決。生銳意向錦，錦辭曰：「欲不可縱，樂不可極，向愛二妹妙句，兄當與之聯詩，使妾得以與聞，亦生平之至願也。」生曰：「妙甚。」即牀上口吟，生為首倡。曰：
　　君不見瑤台高映碧天東（白），珠璣璀璨玉玲瓏（趙）。又不見襄王朝來飛白馬（李），日暮又復跨青騎（陳）。乍雲乍雨迷花月（白），羅襟飄搖揚輕風（趙）。沉香亭北花盈砌（李），牡丹芍藥海棠紅（陳）。觀花不飲心如醉（白），醉倒花前月朦朧（趙）。一片芳心作蝴蝶（李），飛來飛去入花叢（陳）。美人蔥素紫羅綺（白），語笑花間喜氣蔥（趙）。貽我佩環傳心愫（李），復將心事托絲桐（陳）。柔情已為奇音動（白），忙忙飛舞採花蜂（趙）。與君竊藥先奔月（李），森然火會廣寒宮（陳）。廣寒月色皎（白），報我三青為（趙）。玉華露液濃（李），相思夢來繞（陳）。錦花瓊　飾綺羅（白），趙姬慷慨揚清歌（趙）。投桃報李心深念（李），雷陳契合樂如何（陳）。今夕何夕此良晤（白），嬌來錦袖舞婆娑（趙）。球琳瓊玖敵詩句（李），奇詞清韻長吟哦（陳）。長吟哦，得句多（白），九天牛與女，此日共銀河（趙）。魚比目，戲新荷（李），山盟長翠長巍峨（陳）。吁嗟五色雲霞靄（白），豔妍好結同心帶（錦）。同心長繫碧天雲（李），勿使碧雲遊天外（陳）。雲油油，不自由（白），神魂飛蕩與雲流（趙）。中天明月長為伴（李），願伴千秋與萬秋（陳）。我本修然一鳳侶（白），今朝相伴三鸞儔（趙）。願作在天雙比翼（李），鳳雛對舞含嬌羞（陳）。奇瑛勿為年華少，五百天緣猶未了（白）。夭桃今已吐春情，片片輕紅入芳沼（趙）。柳腰嬌弱不禁風，風怒狂搖猶悄悄（李）。桃李不似錦瓊英，抱露春融情窈窕（陳）。愛花都作連枝香，和雨和雲到天曉。從今不作舊夢思，同心齊唱佼人僚（白）。
　　次夕，遂為同牀之會，推錦為先。錦嬌縮含羞。生曰：「姊妹既同歡同悅，必須盡情盡意。」瓊曰：「四姊何無花月興？」奇曰：「四姊何不逞風流？」於是生與錦共歡，錦亦無所顧忌。次及瓊姐，含羞無言。錦曰：「吾妹真花月，何乃獨無言？」奇曰：「彼得意自忘言也。」瓊曰：「如妹痛切，不得不言耳。」以次及奇，再三推阻，錦瓊共按玉肌，生大展佳興，輕快溫存，護持痛惜。瓊曰：「夫哥用精細工夫。」生曰：「吾亦因材而篤。」自是而情已溢矣。至五更睡覺，斜月照窗，生疑為天曙，喚諸姬俱起，則明月在天。錦笑曰：「月出皎兮，佼人僚兮。」瓊笑曰：「星月皎潔，明河在天。」奇笑曰：「月白風清，如此良夜何！」瓊因請曰：「君之歌賦，已得聞矣，妙曲芳詞，未之聞也。願請教。」生曰：「請命題。」瓊曰：「試調《蝶戀花》何如？」生曰：「請刻韻。」瓊因誦東坡「花褪殘紅青杏小」之章，因曰：「君即此為韻，試看可與東坡頡頏否。」生吟曰：誰家寶鏡一輪小，拋向雲間，光遍羅幃繞；夜淺夜深今多少，玉露玲瓏濺芳草。院宇深沉誰知道，驚夢殘更，卻被佳人笑；恨斷楚天情悄悄，花暗蝶朦添煩惱。
　　瓊曰：「甚妙！吾姊妹聯句以和之，何如？」錦辭謝曰：「非所長也。」奇曰：「縱使不工，亦紀佳會。何妨，何妨。」於是瓊為首倡：
　　綠窗人靜月明小（瓊），銀漢波澄，半向藍橋繞（奇）。楚峽
　　春非少（錦），淡淡巫雲擒瑤草（瓊）。不謂　娥來知道（奇），驚起東君，自驚還自笑（錦）。聞睡鴨啼　聲消，幾番惹得多煩惱。（瓊）。
　　生歎曰：「真三妙也。此生何幸，有此奇逢乎！」因復就枕，談話衷情，不能盡述也。
　　自是，屢為同牀之會，極樂無虞。不意笑語聲喧，屬垣耳近。有鄰姬者，隸卒之婦也，疑生為內屬，安有女音，遂鑽穴窺之，俱得其情狀矣。有夕，唯瓊、奇在列，錦以小恙不與。次早，生過其門，鄰婦呼曰：「白大叔昨宵可謂極樂矣。」生詰其由，句句皆真。生不得已，奉金簪一根，求以緘口。婦笑曰：「何用惠也，但著片心耳。」生因歸告錦娘，且曰：「姑勿與二妹知之，恐其羞赧難容也。」錦曰：「此婦不時來此，況有灑灑風情，兼有『只著片心』之言，不為無意於君。君若愛身，不與一遇，機必露矣，君其圖之。」生不得已，至晚，逕詣鄰婦之家，與作通宵之會。果爾得其真情，與生重誓緘口矣。
　　是夕，瓊、奇嗔生不至，候至三更；錦不以告，但口占四句示之曰：
　　「誰知復誰知，花妖窗外窺。花陰月影動，猶自想花枝。
　　瓊、奇驟驚：「異哉此言！幸詳告我。」錦曰：「昨宵事露矣。白郎去矣，尚望同牀會乎！」於是為道其詳，瓊、奇淚漣。自是同牀會散，生、姬深加斂跡矣。
　　慶節上壽會飲　
　　越五月五日，生為趙母賀節。母亦置酒邀生，生辭。李老夫人、陳夫人各遣侍婢催之，生入謝曰：「承諸大母厚意，但恐冒突尊嚴。」老夫人曰：「彼此旅寓，何妨，何妨。」命三姬相見。瓊、奇不出，生飲數杯，逡巡告退。老夫人曰：「守禮之士也。」趙母曰：「此兒無苟言，無苟動，真讀書家法也。其親宦游，無人照管，況當佳節，令其岑寂，吾心甚不安耳。」於是復備一席，令小哥送至生寓共飲。生制一詞，名曰《浣溪沙》：　晴天明水漲蘭橋，畫欄簫鼓明江臯；翩翩彩袖擁東郊，倚闌干悶縈懷抱。武陵溪畔燕歸巢，誰憐月影上花稍。
　　小哥默記其詞，歸為夫人誦之。老夫人精於詞章，瓊之文史，皆老夫人手教者也，極口稱善，以示三姬。三姬聞之悄然。老夫人曰：「汝等不足白郎詩乎？未免謂其傷春太露耳。」三姬微笑。少頃，亦各散去。
　　是夕，生扣重壁小門，瓊、奇固蔽不開。生扣既久，錦娘啟扉。二姬見生，淚下如雨，固問不應，相對惶惶。生知錦泄前言，再三開諭，坐至三更，二姬乃曰：「兄當厚自愛身，吾等罪當萬死。即不能持之於始，復不能謹之於終，致使形跡宣揚，醜聲外著，良可痛也。」因相與泣下。生曰：「月前之誓，三以死生，況患難乎！卿不記申、嬌之事乎？萬一不遂所懷，則嬌為申死，申為嬌亡，夫復何恨！」生即剪髮為誓，曰：「若不與諸妹相從，願死不娶。」三姬亦斷髮為誓，曰：「若不得與白郎相從，願死不嫁。」生曰：「吾之不娶，佯狂入山，事即休矣；卿之不嫁，奈何？」瓊、奇曰：「吾二人幸未有所屬，當以此事明之吾母。哥或見憐，幸也；不爾，則自剄以謝君耳。寧以身見閻王，決不以身事二姓。」生謂錦曰：「於卿何如？」錦誓曰：「生死不相離，離則為鬼幽。於君何如？」生誓曰：「終始不相棄，棄則受雷轟。」於是四人相對盡歡，不復顧忌。
　　越十有三日，趙母誕辰也，生以厚儀上壽，且為三母開筵，復請三姬，同預燕席。李老夫人許之。時二姬亦上壽鞋、壽帕，且稱觴焉。生筵適至，二姬趨避。李老夫人曰：「相見無妨，趙姨之子，即汝表兄也。」－－蓋瓊、奇之母皆產於林，與趙母為叔伯姊妹，故老夫人有是言耳。－－二姬遂出相見，固遜不肯登筵。趙母曰：「幻女畏生客，我與之區處。」於是置生席於堂之小廂，命小哥侍焉。飲至半酣，生與小哥出席勸酒。老夫人曰：「酒不須勸，久聞高才，欲請一詞為壽，何如？」生辭謝。老夫人曰：「吾已見《浣溪沙》矣。」生曰：「惶愧！」遂請命題。老夫人曰：「莫如《千秋歲》。」生復請刻韻。老夫人曰：「吾幼時尚記辛幼安有『塞垣秋草，又報平安好』之句，即賡此韻，尤見奇才。」生不假想，即揮毫曰：
　　綠陰芳草，黃鸝聲聲好。瑤台上，華筵表。的的青鸞舞，王母霏顏笑。蟠桃也，千歲　華渾不老。
　　有玉山摧倒，南極先來到。玄鶴算，良非小。優游乾坤裡，添籌還未了。備五福，彭　讓壽考。」　
　　李老夫人曰：「真好詞也。」喚瓊姐曰：「汝向時言能為之，今尚能制乎？」瓊姐遜謝。夫人曰：「聊試一詞，以求教耳。」瓊因制詞曰：
　　玉階瑤草，報道年年好。綺閣上，瓊台表。蟠桃生滿樹，採擷真堪笑。再結子，又是三千年不老。----金樽頻傾倒，王母乘鸞到。壽星高，乾坤小。人在華筵表，勸酬猶未了。齊嵩祝，萬年稱壽考。
　　呈上老夫人。夫人曰：「雷門布鼓，音響頓殊。」生曰：「奇才，奇才！雲所遠讓。」陳夫人目奇姐，曰：「汝鎮日與大姊談詩，我不知云何。今聊試汝，汝其勿辭。」奇出席拜老夫人與趙母，曰：「獻笑，獻笑。」復拜生，曰：「求教，求教。」老夫人曰：「不必論詩，禮度自過人矣。」奇制詞曰：
　　瑤池綠草，近來長更好。朱明日，暄人表。況此薰風候，登筵人喧笑。華筵開，共祝那人長不老。----好懷盡傾倒，壽星都來到。乘鸞客，才非少。倚馬雄才，萬言猶未了。吐芳詞，長祝慈闈多壽考。
　　李老夫人曰：「妙哉詞也！可謂女學士矣。」詞畢，各就位。錦娘曰：「請謝教。」於是既奉三母之觴，復過生席勸飲。時蘭香自外持茉莉花來，既獻三母、錦娘矣，一與瓊，瓊曰：「送與小哥。」一與奇，奇曰：「送與白官人。」蘭香遞與生，笑謂生曰：「此花心動也。」錦厭其言，瞋目視之。生亦不快，奇殊不知也。少頃罷筵。
　　是晚，生入三姬繡房，為綢繆之會。與奇會畢，因謂曰：「爾殊不檢點，詞中稱揚太過。」奇曰：「偶筆氛所至耳。」又備述蘭香之言，奇遂大恚。
　　次晨，言之於母。母怒笞蘭香，香曰：「此言誠有，但戲與白郎言之，姐姐安得聞？必是白郎密以告姐，願夫人察之。」夫人生疑，喚奇姐，謂曰：「止謗莫如自修。」奇且復大恚。夫人與詰其得聞之由，奇姐語塞。錦適至，曰：「此言錦實得聞，故以告妹。」蘭香自是言亦塞，陳夫人自此亦生疑矣。
　　涼亭水閣風流　
　　數日後，陳夫人語趙母曰：「天氣炎蒸，人咸染病。百花園涼亭水閣，可居三女於中，錮其出入，何如？」趙母然之。遂自瓊、奇房後開門，恣其園亭逸樂；以為外之房門謹嚴，而不知內之重壁為便。雖諸侍女頗有猜疑，亦竟不知生出入之路。
　　一日，陳夫人詰春英曰：「汝久侍深閨，寧知白郎事乎？」春英曰：「無之。內外並不相見，又無侍婢交通，郎君何由得入？此一也。春初白郎常至，妾猶有疑，今無事輒數十日一來，此二也。且自三月寇警後，西帶諸門俱嚴關鎖，雖侍婢不得往來，白郎能飛度耶？」夫人之疑消。
　　生、姬每日於納涼亭中歡謔，間亦多褻狎，獨瓊姐堅執不從。是月望日，生與錦、奇在臨水閣中作樂，瓊姐不至，錦作書，令奇姐招之。瓊復書曰：
　　劣表妹李瓊瓊斂衽啟覆四表姊妝次：　
　　即晨夏景朱明，鶯花流麗，蓮白似六郎之一笑，榴紅擬飛燕之初妝。魚作態而戲金鉤，鳥沽嬌而穿細霧。納涼亭上，習習清風；臨水閣中，騰騰夾氣，誠佳景也。況有文君之色，太真之顏，凴欄笑語；潘安之貌，相如之才，撫景寫懷，豈不樂哉！然古人有言：『欲不可縱，縱欲成災；樂不可極，樂極至哀』。且蝶慢豈端莊之度，淫褻真醜陋之形。讀《相鼠》之賦，能不大為寒必哉！姊，女中英也；郎，士中杰也，願相與念之。
　　奇姐持書來，曰：「鶯鶯不肯至，紅娘做不成，此書中好一片雲情雨意，要汝等跪聽宣讀。」生長揖曰：「好姐姐！借我一觀。」奇姐曰：「要大姊深深展拜。」錦拜曰：「好姐姐！借我一觀。」奇姐曰：「要大姊深深展拜。」錦拜曰：「好姐姐！借我一觀。」奇姐出諸袖中。生、錦展讀，笑曰：「這雲情雨意，豈不害了相思。不會作紅娘，反會來賣乖。」錦曰：「好好拜一拜還我。」生曰：「我要她替鶯鶯。」摟謔多時，大笑而罷。越十有七日，生聞其叔自荊州回，候接於都門之外。三姬亦以生是日不至，同在納涼亭上女工。飯後，趙母具茶果，遣侍女春英等俱往省之，且密祝以瞰二姬所為。奇姐聞蘭香呼門聲甚急，笑曰：「此婢又來探消息矣。今日若無狀，決加之重刑。」二姬笑曰：「汝今日不懼他矣。」及啟扉，諸婢皆在，雲趙母送茶，三姬談笑啜茗。蘭香步花陰，過柳逕，穿曲堤，無處不至。奇姐索皮鞭以待，曰：「以鞭馬之鞭，鞭此婢也。」蘭香行至芳沼之旁，扣掌笑曰：「好笑，好笑！有一蒂開兩朵蓮花。」奇姐令桂香喚之，至則令跪於地。奇姐曰：「汝自少事我，我有何虧汝？汝乃以無形之事，生不情之謗，汝欲離間吾母子耶？汝到亭中，眾皆侍立，汝乃馳逐東西，欲尋我顯跡耶？汝今尋著否？汝好好受責！」蘭香叩首，曰：「姐姐是天上嫦娥，蘭香是　娥身邊一兔。兔恐　娥薄蝕，無所依傍，乃愛護姐姐獨至，故有前日之言。至如今日，因久不至亭中，偷閒遍閱佳景，豈是有心伺察？如有此心，罪當萬死。且姐姐女流豪傑，白郎文士英豪，豈是相配不過？但恐輕易失身，白姐姐如牆花，姐姐望白郎在雲外，那時悔不及耳。蘭香與姐姐俱，亦與姐姐共患難，安得不過計而曲防？」奇曰：「無端造謗，何如？」蘭香曰：「固知罪矣。然亦姐姐不自檢制耳。詩詞屬意，可疑流目送情，可疑二也；分花相贈，可疑三也。眾人皆有此疑蘭不告？若李瓊姐之端莊，趙四娘之嚴謹，安有此謗？」奇姐大之流血。時瓊、錦游芳沼之濱回，告奇姐曰：「沼中蓮花果開並佳祥也。姑恕蘭香，同去一看。」奇遂釋之。
　　稗歸，俱以並蒂蓮告於趙母。母喜，邀李老夫人諧夫人同賞。酒既具，老夫人持杯祝曰：「老身一子，久官他方，致令女孫及笄，此老身之深慮也。今天賜佳祥，願覓快婿。」又為陳大人祝曰：「奇姐早定良緣。」又為趙母祝曰：「願白生早得佳婦。」時方登席，趙曰：「有此佳祥，可召白生來看。老夫人與陳夫人有不欲意，以趙愛，勉強從之，令秋英、小珠往召。歸報曰：「白大叔有客在，不知發怒。」趙母曰：「春英頗曉事，可往探之。」復歸，報曰：「白大叔原邊白小姐，今曾老爺遠宦邊疆，白老爺不欲大叔遠去成親，曾老欲小姐往歸還親，各有悔意。今年三月內，白老爺運糧入京，與爺相遇，二人言兢，有書退悔。今白老爺遣大叔回家，為大叔再聯姻，因此發怒。」趙母曰：「大叔知我請他否？」春英曰：「他陪叔爺吃飯，即來。」　
　　少頃，生至，且細白之三母。李老夫人笑曰：「有如此才郎，何慮無妻。」趙母笑曰：「兒勿慮，我與汝為媒。芳沼中有蓮並蒂，此是祥瑞，第往觀之。」生因與小哥同往，果見並蒂。生喜特甚。因慷慨飲酒，賦詩曰：
　　中夏正炎蒸，百花何明媚。
　　可笑老天公，凌波浮天瑞。
　　並蒂蓮花開，香風暗度來；
　　瑤池游王母，綺閣泛金　。
　　向人嬌欲語，酷似西施女；
　　相對吳王宮，乘風相嬌倨。
　　日分雙影流，風動兩枝浮；
　　羞向孤鸞鏡，應知學並頭。
　　莫作等閒賞，交枝芳沼上，　
　　瑞靄為誰開，霞標著天榜。
　　香韻遠並清，雙鶯柳外鳴；
　　應與兩岐麥，同薦上玉京。
　　呈之李老夫人。夫人歎曰：「流麗清新，海內才華也。」趙夫人笑曰：「可當聘禮否？」老夫人笑目錦娘，曰：「汝三姊妹聯句和之何如？」二是推讓，錦笑曰：「但作不妨。白兄事同一家，萬勿為異。」二姬然之。點首曰：
　　逢此仲夏景，花香柳自媚（瓊）；兩沼已含流，雙蓮何並難（奇）。風吹昨夜開，渾疑天上來（錦）；為汝登池閣，因茲泛櫻　（瓊）。潘妃渾不語，攜手湘江女（奇）；吳壁喜相逢，二喬斜並裾（錦）。明沙水面流，盈盈合蒂浮（瓊）；翡翠雙飛翼，鴛鴦棲並頭（奇）。王母瑤池賞，雲車停水上（錦）；瑞宇已流春，天門初放揚（瓊）。應識芙蕖清，哪占丹鳳鳴（奇）；太常如可紀，圖此上神京（錦）。
　　老夫人見之，笑曰：「皆女瑛也。」轉呈與生，生驚歎曰：「諸妹才華，近世莫比。」生飲三酌，辭歸。母亦自是罷筵。
　　是夕，趙母謂李老夫人曰：「鄙意欲以白郎配瓊姐，何如？陳夫人亦極口贊成之。老夫人曰：「吾意恐有事未真，議未定，且未識此生意向何如。」趙母曰：「然。姑勿言，待其媒議之時，方可與言及此。」李老夫人曰：「此事成，亦天也；不成，亦天也。」春英聞此語，以告錦娘。錦娘密以告生，且曰：「兄可多遣媒博採，令老夫人聞知，彼乃無疑，自當見許。」生深然之。陳夫人亦有以奇姐配生意，但以相距六歲，心內遲疑。蘭香乘間曰：「婢昨送茶，被姐鞭撻，雖至血流，亦無怨心。但蘭香細看姐姐，卻似有心白郎，莫若早以配之，則一雙兩好，天然無比。」夫人曰：「豈有是事？汝勿多言！」　
　　玉碗卜締姻緣　
　　生數日以叔在，不敢輕入瓊室。叔亦遣媒人求親。
　　是夕，生入錦房，與三姬商議，因曰：「瓊妹奇妹皆吾所欲，但勢難兼得，為之奈何！」錦曰：「吾觀二妹所議，畢竟皆歸於君，但不知誰先進耳。以鄙見論之，此事畢竟皆天也，非人所能為也。」瓊讓之奇，奇讓之瓊，各出誓言，懇懇切切。錦曰：「勿推讓，吾為汝分之。今宵焚香，疏告於天。各書其名，盛以玉碗，先得者今日議婚，後得者異日設策，非一舉而有雙鳳之名乎？」生每日為此縈懷，聞錦言而深是之。遂具告天之疏，一掣得瓊姐之名。奇笑曰：「使吾姊為良臣。吾為忠臣，不亦美乎！」於是四人計定。
　　翌日，生言於叔，遣鄰婦為媒，言於趙母。趙母以告老李夫人。夫人許之，擇日報聘。趙母為具白金四十兩，金花表裡各二對，皆趙母所出也。鄰婦執伐持書於李老夫人，其詞曰：
　　辰下雙沼花開，九天瑞應。某竊計之：老夫人其千年之碧藕乎？仙闕流芳矣；令子老先生其千葉之綠荷乎？海內流陰矣；令孫女其霞標之菡萏乎？繡閣新香矣。茲者雙花合蒂，瑞出一池，豈猶子景雲果有三生之夢，乃應此合璧之奇耶？家兄遠宦，命某主盟。趙母執柯，兼隆金幣。絲蘿永結，貺實倍於百朋，瓜葛初浮，瑞長流於萬葉。
　　李夫人捧讀，不勝欣慰，遂援筆復柬曰：
　　即辰玉池獻瑞，開並蒂之蓮花，老身舉灑祝天，願女孫得快婿。豈是瑞不遠於三時，慶遂成於一日！寅惟執事，名門豪傑；令兄天表鳳凰，而令姪又非池中物也。何幸如之！然蓮有三善焉：出於泥而不濁，其君子之清修乎！擢雲錦與雲標，其君子之德容乎！香雖遠而益清，其君子之徽譽乎！願令姪則而像之，老身有餘榮矣。睹蠟炬之生花，知百年之占鳳；聞鵲媒之報吉，兆萬葉之長春。
　　生得書，喜甚。鄰婦乘間戲生曰：「小姐見書，喜動顏色，官人穩睡，不怕潛窺矣。」　
　　生累日延客置酒，瓊密經畫，整整有條。老夫人稍寬其私，但付之不聞。奇姐雖自斂戢，與生情好益篤，陰自刺其雙臂：左有「生為白郎妻」之句，右有「死為白家鬼」之句。生是夕見之，痛惜不已，雙淚交流，苦無聊賴，自投於牀。瓊因勸奇與之共寢，生終夜傾淚如雨。自是，與奇為益密矣。
　　暇間談論，奇謂瓊曰：「吾未知逮事白兄與否，然感此繾綣之情，雖糜骨何恨！」瓊曰：「除是我死，姊妹便休。若得事白郎，必不致妹失所。」錦隔壁呼曰：「可令我失所乎？」瓊笑曰：「三人同功一體，安有彼此之殊。」錦復笑曰：「吾妹念我否？」瓊曰：「成我之恩，與生我者並，豈不念功！」三人復大笑。自此，生、奇加意綢繆，又將越月。錦、瓊亦體生意，恣其慇懃。時諸婢無不聞知，但皆不敢啟口，惟蘭香自恃美貌，每在生前沽嬌，生屢訶之，因此懷恚，欲泄其機。至是為奇姐所惡，亦不敢言。錦、瓊善自斂藏，內外不甚覺露。
　　自是南陸轉西，九秋勝會，桂有華而擎宮月，　娥親下廣寒；槐奏黃而舞天風，英俊忙馳夾道。生整治行裝，入秋闈應試，與姬相別，無限傷情。三姬共制秋衣一襲，履襪一雙；綠玉之佩，黃金之簪，諸所應用，無不備具。瓊姐制詩曰：
　　良人將離別，淚灑眼中血；
　　杜宇慘悲鳴，秋蟬淒哽咽。
　　此情只自知，向汝渾難說；
　　願步入蟾宮，桂花手中掇。
　　奇姐制詩曰：
　　欲別猶未別，淚珠先流血；
　　訴短及道長，既哽又復咽。
　　不向夫君言，更對誰人說；
　　唯願折桂枝，高高雙手掇。
　　錦亦制詩曰：
　　人別心未別，漫將苦流血；
　　我因夫君淒，郎為妾身咽。
　　行矣且勿行，說了又還說；
　　折桂須早歸，牆花莫去掇。
　　老夫人、趙母、陳夫人各厚贈，諸親友皆贈之。
　　白往至省，溫習經書，屆期入試。然慕念三姬，未嘗少置。而姬亦於晨夕之下，對景無不傷情，乃至多寐之思，亦多敘憂離之思。生以三試既畢，遣僕抵家問安，既奉諸母珍奇，亦饋三姬花勝，致書懇切，不能盡述也。錦、瓊見喜慰，奇姐轉加慘淒，報書曰：
　　　妾陳奇姐斂衽復書於夫君白潢源解元文几：夏光已雲邁矣，秋宇何淒涼也。每中夜涼風四起，孤雁悲鳴，則伏枕淚零，幾至斷絕。聽砧杵之音，如焉如搗；聆簷鐸之響，如有隱憂。此時此情，何可殫述。緬想灑樂之人，寧識憂愁之狀否耶？自昔烏山邂逅，繼以月下深盟。妾謂事無始終，將送微命；君謂此頭可斷，鄙志不渝。懇懇殷殷，將意君即妾也，妾即君也。水宿與俱，雲飛與俱，偶隔一日，則想切三秋。今言別三十日矣，其殆九十秋歟！情胡不切，淚胡不零？天乎！吾何不為涼風，時時與君相傍；天乎！吾何不為飛鳥，日日向君悲鳴耶！妾與君誓矣，與君言矣，諒君亦見信矣，第恐時時乖違，機事傍午。將欲明之於母，又恐母不見憐；將欲訴之於人，又恐旁人嗤笑。訊天，天不聞也；問花，花無語也。其所以自圖惟自樹立者，惟有身死可以塞責。然死如有知，乘風委露與君相周旋，目乃瞑矣；死如無知，與草木同朽腐焉，則又不如久在人世，萬一可以見君之為愈也。然此身實君之身，身不在君，則有死無二。如或惜死貪生，輕身喪節，則又不若朽草腐木之安然無累也。君其為我圖之，存沒之誠，此言盡矣。臨書流淚，不能復陳。承惠玉粉胭脂、翠羽花勝，雖為睹物思人之助，實增誰適為容之悲。附以海物，願君加餐，兼以涼鞋，願利攸往。餘惟棘闈魁選，海宇揚名，是妾等三人之至願也。
　　生僕至，授生書。生方與諸友燕集，展視未完，不能自禁，涕淚嗚咽。友見其書，無不嗟歎，因曰：「有此懇切，無愧潢源之重傷情也。」力叩所由，生不以告。自是功名之心頓釋，故人之念益殷矣。
　　月終揭曉，生雖名落孫山之外，全不介懷。遂策馬為抵家之行，與姬復會。然生之別時，祝奇姐曰：「吾若得意而歸，明與尊堂關說，懇求姻眷，必遂所懷。」以此牽情，心恒悒怏。然三姬見生之歸，如膠附漆。諸母因生之至，便喜動顏容。是夕，過重壁小門，仍為同牀之會。
　　生中夜長歎。錦撫之曰：「功名有分，何必介懷。」瓊曰：「郎非為此縈懷，只為吾妹切念。」生曰：「子真知我心者，為之奈何？」瓊曰：「吾與大姊有妙計矣。」生曰：「願聞。」瓊曰：「君將來必有荊州之行，且先具婚書一紙，表裡一端，白金四錠，付與吾妹。俟君行後，陳姨必將議婚，吾二人決以實告，並以吾妹臂上刺文示之，然後上金幣、婚書，則陳姨勢不得已，事端可諧矣。」奇笑曰：「計則奇矣，但顏之厚矣。」錦笑曰：「如此可成，面皮可剝也。」生曰：「向實為奇姐縈懷，今聞計心釋然矣。」自是，留戀月餘，歡好尤篤。
　　生父命僕來探秋闈之信，且命早至荊州。生不得已，起行。陳夫人謂生曰：「此行未知得再見否？」因相對嗚咽，兩不能勝。生揮淚曰：「姨娘幸勿出此不利之語，雲願姨娘天長地久，既有骨肉之恩，必頂丘山之戴。」陳夫人復流涕曰：「我身寡子單，仗提攜。」生曰：「敢不從命。」夫人流涕而入。
　　三姬相送悽慘，詩詞悲怨。諸母臨別慇懃，致贈甚厚。及其策馬在途，舉目有山河之異，飛舟迅速，臨流切風月之懷。發諸聲歌之詞，皆戀故人之語，則生之思姬何如，姬之思生亦如是矣。
　　錦娘割股救親　
　　時維臘月，寒氣逼人，趙母體羸，忽膺重病。三姬無措，請禱於天，各願減壽，以益母年，未見效也。錦夜半開門，當天割股。瓊、奇見其久而不返，密往視之，乃知其由。嗣是和羹以進，母病遂愈。甲人聞知，上其事於郡縣，郡縣旌曰：「孝女之門。」有詩曰：
　　烏山遙對華山西，花外風清烏自啼；
　　已見文華推多士，哪知節孝屬深閨。
　　剖心從古忠名舊，割股於今徽譽奇；
　　旌別聖恩行處有，誰踵芳躅映文奎？　　
　　趙母置酒，諸眷畢賀。有楊把總者，聞錦娘之美，亦備禮稱慶，以白金二十兩為趙母壽，欲求見錦娘。錦既卻其金，又不之見。楊欲以勢挾之，先令鄰人揚言，且啖以兼金厚利。錦娘曰：「汝為我語刁軍，我頭可斷，我身不可見也。」楊懼而止。是時三姬皆以志節更相矜奮，自生別後，不施脂粉，不出閨門，雖瑞月千門佳麗，三姬處之淡如，元宵樂地繁華，三姬不出遊玩。其操守如此。
　　生自抵荊州與，既見父母，益念三姬，乃請於父曰：「李老夫人，外大母也，慇懃主婚，盍遣人致謝焉。並候動履，且訂婚期。」父許之。生備金幣，遣僕歸訪三母，且致書三姬。其書曰：
　　同心人白景雲奉書於三美人妝次：　
　　雲此生何幸哉！昔時尊貴王公得一女焉，猶可以流聲千古，況雲兼有其三哉！皆天曹神女，仙籍美姬，色殊絕矣。文絢春花，詞映秋水，才超卓矣。堅貞如金玉，灑落類風霞，氣概英達矣。而雲方幸綢繆之際，又聞交儆之言，其所以相親、相期、相憐、相念，又日纟因　焉。則神遊於美人之天，雲此生何幸哉！追想曩時倚玉於芳欄，偷香於水閣，罄人間未有之歡，極人生不窮之趣，美矣，至矣。然此猶為竊藥之會，今皆締為月中之人，則月下深盟，其真無負。五百天緣，悠悠未了也。欣切，欣切。萬里片心，但欲三妹勤事諸母。奇妹姻信未聞，日夕懸注，想志確情篤，則天下事固可兩言而決也。急聞，急聞。身在荊州，神在桑梓，計此情必見諒矣。無多談俗，儀在別啟中昭人。
　　諸母得書喜甚，款僕於外堂。時有朱姓者，貴宦方伯之家，與奇同鄉，有子年方弱冠。聞奇之美，命媒求姻。陳夫人初未之許，後偶見朱氏子，貌美而慧，遂許焉。擇日欲報聘，奇姐忽稱疾，絕粒者三日。夫人惶懼，泣問所由。瓊以實情告之。夫人曰：「焉有是事？門禁森嚴，白郎能飛度耶？」瓊曰：「姨若不信此言，請看奇妹兩臂。」陳夫人見之，駭曰：「白郎在時何不與我言之？今縱不嫁朱氏，後置此女何地？」瓊曰：「妹與白郎慇懃盟誓，生死相隨，決不相背。」夫人曰：「癡心男子，誓何足信！」瓊遂啟其箱，出白金四十兩、表裡各二對、婚書一紙，曰：「此皆白郎奉以為信者也。」夫人曰：「是固然矣，然天長地久，汝姊妹何以相與？」瓊跪而指天曰：「瓊如有二心，隨即天誅地滅。願我姨娘早賜曲從。」夫人曰：「我將不從，何如？」瓊曰：「妹已與瓊訣矣。若姨不從，則妹命盡在今夕。」夫人墮淚，徐曰：「癡兒，汝罪當死！虧我守此多年，亦無可奈何，只得包羞忍恥耳！此事錦娘知否？」瓊曰：「不知也。」夫人因撫奇身曰：「汝私與白，得非慕白郎才郎乎？朱氏之子，俊雅聰穎，將為一世偉人，以我觀之，殆過於白郎矣。」奇不對，瓊曰：「妹身失於白郎，既有罪矣，更委身於二姓，是蕩子也，何足羨哉。」夫人首肯曰：「固是矣，從今吾不強矣。」但禮幣未受，瓊猶有疑，因告於二母。二母親奉禮幣，勸陳夫人受之，夫人尚有赧容。夫人曰：「天下之事，有經有權，善用權者，可以濟經，不爾，便多事矣。」陳夫人因呼蘭香置酒，以謝二母，且曰：「早信此奴，無今日之禍矣。」三母即席，錦娘奉杯。而奇不出，乃獨坐小榻。
　　奇姻事既定，陳夫人復書於生。錦、奇亦以書達生。遂遣僕歸荊州矣。
　　奇姐臨難死節　
　　是時陳夫人以兵變稍息，歸於本鄉，不幸遘疾洽旬。奇往省之。未數日，寇警復作，遂遣奇入城。嗣是盜益熾，夫人病益篤，欲舁之入城，則亟不可動。奇聞變號泣，步行往省。瓊姐執奇手曰：「寇賊充斥，妹未可行。」奇曰：「我寧死於賊手，豈忍不見母瞑。」因絕裾而行。及抵家，寇稍寧息。奇姐虞母不諱，先為置辦棺衾。比至二更，聞官兵大至，眾喜，以為無虞。至五更，乃知即是賊兵。雞鳴，遂圍渾江，剽掠男婦數百。三賊突入陳夫人之房，見夫人病臥，欲逼之以行，夫人不起，抽刃欲兵之。時奇逃在密處，遽呼曰：「勿動手，我代之。」遂出見賊。賊見其天姿國色，歡喜特甚，遂掠以行，並擄蘭香及家僮數人而去。時陳夫人在牀，猶未瞑目也。
　　賊聞官兵欲至，飯後退屯新升橋，至河沿宦署，將所擄男女盡禁其中。奇姐謂蘭香及家僮曰：「我為母病來，豈知為母死！我若不死，必被賊污，異日何以見白郎乎！」乃咬指血書於壁曰：
　　母病不可起，夫君猶未歸；
　　妾身遭此變，兵刃詎能違！　
　　甘為綱常死，誰雲名節虧；
　　乘風化黃鶴，直向楚江飛。
　　題畢，謂蘭香、家僮曰：「吾母子相從於地下矣，汝輩得歸，可與小姐善事白郎。」復謂蘭曰：「吾當急死，稍遲，欲死不可矣。」乃語間，即取裾中所藏剃刀，以袖蔽面，自刎其頸，遂僵仆，血流滿地。蘭香抱之而哭。賊來，怒殺蘭香。因詢其由，鄉鄰備道。賊曰：「我誤矣，此節孝女也，勿污其屍。」於是舁而置之置後月台之上，以紅綾被覆之，相與環泣。其節孝之感人如此。
　　是夕，有人來報，錦、瓊舉家號慟不已。瓊姐願以百金入賊營贖其屍，眾懼不敢往。次日早，報：「官兵殺退賊矣。」又報：「陳夫人即世。」瓊姐帶秋英、新妹、小妹往收其屍；錦娘帶春英殯斂陳夫人。時瓊號泣登台，未至五步，尚聞奇姐長歎一聲，駭曰：「吾妹尚無恙！」急往撫之，則見其氣已絕，顏色如生，尚帶笑顏。瓊曰：「吾妹甘心死乎！」因令人舁歸，與陳夫人同殮。遍尋蘭香之屍，則為賊棄之水中，無復存矣。瓊姐讀其血題之詩，號泣仆地，絕而復甦。
　　瓊姐抵陳夫人之家，與錦娘備辦棺衾，殮住完備，弔客盈門。二女親為執喪。越三日，各為文弔之。瓊詞曰：
　　嗚呼哀哉！吾妹死矣，吾不忍言也。吾與妹歲距三週，居違五里，七歲已同游，十祀曾同學。吾母與若母，兄弟也；吾父與若父，連襟也。汝年十四，吾年十六，即聞兵變。惟時汝父先逝，吾父宦游，吾祖母與若母虞吾二人居鄉莫便也，乃即趙姨之居居焉。坐則共榻，寢則同牀，食則同甘苦。殆於今三年矣。幸得錦姊朝夕綢繆，兼以諸母慇懃教導，吾二人亦欣欣然至忘形骸。
　　嗣是共遇白郎，以骨肉之親而重之以山河之誓；旋復同締姻雅，以絲蘿之舊而聯之以五百年之緣。將謂生則同室，死則同穴，金石莫移也。詎意笑語方懸天匙箸之間，慘淒即見於須臾之際。際愛母心切，不暇顧身；吾慶妹情真，臨行拽裾。豈知裾絕而吾妹去，妹去而禍變臨。賊刃若母，妹安得不出；吾妹既出，身安得不死！然遘賊之時，則寅也，妹不死於寅者，將為全母之計；過此則卯也，夫妹不死於卯者，必其提防之深；及入營，則辰也，方入營，而吾妹死矣。釋此不死，則妹寧有死時乎？　
　　然聞妹將死之時，慷慨賦詩。吾細繹之，其首曰『母病不可起，夫君猶未歸』，孝節見於詞矣；次曰『妾身遭此變，兵刃詎能違』，慷慨以身殺矣；『甘為綱常死，誰雲名節虧』，捨生而取義矣；末曰『乘風化黃鶴，直向楚江飛』，戀戀不忘夫君矣。是詩也，賊人猶自哀憐，況人乎！人見之，猶自慘切見瓊乎！瓊見之亦無可奈何也，使吾郎君見之，其悲哀痛之又若何邪！吾恐白郎為汝傷生，則吾亦為汝殞命矣。嗚呼痛哉！吾今日所以不死者，誠懼傷君之生，益重妹不瞑之目。古人有死於十五年之前者，固已存孤；有死於十五年之後者，亦以全趙。瓊之心猶是也，妹氏諒我心乎？嗚呼已矣，吾目枯矣，吾言不再矣！　
　　然尚有言焉：白郎若歸，倘能不為兒女姑息之愛而為丈夫萬世之謀，吾即汝平時玩好珍寶，市田若干永為祭奠之需；高大窀穸，永為同穴之計，則相離於今時者，當相合於永世。孰謂九泉之下，非吾聚樂之區邪！嗟夫痛哉！妹之容顏比秋月矣，文采若春花矣，性情類清風矣，氣節傲秋霜矣，孝誠動天地矣，餘何忍言哉，餘何能言矣！　
　　嗚呼！長江淒淒，寒風烈烈；山嶽幽陰，天地昏黑。欲見汝容，除非夢中不可得。汝若至楚見白郎，道我肝腸片片裂！
　　奇娘亦有哀詞，其愁怨悽慘之狀，不下於瓊，但不能悉載也。二母亦會弔。奇有弟雙哥，甫七歲，趙母為之鞠育。喪事畢，二母、二姬俱泣，淒涼之態，何可盡述！　
　　生在荊州，遙望老僕不至，想見三姬甚殷，父母遣生歸畢姻。瓊父母亦遺僕來會姻期。生遂與其叔束裝為歸計矣。
　　白生原配曾邊總之女字徽音者，賦性貞烈，才貌超群，精通經史，頗善歌詞，酷愛《烈女傳》一書，日玩不釋。聞其父與白氏悔親，將再續聘總兵之子，遂獨坐小樓，身衣白練，五日不食。父母見其亟也，詢問其故，因紿之曰：「吾從汝志，豈不復然。」徽音乃漸起飲食。
　　吳之子，名大烈，亦將中豪傑，善用馬上飛劍，擲劍凌空，繞身承迅捷如神，邊庭敬之畏之。邊總欲使徽音見其才能，謀之媒人，於中庭開角會，令家人悉升樓聚觀。大烈坐於金鞍之上，衣文錦繡，容如傅粉，唇若塗朱，擲劍倒凌，飛槍轉接。眾皆羨其才能，又羨其美貌。女徐問於侍婢曰：「此何小將軍也？」柳青答曰：「吳總兵之子也。」女即背坐不觀。
　　次日，父母又遣兄弟道意，女復賦《閨怨》以見志。其詞曰：
　　怨中閨之沉寥兮，羌獨處而蕭蕭。心侘傺而苦難兮，乃懷恨而無聊。悼餘生之不辰兮，與木落而同凋。天窈窈而四黑兮，雲幽幽而漫霄。雷轟轟而折裂，風蕩蕩而飄飄。豈予志之獨愚兮，乃撫景而怊怊。愛伊人之不擇兮，即芳菲為菰藻。木南指而若有所向兮，乃薰桂而申椒。鳥南飛而若有所棲兮，聲嚶嚶而鳴喬。餘胡茲之不若兮，對朔風之漉漉，歎嬌音以哀號兮，悵烏山之相遼。問桑梓之何在兮，更寒修而迢遙。中庭望之有藹兮，湛溘死而自焦。餘非捨此取彼兮，虞綱常而日凋。誰能身事二姓兮，仰前哲之昭昭。餘既稱名於夫婦兮，敢廢轍而改軺。芳芳烈烈非吾願兮，望白雲於詰朝。縱云龍而莫予顧兮，甘對月而魂消。天乎！予之故也，何怨中閨之沉寥云。
　　閨賦既成，遂黏於樓壁，坐臥誦之，五日不食。父母驚訝，乃遣其弟二郎奉敕差往江南勾軍，並送徽音歸家完娶婚。臨行，戒之曰：「我前日退書既至，白郎再配無疑。若願並娶，允之無妨。若不相成，訟之官府。要之，事難遙度萬里之外，汝自裁之。」從行侍女二人：柳青、蓮香也；童卒二人：熊次、丁鸞也。
　　二郎馳驛還鄉，白馬雕鞍，強弓利箭，眾皆以為邊帥，無敢近者。生回家，至中途，偶與相遇，見彼人強馬壯，車騎森麗，遂踵其跡而行。比至郵亭，見一女下車，綽約似仙子，問力士曰：「此是何人？」答曰：「曾邊總老爺小姐，回家完親。」生疑，問叔曰：「徽音回家完親，不知更適何姓？請往省之。」因戒僕曰：「勿露我姓名。」生遂投刺更以姓田。二郎延入相見。生問曰：「鄉大人自何來？」二郎曰：「遼邊。」生又曰：「今何往？」二郎曰：「奉敕回家。」生又曰：「貴幹？」二郎曰：「勾查軍伍。」生曰：「亦帶寶眷耶？」二郎曰：「送舍妹還鄉成親。」生曰：「令妹夫何姓？」二郎曰：「庠生白景云。」生曰：「此兄娶李辰州之女，二月已成親矣。」二郎曰：「兄何以知之？」生曰：「家君與之同宦荊州，故備知其詳耳。」二郎曰：「既知其詳，愚不敢隱。」因述其終始。生笑曰：「以尊翁之貴、令妹之賢，何懼配無公侯，乃關情於白氏之子乎？」二郎又誦其妹《閨賦》之章及夫不適二姓之意。生嘖嘖歎賞，復請二郎再誦，生一一記之。二郎曰：「兄之聰穎，無出其右。」因留飲焉，相對盡歡。及二郎回拜，與叔相見，盡列珍饈暢飲。
　　自此同行，道上綢繆，不啻兄弟。二郎俱以實言，生終不以實告叔見徽音節操，勸生並聚。生曰：「姪非不欲，但既與奇姐深盟，此時必須兩娶，倘一娶得三，獲罪於士夫，見非於公議。雖父母，謂我何！且此女未必真心，二郎未必實語，雲將探其真情，抵家，再為區處。」　
　　次日，令其叔紿於二郎曰：「舍姪實未議親，令妹若肯俯就，甚所願也。」二郎曰：「但恐家妹不從耳。」二郎從容為妹言之，徽音喚柳青曰：「取水來洗耳，吾不聽污言也。」因以生求婚詩進。徽音見之，呼蓮香曰：「取水來洗目，吾不觀污詞也。吾兄再談此語，將送吾命江中。」自是二郎不敢言，生亦不敢謔。然生雖有敬慕徽音之意，而不敢為三人並娶之謀。日夜輾轉，無可奈何。
　　一日，將抵家，與二郎別曰：「吾實與兄言，白郎吾表親，事必與我謀。今白郎已娶瓊姐為妻，更有情人奇姐為次，令妹若去，置之何地？若令妹居長，彼必不甘；若令妹居下，堂堂小姐，豈後他人？以吾計之，唯有三人共結姊妹，可以長處和氣，不知尊意何如？」生言既畢，因誓不欺。二郎乃與徽音共議，復於生曰：「家妹身為綱常，非貪逸欲。若見白郎，可免失身之患，若論長幼，則亦無意分爭。」生曰：「如此則善矣。」翌日，相別。
　　生自荊州至家，與老僕途中相遇，已喜奇姐事諧。至日，入見老夫人、趙母矣。錦姐出見，面慘流淚。生甚怪之，因問奇姐及陳夫人，老夫人紿以在鄉。生見錦娘慘容，力問其故，趙母不得已，言之。生大號慟，昏絕仆地，扶入臥牀，昏睡不醒。老夫人祝錦娘曰：「此生遠歸，傷情特甚，汝為兄妹，便可往省。萬一失措，將奈之何！」是夕，錦率諸婢奉侍左右，生殊不與交言，終夜號泣飲水。
　　次早，往鄉祭奠，錦、瓊懼其傷生也，遣春英、新珠侍之。生見柩即仆地，移時方蘇。如是者四。生之叔見其甚也，代為祭奠，擁生肩輿以歸。
　　生二日不食矣，老夫人彷徨，親手進食。生不視，老夫人恚曰：「汝欲斃老身乎！既知有陳姨，亦知有我；既知有奇姐，亦知有瓊；且彼為子死孝，為女死節，夫復何恨？子豈不知天命，而為無益之忿耶！」趙母亦苦勸，生稍進食。因令人為奇招魂，立主以祀之。奇弟雙哥，托錦為之撫養。奇柩在鄉，倩人為之守護。以白金為奇女祭田，具簿書為奇綜家貲。其招魂詞曰：
　　哀哉魂也！予之招兮，魂何在乎？在大之兮。然魂為我死。豈忍舍我而之天兮？哀哉魂也！予之招兮。魂何在乎？在地下兮。然魂欲與我追隨，烏能甘心於地下兮。哀哉魂也！予之招兮。魂何在乎？在名山兮。然山盟之情人兮，魂得無望之而墮淚兮？哀哉魂也！予之招兮。魂何在乎望滄海兮。然海誓之約未伸，魂得無睹之而流涕兮？哀哉魂也，予之招兮。魂何在乎？在東南兮。然金蓮逕寸，安能遨遊於東南兮？哀哉魂也！予之招兮。魂何在乎？在花前兮。然言寂花容遂減，魂何意於觀花兮？哀哉魂也！予之招兮。魂何在乎？在月下兮。然月圓而人未圓，魂何心於玩月兮？　
　　嗚乎哀哉兮，滂沱涕下。無處旁求兮，茫茫苦夜。予心淒淒兮，莫知所迓。豈忍灰心兮，乘風超化。反而以思兮，既悲且訝。疇昔楚江兮，夢魂親炙。靜坐澄神兮，精爽相射。乃知魂之所居兮，在吾神明之舍。
　　嗚呼哀哉！魂之來兮，與汝徘徊。予之思兮，腸斷九回。生不得見兮，葬則同垓。有如不信兮，皎日鳴雷，興言及此兮，千古餘哀。天實為之兮，謂之何哉。死生定數兮，魂莫傷懷。死為節孝兮，名徹鈞台。愧予涼德兮，獨恁困頹。魂將佑我兮，酌此金　。
　　碧梧雙鳳和鳴　
　　自是，生為錦娘苦勸，漸理家政，稍治姻事矣。然自歸後，未嘗與瓊相見，托錦達情。瓊曰：「言別期久，欲見心切。然郎為妹傷情，我亦為妹切念，悲哀情篤，歡愛意溺，且伊邇婚期，願郎自玉。」錦復於生，生曰：「吾此時憂切，非為風情。但偶有一事，欲見相議耳。」錦問其由，生具以徽音之事告之，且出其所作《閨賦》。錦以事告瓊，瓊曰：「萬里遠來，若不並娶，彼將何之？吾固非妒婦也。」生托錦以事白之趙母及李老夫人，夫人曰：「瓊意何如？」錦曰：「願。」李老夫人曰：「待吾細思之。」錦曰：「彼邊庭遠至，若不得婚，必訟於官，似為不雅。」老夫人曰：「娶之不妨。」錦因對生言，生大歡喜。
　　翌日，二郎遣舊媒來言姻事。生正猶豫之際，忽見來僕自荊州回，以生自起行後，父聞總兵遣女回家就親，懼生為彼所訟，故遣僕致書，命並娶以息爭端。生與叔意遂快。復書，請二郎面議。
　　次日，二郎白馬雕鞍，皂蓋方旗，侍從錦袍，金鎧銀鏃，儀衛之盛，遂造白郎之門。生與叔衣冠迎接。坐定，二郎曰：「請家姊夫相見。」生笑曰：「不才路次輕誑公子，獲罪殊深，願公見諒。」二郎曰：「早知是吾姊夫，途中不加意痛飲耶？」因兩釋形骸，款洽言笑。生大設席，二郎痛飲。婚期之議已成，二郎遣人歸報徽音。生曰：「吾附去書，看還醒目否？」　　
　　洗耳尚未乾，忽聞佳信至。舟中探花郎，天上乘鸞使，何事重慘淒，應須多嬌媚。藍橋會有期，秋波頻轉視。
　　徽音見之，略無動容。蓋平時喜顏不形、德性堅定固然也。
　　二郎至晚回家，為道詳悉。亦治姻具生，涓於五月十一日畢姻。是日也，榴火飛紅，燦爛百花迎曉日；蓮金獻瑞，芬香十里逐和風。滿道上百二祥光，一簾中十分春色。車行馬驟，廣寒宮裡女亙娥來；樂奏聲聞，閶闔殿前仙侶至。星郎游洛浦，濟濟蹌蹌；神女下瑤台，嬌嬌綽綽。更有丫環數輩，皆仙籍之名；僮僕幾人，悉天曹之力士。登筵佳客何殊朱履三千，入幕女賓直賽巫山十二。其物華之盛，儀衛之多，不能盡述也。
　　客有善為援史者，作《碧梧棲雙鳳圖》以獻。生愛之，與徽音、瓊姐聯詩云：
　　金井碧桐梧（生），高崗雙鳳呼。五色浮神采（音），百尺長蒼瑚。藻翮翔清漢（瓊），風翎入翠圖。銀牀萋奕葉，丹穴試雙顱。阿閣朝陽地，楚宮棲鳳都。齊聲調律呂，合味薦醍醐。比翼終天會，沖霄千仞途。瓊枝應向我，徽韻自知吾。綠蔭留萬載，瑞與九苞符。
　　徽音入門之後，侍錦娘、瓊姐無不週悉，奉趙母老夫人則盡恭敬。凡於生前有所咨稟，必托錦、瓊代言，其賢於人遠矣。自是，趙母與生為一家之好，錦娘與生盡始終之情。
　　生後擢巍科，登高第，官次翰苑為名士夫。徽音生二子，瓊姐生一子，皆擢進士，後瓊姐、奇姐、徽音與白生合葬於南洲之南，迄今佳木繁茂，多產芳蘭，子孫履墓，裡許聞香。世人皆以為和氣致祥云。

　　賣妻果報錄　
　　張鑒，乃秀水人也，落魄無羈，不事生業，日惟買笑纏頭，縱情趨櫱，家計為之一空。其妻紡績自給，略無怨意。鑒則反生薄倖，謀諸牙婆，賈妻於江南人，得重價焉。
　　妻負死不往，江南人驅迫下船。載至一處，四面都水鄉，茂林中，崇垣疊屋。扣門，有老嫗出，喜曰：「行貨至矣。」須臾，扌卒鑒妻入一室，木桶旋繞，不異囹圄。其中有婦十餘，或有愁眉而坐者，或有揮涕而立者。鑒妻與俱終日不食，惟號泣以求死。守者怒究其故，鑒妻紿之曰：「妾有金飾一匣，乃亡母所貽者，因夫浪費，不與之知，寄在鄰家，自以不忍捨去也。」守者聞言，告於主人，欲利所有，不逆其詐也。遂復載之回。至，則鑒妻奔走叫冤，鄰眾悉聚。江南人被擒到官。比及拘鑒，先已遁去矣。情竟不白。
　　余適遇鑒妻，道及其事，因作《賣婦歎》一篇，欲獻執政而不果，並載此集，以警世云：
　　「西家有女少且妍，嫁與東鄰惡少年。可憐一旦成反目，寶劍擬絕瑤琴弦。西南有等拘人虎，潛令牙嫗來吾所。百金無吝買佳人，落花已被風為主。悠悠夜抵武林村，獨舍無鄰牢閉門。其中坐臥多女伴，彼此泣下難相存。置身如在囹圄內，鵠寡鸞孤不成對。掠人更待掠人來，此時計財寧計類。晨昏逼逐下江船，江水茫茫恨接天。回首鄉關雲樹隔，未知落在阿誰邊。假令賣作良人婦，以順相從尚不故。若教為妾得專房，負妨招嫌恩不固。又或賣為富家奴，汲水負薪歷苦途。供承少錯即凌虐，有路難歸空怨夫。無端墮落風塵裡，向人強以悲為喜。知心日少惡交多，送舊迎新如免死。人間情愛莫妻孥，忍暫何異具起徒。寄言並致買臣婦，貧賤相守當永圖。」　
　　江南人深恨鑒妻之詐，不吝千金贖之，繫以鐵鈕，恣加捶楚，不勝痛苦。過江時議欲賣與娼家。鑒妻受責頗多，絕粒又久，臥病竟不起矣。一日，忽長吁而逝，黑氣瀰漫，口有巨蛇躍出。居人甚駭，買棺貯而瘞之。
　　時遇醫人經其處，草際見蛇蛻一條，腮下紅白，異而收於囊，將為藥餌之料。是夜，即夢少婦拜於前曰：「妾，秀水人也，被夫賣至此地，不願忍辱偷生，已致珠沉玉碎。但關山迢遞，冤氣趑趄。今公有龍舌之游，妾敢效驥尾之托，萬弗疑拒，為幸！」言訖大慟。醫人遂覺，反覆思之，莫曉夢婦所謂。及至嘉興東柵外，少憩白蓮寺前，藥囊中聞閣閣之聲，極力不能舉。怪而啟之，見蛇蛻化為白蛇，奮迅越湖而去。停望間，隔岸車水人倏然擁佛。急望其處，則蛇將一人噬其咽喉，絞結而難釋。久之，人蛇俱死矣。審知其人即張鑒，昔嘗賣妻於江南，其地即龍舌頭上。始悟夢婦變幻之靈，報復之速。嗚呼！人其可不慎歟？　
　　聯詠錄　
　　秀水通越門外二里，有瀦水一潭，潭面廣百步，而深則不可測也。且西受天目杭山諸源，湍急莫御。是以天氣清朗，有白光三道起自潭中，直沖霄漢，數裡外人及見之。若遇陰霾，則波濤洶惡，往往為舟楫患。五代時，異僧行雲者經其處，指潭歎曰：「西南險害，無是過也！我當為大眾息之。」遂聚土實潭，建殿其上。落成之夕，三光復自土中突起，僧曰：「吾幾誤矣！」即設高案置香案，自誦咒於案下，光遂收散達旦，僧即築土求材，臨流建廟，題曰「龍王之祠」。其三光起處，又造二浮圖以鎮。水勢既平，湖衝又殺，往來者便之感之。於是錢王賜額「保安」，贈行云為「保安禪主」。及宋，改「景德禪寺」，至今仍之。
　　迄元至正中，有曹睿輩宦游過此，登飲其間，用唐人句分韻賦詩。忽一老人長髯深眼，骨肉崢崢，飄然策杖而至，曰：「老夫去此甚邇，聞諸君高懷，不揣駑朽，亦欲效一顰於英達之前，何如？」諸人心雖嫌異，姑緩而止之。睿即首倡云：
　　「清晨出城郭，悠然振塵纓。仰觀天宇宙，倚矚川原平。竹樹自瀟灑，禽鳥相和鳴。龍淵古招提，飛蓋集群英。唱酬出金石，提攜雜瓶罌。丈夫貴曠達，細故奚足嬰？道義山嶽重，軒冕鴻毛輕。素心苟不渝，亦足安吾生。
　　范恂繼詠：
　　凌晨訪古剎，幽氣集柱阿。雕甍旭日炫，維宇晴雲摩。疏鬆奏笙簧，修竹唱鳳珂。禪翁素所隨，名流世來過。俯澗漱寒溜，涉登扣翠蘿。渝茗佐芳醑，談玄間商歌。遂令塵土壤，如濯清波。茲景誠奇逢，追游亦豈多？流光逐波瀾，飛翼拔高柯。賦詩留苔萍，千載期不磨。
　　牛諒繼詠：
　　靈湫悶馴龍，古殿敵金粟。僧歸林下定，雲傍簷端宿。伊餘陪雅集，於此避炎酷。息陰悟道性，息靜外榮辱。坐石飛清觴，堪歡白日速。別去將何如，留詩滿新竹。
　　徐一夔繼詠：
　　野曠天愈豁，川平路如斷。不知何朝寺，突兀古湖岸。潭埋白雲沒，林密翠霏亂。勝地自瀟灑，七月流將半。合併信難得，通塞奚足算！廣文厭官舍，亦此事蕭散。風櫺爵屢行，蘿燈席頻換。但覺清嘯發，寧顧白日旰？吾欲記茲游，掃壁分弱翰。
　　睿因請於老人，老人隨口而應：
　　憶昔壯得志，雲雷任摩挲。指顧感蛟鯨，叱咤驅風波。已矣而今老，悠悠困江河。良會豈曾識，意契即笑歌。夕歌戀松柱，晚風灑蒲荷。流霞雜輕煙，凌亂襲袂羅。佳景洽高誼，何妨醉顏酡，因嗟開山子，空堂負秋蘿。生年幾能百，時光度槐柯。名利釣人餌，青塚豪傑多。
　　笑彼奔走生，自苦同蠶蛾。經營計長久，一朝委湯鍋。世路且險測，杯弈藏干戈。達人尚高隱，烏帽甘清蓑。江花脂粉勝，林鳥宮商和。石枕待春睡，新芻貯銀螺。對此引深樂，天地奈我何！
　　吟畢，眾人駭然敬服，不以野老視焉。因請名問答，老人曰：「予龍姓，諱雲，字子淵，別號江湖遊客。家本山之西，來有年矣。」眾人喜，遂相與極談，飛觴流飲。及酒闌興盡，命徹登舟。老人拱手言曰：「頃側行旌，承不以樗鄙相拒，敢獻一語酬報諸君，何如？眾皆應曰：「願受教。」老人曰：「諸君夜發，以程計兩日後當過錢塘。但遇江風初動，有黑雲自西北行南，慎弗輕躁取悔。斯時也，果驗愚言忠益，不敢枉謝，得求殿宇新之，則吾鄰有光多矣，將不勝於謝乎？」眾人口諾心非，相禮而別。未數步，回顧老人，忽不見矣。眾皆壯年豪邁，不以為意，急行舟去。
　　及兩日後，早至錢塘江上。風斂日融，江面平靜猶地，欲過者爭舟而趁。恂、諒、一夔促裝使發，惟曹睿曰：「諸兄憶景德老人之言乎？吾輩非報急傳烽、捕亡追敵者，縱遲半日，何誤於身？豈必茫茫然效商販為得耶？」三人相笑而止。笑未已，風果自西徐來，又黑雲四五陣從北南向。睿曰：「一驗矣。」三人曰：「試少待。」頃間，黑雲中雷雨大布，狂風四作，滿江浪勢連天，如牛馬奔突之狀。爭過者數百人，一旦盡葬魚腹，惜哉！曹睿因指謂曰：「諸兄以為何如？」三人失色相謝，睿曰：「爛額焦頭，何如徙薪曲突？此無知魏先平陳受賞，君子美其乾本不忘也。今非此老預告，則吾屬亦化波心一漚矣，何能攜手復相語哉！」三人曰：「誠如兄言。」　
　　遂送棹三塔灣下，訪其曾，俱言西鄰無龍姓之宅。曹睿默然良久。曰：「噫！可知矣，詠詩起聯及名號寓意，宛然一龍神也，何疑！其祠居寺石，故曰『西鄰』；所謂『名利釣人餌，世路且險測』諸言，警悟於吾輩甚諄切也。愚昧凡資，自不能釋其意耳。」遂相與潔牲肴拜　於祠下，以伸謝之。又各出白金三十斤為新殿之費，有僧某，辭不敢領，睿等謂曰：「王之指救，再生大德也，雖欲市珠投報，水路難通，在耳教言，何忍忘者，況有身則能孚財，今縱無財，獨不癒於無身乎？爾能敬忠其事，在山門亦孔榮矣，何用辭！」且顧謂二人曰：「一宦勞身，幾爾寄魂水府，倖存弱質，何當復蹈危途？不若聽鳥家山，看花故裡，醉眠風月光中，以副龍神諷囑之意。不然，湯鍋之禍信踵弊春蠶矣，能不畏哉！」三人皆唯唯應。即日同章告養，托病歸田，可謂卓然達矣。今以「龍淵勝境」匾其門，蓋亦承此意歟？　
　　臥雲幽士評：
　　世有契約借貸而反面不肯償，乞暗蚤明而勞身亦戀祿者多也。今睿等雖免於難，使他人處此，反以福幸為自致矣，何能念及景德老人之言乎？況又非追索邀求而舍金如丸彈，非犯嫌被論而棄位如敝屣，卒能不負龍神所望，豈不誠賢達哉？
　　酒櫱迷人傳　
　　元末有姓姜者，名應兆，世業耕教，為人謹且厚，裡人多稱之。然性惡酒，雖氣亦不欲入息。遇鄉社會飲，則蹙容不滿，曰：「食以穀為主，何事糟粕味耶？」日邁，鄰老飲醉，身軟不能支，姜因而扶歸。見袖中塊然，探之，金也。私自忖曰：「田野無知，得此不為盜。況人昏路遠，豈意我為？」遂竊入已，及歸，酒醒，覓金，金已亡矣，鄰老泣於家曰：「吾子以冤事盂於官，三年不為理，吾子再訴之，官怒其梗頑，強以入罪，例准銀為贖。吾老且病，何忍吾子久繫縲紲中？乃典田鬻屋，得金一錠，昨醉遺途中，落他人之手。前以為雖失吾業，猶可以有吾子也，今並而無之，吾死矣。夫苟且所言，願分半為謝。」姜雖聞其哀怨，未言，竟不動意。
　　是夕二更時，一館生讀倦，暫憩几上，聞門外啾唧有聲。諦聽之，有人似欲進者，喝曰：「汝何物，敢行阻我？」又有人似執門者，應曰：「我乃山桃厲鬼，司人門戶，若遇妖魅，必斧而啖之。爾乃何物，抗然冒進，抑未知吾斧耶？」斯人徐謂曰；』汝不識我，無怪其言之倨也。我姓米，字香夫，號冽泉清士。始祖醴酪君，起跡庖羲時，封居醉鄉，不與夷狄氏善，族遂蕃衍，名通與禹、方將大用，奈為奸人所讒，疏斥而不錄。延至夏桀，進秩瑤台士卿，與肉山脯林相左右。及事商，復遭際於桀，膺長夜之寵，以此名重天下。周遂計之，作誥數我，謫我為青州從事，我悔艾，即奮然修改。當春秋戰國間，默然懶事，不求合於人。二世僭興，念人主如六驥馳隙，乃悉耳目，窮心志，索我於荒寥窮散中，晝爾與俱，宵爾與游，脫有不見，則深思而呼召，親幸之專，雖斯、高不能及也。自是我益尊，職益重，朝野群然慕其風味。故漢高仗我斃白帝於澤中，宋祖得予釋兵權於席上。竹林助劉、阮之清聲，禁掖發李賀之才思。子思辭我於饋者，可盡孝以明廉；寇準假我於澶淵，能安居而退虜。既頹阮氏之玉山，復入黨家之錦幕。潛身比舍，敢誇畢卓豪情；息火成都，用顯欒巴妙術。染海棠之號於楊妃，健草聖之豪之和旭。邀歡戚裡，張鎮周之盡法全恩；取令賊營，郭令公之出奇破敵。流芳靡世，統裔延長，自宋訖今，聲名猶在。吾奉天帝命，來游汝家，縱欲持一斧以相拒，亦無奈我何！」人又曰：「果汝所說，世第若高遠矣。然我非博古者，請再明之。」又似人答曰：「汝猶未解乎？我世掌天下趨櫱事，非木怪禽妖之比，是以享幽非我不格，洽人無我不歡，敬我者聖賢致號，愛我者歌曲怡情，行己在清濁間，而處眾則醇知也。爾欲知我，云爾已矣，他何有哉。」似執門者又問曰：「然則汝業何事？」似欲進者又答曰：「吾嘗病軟飽，因厭事，然猶日能與高陽徒偕竹葉、椒葩、霞泉、雪液輩五六人，泛水登山，穿花步月，無不在耳。倦則甜然一枕，事且不能擾也，況本無乎！」似執門者遂歎曰：「汝真樂人矣，不識今何所居？」似欲進者復曰：「居雖不一，但隨寓所安。或市橋啟肆。或湖舍懸簾；或清釀乎田家，或黃封之御院，或衝寒於雪朝茅屋之中，或遣興於雨夕蓬窗之下；或隨僬簷而穿雲，或侶漁舟而釣月；或被儒貂，興至吟齋，或因妓　，換歸舞閣。廣哉居乎，遇使然也，皆非吾所願也。豈若紅杏樹中，黃花籬下，小門流水，燕影鶯聲，使牧子放牛新草，行人繫馬垂楊，對持瓦礫之樽，以諳茅柴之味，心始陶陶然樂矣。何必優妓佐之，鼓舞維之，牌役強之，徒自取勞苦為哉！」問者又曰：「審汝言，爾殆鬼於酒者。今是之來，禍福抑何所主？」欲進者笑曰：「非敢為櫱耗之耳。主人虧行，陰竊人急迫之財，致父子無措，幾死非命，上帝陰行譴罰，念汝家世有德於鄉，不忍即殛，姑使我迷溺而報之也。」問者又曰：「主人性儉飲，縱耗奚益？」欲進者答曰：「第自有處。」人又問曰：「吾聞酒有德，自古尚之，汝反欲為術，櫱於人果何術以逞耶？」欲進者答曰：「居，居，與汝語！當某賓主應酬，禮恭迎肅，鐘磬焉，詩歌焉，衣冠楚楚，言語雍雍，雖進退俯仰間必中節度，此上飲也。我相之。及至杯盤狼藉，笑謔歡呼。攘臂廳中，僭階越坐，始雖少閒乎禮，終必忘長幼、略尊卑，一惟以和樂為快，此中飲也，我主之，又有沽醪市脯，斂分派錢，撰號呼名，笑罵交錯，歸則攜手街途，口似曲而糊模，身欲行而傾側，日習為常、不以家為意者，下飲也，我陰使之。然猶未甚也。至若提壺市上，乞汁土番間，踝跣傴僂，成行逐伙，夜則寄夢橋亭，曉則懸飄寺宇，蟻蝨為鄰而腥羶為襲，若而人者，不可謂非我困苦之也。又有承祖父之厚遺，不思守繼，而乃酷與蓮花君合，日挈無賴之徒，揮金縱飲，雖良朋至戚瞑眩切救而不入，必至房易主主，子妾依人，猶且遑遑然鼻嗅心香，思欲一灶吸以償願，千方求辦，弗得弗止，若而人者，不可謂非我沉昏之也。又有饕暈漿於顯者，仰飲食於相知，迎走趨陪，終宵不厭，及其口腹相忤，量不勝貪，頭重足輕，順入者悖也，濁氣熏人，視溝渠圂廁中以為枕席在是矣，恬然眠臥而莫覺，若而人者，不可謂非我坐刂辱之也。又有被醉使狂，尋嗔生事，不合則拳足相加，或傷人，或殺人，由是羈縻官府，桎梏囹圄，傷者枝條，殺者抵死，罪未成而家先敗，悔救何能及哉！若而人者，又豈非我有以顛倒之邪？」問者良久謂曰：「飲酌皆前定，果有之乎！合我且退，爾且行。」啾唧之聲遂息。館生大駭，及明，亦不敢泄。
　　午炊後，見應兆忽思酒，索於家人。家人曰：「厭糟粕者亦復如是邪？」應兆曰：「姑破俗可也。」然忻然拈壺滿酌，至醉而罷。家人生徒輩俱異之。惟夜讀者默識其意。
　　由是，日夜酣歌，遨遊博飲，心雖知其失而勢不可回，若有神使之者。不半年間而所竊之金悉償酒稅。醉則狂歌罔語，鄉中人漸鄙之，生徒俱散。再三年，世遺資產盡變費以供口腹，衣服垢結，容體羸枯。家人痛哭，謂曰：「追思豐樂人家，一旦伶仃至此！費者不可復完矣，而郎君素循善，何不改易弦轍，為訓後人？不然，使虧玷世德，自郎君之身始，甚可羞也」應兆不對，趨出，匿於村店中，買酒自遣。心懷愧忿，飲亦不成醉，沉吟俯首，至夜忘歸。適店主涉事於外，其女見應兆雅飾，心欲私之，更餘，以言侵狎應兆，遂行自獻。應兆默忖曰：「向因一念之差，病狂流落，今雖修積及時，補且不逮，而況淫污非道以重之，死無所矣！」乃堅持固卻，以為「不可，不可」，竟秉燭待曙而還。
　　是夜寢熟，夢一人施禮牀人，曰：「吾，酒櫱也。前因不義，來醉汝心。四年於茲矣，昨夜一念起善，上帝知汝非怙惡者流，敕吾別游，不相迷擾，從此永辭。君宜亦勉。」覺來行雨如流，口嘔一物墮地，令人起燭之，若血塊然者。
　　及明，遂不思飲。試以酒置於前，厭惡如故。其子復立家成業，應兆亦享壽而終。
　　應兆之妻親陸某者，嘗書此事以垂戒。予因述此，以繼陸某之志云。
　　翠珠傳
　　翠珠姓王，禾城名妓也。丰姿婉潤，聲色絕群，人有慕之者，非重價不輕接。
　　一日，國學生潘某聞其名，盛資而往，因與之狎，情甚綢繆，分釵破鏡，剪髮燃香，誓同死生。交袂年餘，而潘生之囊篋十蕩八九於其門矣。已而赴試秋闈，兩不能捨，臨期泣執一勝。
　　潘因家隨廢落，臨事羈遲，淹於旅者兩載。後得解歸，越日即往候。翠珠方坐中堂，同一富商對飲，見潘至，牾不為容，若不識一面者。及發言，竟以姓問。潘雖疑異，猶意其假托於人前也，明日再往，使家人召之別室，及相見，而情亦然，潘怒，出所剪髮擲之，曰：「子知此物乎！」翠始轉顏回笑，近坐呼茶，而潘終洶洶不平矣，乃拂袖言旋。翠亦無援心。
　　歸家大怒，以其事訴於友，欲石厲刃以磔此恨。其友歎曰：「娼行甚劣，本其故態，兄抑以為異邪？自昧而自蹈之，尤人何益！」潘意稍解，因作《解嫖論》以示人云：
　　夫人常情，非愛財則愛身也，非畏法則畏禮也，非慮前即慮後也，非好名則好勝也。人之於財，或以毫釐而貿易難成，或以分文而童僕笞撻，或以假借而朋友分袂，或以不均而兄弟構詞，至於淫色，則傾囊橐破家資而欣為之，甚則甘餓殍胥盜賊而終身不悟也，謂之何哉？人之於身，或以墜馬而畏騎，或以危舟而畏渡，或刺皮膚而弗色
　　然怒不可當，或有小疾而戚然恐不能起。至於淫色，則耗精神喪元氣而恬然為之，甚則染惡瘡耽惡疾而甘心不悔也，謂之何哉？且無祿者犯奸有罰，職役者宿娼有禁，法之可畏也明矣。今之人，縊死於舊院，刺殺於南樓，為嫁買而經官問罪，緣淫奔而出醜遭刑，可不羞之甚邪！色荒之訓《書》有之，冶容之戒《易》有之，理之當鑒也明矣！今之人正氣喪於邪氣，名節喪於妖媚，居鄉則見惡於閭裡，居官則招議於縉紳，可弗思之甚耶？祖之有孫，願其繩武以顯我門庭，父之有子，願其克肖以分我憂慮，今或為色破家喪命，辱其祖父，而祖父以此怨恨至於病且歿者甚多，是使其身為不孝不慈之身，雖有他能不足稱也，光前之道，固如是乎？妻之有夫，望其為我之托而醮一不移，子之有父，望其為我之天而終身永賴，今或為色捐家廢產，離其妻子，而妻子以此窮困見辱於人者恒多，是生其身為無禮無義之身，雖有豪才不中取也，裕後之道，又如斯乎？死於戰者以勇名，死於諫者以直名，若死於淫色者名之為敗子，為其敗家也，名之為下稍，為其流落也，苟有好名之心者，當有所恥而不為矣。而人固安之，何其愚哉！業學者以文勝，業農者以耕勝，若出於淫色者或生乎男，何忍使之為優也？或生乎女，何忍使之為妓也？苟有好勝之心者，當有所擇而不為矣。而人顧願之，何其卑哉！或者以子美之四娘、安石之雲月、東坡之琴操、陶谷之若蘭為四公之樂，而不知此實四公之累也。或者以相如之竊玉、韓壽之偷香、張敞之畫眉、沈約之瘦腰為四君之豪，而不知此實四君之玷也。故與其為項羽之嬖虞姬，孰若為雲長之斬貂蟬？與其為君瑞之謀崔鶯，孰若為睢陽之殺愛妾？與其為申生之慕嬌紅，孰若為賈清之搬煙花？明此，於窮則為清白之君子；明此，於達則為正直之大夫；明此，於寒微則可以立家；明此，於富足則可以保業，所謂腰家仗劍與色不迷人云者。嘗讀《孔子世家》，見柳下惠坐懷不亂，魯男子閉戶不納；讀《晏嬰實錄》，見裡婦顧嬰微笑，晏子悔責數日之言：讀《江右野史》，見馮商聘妾遣還、生子狀元及第之報，乃喟然歎曰：「不淫女色，非獨愛身也，愛德也，而財又不足言矣；非獨畏理也，畏天也，而法又不足言矣；非獨慮後也，慮鬼神也，而前又不足言矣；非獨好名也，好積善也，而好勝又不足言矣。知此，則楚館秦樓非樂地也，乃人之苦獲也；歌妓舞女非樂人也，破家之鬼魅也；傳情遞笑非樂意也，迷魂之樂意也；倒鳳顛鸞非樂事也，催命之妖狐也。引而伸之，觸類而長之，雖家梅不可折，而況於野乎？雖女色不可淫，而況於人乎？鄙見如斯，人情自悟。」　
　　後因復就秋試，夜泊江邊，忽見富商立舟上，顏枯衣縷，為人執薄設之役。生異而問曰：「尊官可念王翠珠否？」其商駭愕曰：「公非中堂相會者乎？」潘曰：「是也。」商即蹙容曰：「僕因此婦迷戀，揮金與游，然猶未甚，後許攜資嫁我，情好益篤，我始罄所有而與之，意為彼即我矣。豈知牀頭一空，前言若水，香消翠冷，愛轉情飛。其母復妨惡，促我豪糧，逼我行芨，又且嗔兒撻婢，無非欲激逐我也。我不能當，隱忍走出，方欲鳴之官司，而母子已徙他所。無可奈何，以故依棲流落，寄食於人，又不知家園松菊之何如也！」言訖淚下，潘因招飲，以贐資十餘兩之而別。
　　及抵試，得領畿薦。榮回時，翠珠母子已艤舟迎叩矣，潘乃揚帆不顧。因使人摭辱之。
　　不數月，潘之友一夕飲散，經潘之門，見綠衣人驅：女子而立，悲愴不肯進。紅衣人曰：「業已承認，又復何言？」又曰：「翠珠，翠珠，誰令如此！」押之而入，友疑其事，早往訪之，則潘家夜育二犬乃問翠跡，母子以暴病夜卒矣，潘與友拍掌大笑，以為奇異。及呼之「翠珠」，搖尾而應，嗚呼！迷人誘引，所害者不止一儒一商也，乃以此報，豈負珠哉！　
　　買臣記　
　　漢朱買臣者，舊吾郡由拳縣人也，字翁子，與同邑嚴照垂髻相菩，結為刎頸之交，且約曰：「苟相貴，毋相忘。」家雖甚貧，不喜生業事，惟好讀書。夫妻艱於口食，遂採薪以為給。身擔負，口讀書，遇有悅解處，則吟哦諷詠之聲迤邐道上。其妻常恥之，謂買臣曰：「丈夫立身，上不得弧矢以行志，下不能貨殖以營生，筋骨體膚勞餓以倦，方且悲傷之不暇，而乃犯歌若得，竊為君不取也。」買臣曰：「貧者士之常，若非分張求，則悖命矣，君子恥之。負薪行歌，何恥之有？」其妻復勸曰：「吾聞讀書以治生為先，未聞作一詞、撰一賦而可易斗粟於家、尺帛於女者。今君欲仗章句以卻饑寒，計誠拙矣。況醫、卜、農、工皆能立業，何不捨此務彼，徒久誤足文場，困身藝圃，棲棲然效秦坑酸鬼以自苦哉？」買臣又笑謂曰：「富貴雙途，賢者所難致。子以我為池中物耶？一旦雲雷我假，鼓波滄溟，斯予得志之秋矣。何不俟命待時，徒怨奚益！」妻遂大怒曰：「邑中挾策之士連袂同升者十下八九，爾猶奔走，衣食且不逮，是天不欲竟爾業也。若復執迷而不改圖，吾恐力盡計窮，溝壑有日，何得志之可望耶？」買臣乃長歎曰：「鴻鵠非燕雀所知。此蘇秦、百里奚之見辱於其妻也。及其取相六國，輔政兩朝，是卒前日見辱之人為之。二婦既不能料二子矣，子獨能料我乎？」其妻怒且泣曰：「爾自執經以來，誤我以久。及念思悔，猶且難為，而況癡比古人，夢想以邀難必之福，吾知啼號之態終不能免也，仰望豈不癒絕乎！故或受我忠言，偕老可托，不然，則巾櫛不敢復侍矣！汝將何從？」買臣亦怒曰：「丈夫志節豈為婦人所撓？汝身可無，我業決不可輟也。」妻遂再拜曰：「半生即枉，再誤何堪！吾雖渾跡於童婢之中，亦得以溫飽終歲，豈不癒於鑠骨銷形，豈成凍餒之殍乎哉！從此請辭。」忿不為止。將行時，鄰家一犬趨，搖首尾，於後齧其裙，不使之走，似若勸阻之意，婦雖怒為揮喝，牢不肯脫。家中一雞，亦相撲，啄其衣，又似啄其犬者。鄰嫗以為異，婉言援之。妻不納，竟去，遂自嫁於杉青吏人。
　　買臣見妻去，不能為情，復歌以自遣云：
　　「朱買臣，朱買臣，行歌負擔妻子嗔。恩情難繫薄劣婦，一旦捐棄如輕塵。鴛鴦分翼比目破，孤燈舉目無相親。貧富於世果炎熱，結髮尚爾況路人！功名到手未為晚，太公八十遇澤新。細君何必苦反覆，吾豈樵柴終其身？朱買臣，何災難，食比玉粒衣懸鶉。自知一卷勝萬貫，時不遇兮怨恨貧。數年衾枕一宵冷，飄風流梗同逡巡。回嗔何處已作喜，髮雲重整眉新顰。朱買臣，莫笑口頻，隱忍依舊肩橫薪。山光泉韻兩如脫，醉臥危石花為茵。翠蘿青鳥暫賓主，芒鞋踏破岩頭春。有時此斧利得柄，一斬天下之荊榛。歌殘煙卷日已暮，松梢新月釣桂銀。」　
　　歌罷，忽自歎曰：「古人功業成於激發者恒多，我何若爾也！」遂詣長安，上書。
　　時嚴照已貴，見買臣，即謂曰：「吾幸先達，而故人猶寒如舊，負約之罪，鳴鼓難償矣。」乃祝吾丘壽王，同薦買臣於武帝。帝召見，說《春秋》、《楚辭》，甚悅其意，遂拜為中大夫，與司馬相如、枚臯等，俾交相議論。
　　時東粵數反覆不軋，買臣請將兵數千：「浮海而下，可卷席取也。」帝又拜為會稽守。買臣至郡，即治戰具，儲糧草，發兵征之，一擎而破。帝壯其功，征為丞相長史。
　　時舟過杉青閘下，閘吏奔趨惶懼。其妻審知買臣也，即脫簪珥，拜伏舟次，曰：「賤妾某氏也，事尊官有年矣，一念迫於饑寒，遂致分手。然心實未嘗昧也。伏望滄海容流，泰山讓土，追思花燭微情，不以妾為大罪，俾得破鏡復圓，斷弦再續，則妾萬幸，萬幸！」買臣長笑曰：「汝記昔日之言乎？怨恨求離，以我為泥中蛆蚓，詎料貧賤未必常，富貴未必久，絕情斷義，曾雞犬之不若，而今又附勢趨炎，置閘吏於何地？撫今追昔，揚水不能收矣！何乃冒方湃之顏，出重赧之色以求見我哉？羞死宜甘，強辭宜補。」言下，辟易莫敢對，良久，遂自投於河中而死。買臣即以屍首葬於亭灣，名曰：「羞墓」。後人方孝孺題詩於亭云。備如左：
　　芳草池邊一故丘，千年埋骨不埋羞；
　　叮嚀囑咐人間婦，自古糟糠合到頭。
　　宋梅堯臣詩：
　　食藕莫問濁水泥，嫁婿莫問寒家兒；
　　寒兒黧黑而無脂，驥子縱瘦骨格奇；
　　買臣貧賤妻生離，行歌負薪何愧之；
　　高車遠駕建朱旗，銅牙文弩扌不犀皮；
　　官迎吏走馬萬蹄，江湖晝夜橫白霓；
　　舊妻呼載後乘歸，悔淚夜落無聲啼；
　　吳酒雖美吳魚肥，儂今豢養慚雞犬；
　　園中高樹多曲枝，一日桂與桑蟲齊。
　　醒迷錄　
　　正德中，有忠告者，崇德人，祖、父俱顯官，忠得以例授一儒官。為人豁達大度，傲物輕財，性喜博擲為戲，田產雖以萬計，而自視恒約如也。又奉一純陽師甚虔，出必問，入於禮；至於一肴一菜，不先祭則不敢自食。門下有友二人曰故應圭、陸一奇者，日導忠以博飲事。忠雖視為知已，其如二子之口蜜腹劍何！不數年間，家業蕩廢，而二子則日益饒富。
　　一日，會忠晝臥，夢二道士綸巾羽衣，對忠語曰：「子急悔心，不當戀溺。若苦艱之，後園松下之藏，猶可成立。至於胡、陸二子，吾已征示其誅矣。」言華，流汗浹背，覺來見供爐下足一紙飛揚，執以觀之，題曰《醒迷餘論》，墨跡猶鮮。其論附錄於後：
　　「大抵事近於戲則易染，心涉乎利則難逃。是以賭博之事，不計大小久暫，皆足以廢業喪心、招怨動氣，甚者虧名玷節，露恥揚羞，又甚至敗家者有之，亡身者有之。嗟呼！一念少差，竟迷於利，縱有所得，亦不能補其所損，況未必得乎！且以其事言之，滅禮義而尚凶強，去真誠以使機變，當場得失，交戰營營，怒目揚聲，無儀多厭，冒寒暑而莫知，甘饑渴而不顧，盡日終宵，雖勞不怨，耗神殫力，自苦何辜！且因多寡傷朋友之情，競錙銖啟是非之釁，儒者惰業，農者失時，商者蕩資，工者怠事，耽者誤己，未有若此之甚者也。及其彼此息爭，勝敗攸判，得者不足以償勞，失者愈有以肌愕，割不忍之金，強慨然之態，久為囊物，頃付他人，趙璧隋珠，愛之不得，縱平日稱為至契者，欲假分文，勃然變色，雖赧顏屈節以求之，不可得也。此時此際，憂容可掬，哽氣頻呼，內訟默思，欲追無及，人亦何苦而自取如此耶！及其臨夜歸家，吞聲斂跡，含怨有僕，垢面有妻，子不為歡，母不為語，雖剩汁殘羹，亦一吸而盡。猶且多營處置一謀，將作恢復之計，夢魂顛例，博騁相從，甚者悲憤迭興，寢寐俱廢，禍由此釀，疾由此媒。反而思之，非不得已事也，人亦何苦而自迷若此耶！及其或稱貸於人，或沽典於己，急急孜孜，惟求再逞，飲食所在，若將不遑，視得若取諸寄也。豈知處既敗之勢難救，挾未盈之本無威，氣弱心荒，人皆可侮，猜紅覓六，十無一從，千方之所獲者，一旦失之而不足矣。屬望雖殷，徒為空想之跡，人亦何苦而自戚如此耶！及其黃昏將近，意興方濃，雖其心欲言旋，奈何勢不由己，索燭求油，拋家寄宿，致懸父母之憂思，因爽親朋之信約。遍尋無覓，童子倚門而迎，逐想難求，佳人守燈以待，吾方逞雄心，爭博手，囂囂然自以為樂也。身親不善，聚怨一門，反己懷慚，細思無益，人亦何苦而自玷如此邪！及其屢試不利，興阻於空囊，志縻於稍短，袖手傍觀，眼紅心熱，欲棄之則意有所難捨，將復之則力有所不能，躇躊莫決，如醉如癡，家事不支，非惟不復措念，縱一勉強為之，亦恍然若失矣。昏迷沉溺，戀戀不忘，俯首凴几，形影相弔，人亦何苦而自溺如此邪！又有一等奸險小人，專一伺訪良善，乘其可入之機，附以知己之列，言動之，利誘之，酒食結之，作阱成籠，不至於不入不已也，及其髻髮一把，釣鉺一吞，始之所言，毫不能應，虛利雖無，實禍先至，且彼機械熟於久煉，詭詐出乎多端，色有鉛沙，馬有脫注，雖號精敏者亦墮術中，況以愚弱之身而當彼無窮之計，則其勝負不待對局了然可卜矣，即運郭況之金穴，輸鄧通之銅山，日亦不繼，況其他乎！人反不悟於斯，必欲與之相驅騁焉：嗚呼！是猶石沒湍水，愈翻則愈沉也，羊觸藩籬，彌逞則彌困也，求其能濟事者，吾未之見也！已間或僥倖少得，人即怨尤，弱者引恨之以心，強者直拒之以色；又有狂罔之徒，從而訴於親，告於友，訟於官司，體面大傷，廉節盡喪，較之微利，孰重孰輕？嗚呼！辱害相繫必至於斯而猶不知悔，更將何待邪！又嘗知夫色也，古稱五白，戲始牧豬，無金玉之質，無耆宿之尊，無耳目之見聞，其初蠢然一骨耳。切磋焉，琢磨焉，斯是矣。至於投叱之下，偏能順小人、欺君子，宛轉隱見之間，欲少假借而一毫無所容其能，卒亦付之蠢然之骨耳！嗚呼！人靈萬物，乃遑遑焉仰求於蠢然之骨，而又為蠢然之骨所窘困，可哀也哉！故擇術貴精，與人貴正。苟不能擇而與之，一旦誤入於內，恬不知愧，及對達尊長者惟恐聞之，設若言友於此，亦仰面不敢贊一語。嗚呼！肆欲於朋淫之日而曲文於君子之前，將欲塞耳盜鈴、蒙頭操刃者等耳，欲人之不聞且見也，何可得哉！況乎此行一開，百惡皆萃，納污引侮，莫不由斯。賢者不為禮，富者不為托，智者目為愚，儉者鄙為敗，父母惡為不肖，鄉黨指為下稍，小競蠅頭，致庶眾謗，競者未實，謗者有加，嗚呼！以親黨不韙之名易難望之利，雖鄉人不為，而人竟甘冒，可悲也！夫自取自溺者既如此，可哀可悲者又如彼，然而斯人之耽且好者何哉？不曰仗此肥家，則曰冀此取樂，噫！陋哉！言之過矣。天下之利，何事無之？明經足以干祿，用武足以要封，鬻販足以盈資，桑麻足以廣積，皆事也，則皆利也，何以喪名節以求之乎？吾恐家未必肥，而空虛瘠弱之弊先速之矣，肥者果安在哉？天下之樂，何事無之？讀書可以開襟胸，彈琴可以怡性情，種花可以觀天機，養魚可以寄生意，皆事也，則皆樂也，何必冒污辱以求之乎？吾恐樂未必取，而憂愁抑鬱之思，先逼之矣，樂者固如此哉？況其轉展相尋間，彼此兩失，機杼脂膏暗鑠於囊頭之手，田桑汗血潛消於錄事之家，所謂鷸蚌相持，漁人得利，正謂此耳。盍不鑒諸古人乎？忿心生於傅殺。致殘鴻雁之情；淫行起於點籌，因造房幃之醜：樗蒲百萬，達者見機；坑塹二三，宦途有誚；家產之俱盡，桓溫幾喪溝渠；擔石之無儲，劉毅將為浪蕩；至於投馬以絕呼，亡羊以從事，四緋以彰快，孤注以明窮，不其枚舉，而其為累一也。自古迄今，遺聲尚臭，由今迨後，取法貴芳。故其白衣事省，黃口身閒，取此消遣，固無暇責矣。乃若言儒言，貌儒貌，服儒服，冠儒冠者，亦倡和成風，競相篤好，史籍詩書，束棄高架，雖蒙塵積垢，而心灰志奪，視如仇敵，小而人事禮文因之盡廢，及其較技掄選之時，風簷晷影之下，榮辱甚關，心手莫措，日之相與以為樂者，果能代我否邪？及今知改，則名可全，家可保，終身俊髦，苟遂昏迷，吾不知所了矣，何也？日月反照，無損於明；君子繩愆，不累其德。以陳元、周處之徒，尚自發憤改行，卒為善人，況吾輩號英達者不減元處，而未聞能自悔訟，豈以既招物議、改亦無救也歟？噫嘻！人孰無過，改之為難，過孰無因，原之為盡。向使商甲不悔桐墓，幾為暴桀之君；漢武不下輪台。則亦亡秦之續。孰為改之，功不既大哉！」
　　忠讀一過，悔歎移時。尋掘松根，得金一甕，皆刻告氏字，必忠高曾物也，此故後人無有知者。
　　再往二子家，探胡瞎一目，陸跛一足，頹然皆殲形矣。忠乃驚惶，自是絕不與相交接。
　　又以所得之資分人貨殖，後致大富。胡、陸二子，漸至窮迫，老年攜乞於途，人皆指以為鑒。仙師神報，亦顯矣哉！
　　琴精記　
　　鶴雲者，乃鄧州人，姓金也，美風調，樂琴書，為時輩所稱許。宋嘉熙間，薄游秀州，館一富家。其臥室貼近招提寺，夜聞隔牆有歌聲，乍遠乍近，或高或近。初雖疑之，自後無夜不聞，遂不以為意。
　　一夕，月明風細，人靜更深，不覺歌聲起自窗外。窺之，見一女子，約年十七八，風鬟露鬢，綽約有姿，疑是主家妾媵夜出私奔，不敢啟戶。側耳聽其歌曰：
　　「音、音、音，你負心，你真負心，孤負我，到如今，記得當時低低唱，淺淺斟，一曲值千金，如今寂寞古牆陰，秋風荒草白雲深。斷橋流水何處尋？淒淒切切，冷冷清清，教奴怎夢。」
　　女子歌畢，敲戶言曰：「聞君俊才絕世，故冒禁以相就。今乃閉戶不納，若效魯男子行邪？鶴雲聞言，不能自抑，才啟戶。女子擁至榻前矣。
　　鶴雲曰：「如此良夜，更會佳人，奈何燭滅樽空，不能為一款曲也？」女子曰：「得抱衾衣周，以薦枕席，期在歲月，何必泥於今宵？況醉翁之意不在酒乎！」乃解衣共入帳中，罄盡繾倦之樂。迨隔窗雞唱，鄰寺鐘鳴。女子起曰：「奴回也！」鶴雲囑之再至，女子曰：「勿多言，管不教郎獨宿。」遂悄悄而去。
　　次夜，鶴雲具灑饣肴以待，女子果來，相與並坐酣暢。女子仍歌昨文之辭，鶴雲曰：「對新人不宜歌舊曲，逢樂地詎所道憂情？」因更前韻而歌之曰：
　　音、音、音，知有心。知伊有心，勾引我到於今。最堪斯夕，燈前偶，花下斟，一笑勝千金。俄然雲雨異春蔭，玉山齊倒絳帷深。須知此樂更何尋。來經月白，去會清風，興益難禁。
　　女子聞歌，起而謝曰：「君子斯詠，可謂轉舊為新，除憂就樂也！」彼此歡情更濃於昨。自是無一夕不會。花苒半載，鮮有知者。
　　忽一夕，女子至而泣下。鶴雲怪問，始則隱忍，既則大慟。鶴雲慰之良久，乃收淚言曰：「奴本曹刺史之女，幸得仙術，優游洞天。但凡心未除，遭此謫降。感君同契，久奉歡娛。詎料數盡今宵。君前程遠大，金陵之會，夾山之游，殆有日矣！幸惟善保始終。」雲亦不勝悽愴，至四鼓，贈女子以金。別去未幾，大雨傾盆，霹靂一聲，窗外古牆悉傾例矣。鶴雲神魄飄蕩，明日遂不復留此。
　　二年後，富家築於基於，掘一石匣，獲琴與金，竟莫曉此故。時聞鶴雲宰金陵，悉其好琴，使人攜獻。鶴雲見琴光彩奪目，知非凡材，顧然受之，置於石牀。遠而望立，則前女子就而撫之；近而視之，則依然琴也。方悟女子為琴精，且驚且喜。適有峽州之遷，鶴雲得重疾，臨死命家人以琴合葬。琴精之言，一一驗矣。人有定數，物可先知，豈不信哉？　
　　竹帚精記　
　　洪武間，本覺寺有一少年僧，名湛然，房頗僻寂。一夕獨坐庭中，見一美女，瘦腰長裙，行步便捷，而妝亦不多飾。僧欲進問，忽不見矣。明夜登廁，又過其前。湛然急起就之，則又隱矣。他人處此，必不能堪，況僧乎？　
　　自是惶惑殊深，淫情交引，苦思不置。越兩日，又徐步於廁。僧急牽其衣，女復徉為慚怯之態。再三懇之，方與入室。及敘坐，僧復逼體近之，漸相調謔間，竟成雲雨。事畢，問其居址姓字，女曰：「妾乃寺鄰之家，父母鍾愛，嫁妾之晚。今有私於人。故數數潛出，不料經此，又移情於汝。然當緘密其事，則交可久。不然，彼此玷矣！」僧唯唯從命。於是，旦去暮來，無夕不會。
　　將及期，僧不覺容體枯瘦，氣息懨然，漸無生意。雖同袍醫治，百端罔功。寺中有一老僧謂曰：「察汝病脈，癆症兼致。陰邪甚盛，必有所致。苟不明言，事無濟矣！」淇然駭懼，勉述往事。眾曰：「是矣！然此祟不除，則汝恙不癒。今若復來，汝同其往，而蹤跡之，則治術可施也。」　
　　是夕，女至。湛然仍與交合。將行，欲起隨送。女止之曰：「僧居寂落，夜得美婦歡處，是亦樂矣！何苦自感如此。」湛然不能往，強而罷焉。翌日告眾，眾乃忖曰：「明夜彼來，當待之如常。密以一物，置其身。吾等游於房外，俟臨別時，擊門為約，吾等協當尾隨，必得而止，則祟可破矣！」湛然一一領記。
　　後一夕，湛然覺神思恍惚，方倚牀獨臥，女果推門復入。僧與私曲，益加溫存。雞鳴時，女辭去。僧潛以一花插女鬢上，又敲其門者三。眾僧聞擊聲，俱起追察，但見一女冉冉而去，眾乃鳴鈴誦咒，執錫執兵相與趕逐。直至方丈後一小室中乃滅，此室傳言三代祖定化之處。一年一開奉祭，餘時封閉而已。
　　眾僧知女隱跡，即踴躍破窗而入，一無所見，但西北佛廚後爍爍微光，即往燭光，則堅一竹質潤滑，枝束鮮瑩。蓋已數十年外物也，眾方疑惑，而花在柄，因共信之，乃持至堂前，抽折一，則水流滴地。眾僧益駭異。再折之，亦然，以至皆如之。
　　從僧乃明燈細視，其中排水，皆精也。湛然見之，悔悟驚懼，不能自制。於是，悉就焚之，揚灰於湖。湛然急以良劑調治，久之得平。而祟自此滅矣！　
　　評曰：異怪弄人，數固當滅，而少僧倖免，人亦可鑒。
　　天緣奇遇（上）　
　　祁羽狄，字子車酋，吳中杰士也。美姿容，性聰敏，八歲能屬文，十歲識詩律，弱冠時每以李白自期，落落不與俗輩伍，獨有志於翰林。每歎曰：「烏台青瑣，豈若金馬玉堂耶！」下筆有千言，不待思索。詩歌詞賦，奇妙絕例，且善鍾王書法，又粗知丹青。時人目為才子，多欲以女妻之，皆不應，其姑適廉尚，督府參軍也。姑早亡，繼岑氏，生三女，皆殊色。長曰玉勝，次曰麗貞，三曰毓秀，隨父任所，皆未適人。尚以衰老，乞骸骨歸。時生以父愛，家居寂寥，鬱鬱不快。或散步尋詩，寄身林壑，或操舟訪隱，傍水徘徊。一日，與蒼頭溜兒入市，見一婦人，年二十餘，修容雅淡，清芬逼人，立疏簾下，以目凝覷生。生動心，密訪之，乃吳氏，名妙娘，頗有外遇。生命溜兒取金鳳釵二股，托其鄰嫗饋之，妙娘有難色。嫗利生之謝，固強之。妙娘曰：「妾覷此郎果妙人也。但吾夫甚嚴，今幸少出，但一宿則可，久寓此，不宜也。」生聞之，即潛入，相持甚歡，極盡款曲。既枕上吟曰：
　　深深簾下偶相逢，轉眼相思一夜通；
　　春色滿衾香力倦，瘦容應怯五更風。
　　妙娘曰：「妾亦粗知文墨，敢以吳歌和之：
　　別郎何日再相逢，有時常寄便時風；
　　一夜恩情深似海，只恐巫山路不通。
　　歌罷，天色將曙，聞外扣門聲急。妙娘曰：「吾夫回矣。」與生急擁衣而起，開後門，求庇於鄰人陸用。用素與妙娘厚，遂匿之。
　　用之妻，周氏也，小字山茶，見生豐采，欲私之，生應命焉。茶曰：「吾主母徐氏新寡，體態雅媚，殊似玉人，坐臥一小樓，焚香禮佛，守法甚嚴，但臨風對月，多有怨態，知其心未灰也。妾以計使君亂之，可以盡得其私蓄。」生謝曰：「亂人之守，不仁；冀人之財，不義；本以脫難而又欲蹈險，不智。卿之雅情，心領而已。」言未畢，一少女馳至，年十三四，粉黛輕盈，連聲呼茶。見生在，即避入。生問：「此女何人」「茶曰：「主母之女文娥也。」生曰：「納聘否？」曰：「未也。」　
　　文娥入，以生達其母。母即自來呼之，且自窗處窺生。見生與茶狎戲，風致飄然，密呼茶，問曰：「此人何來？」茶欲動之，乃乘機應曰：「此吳妙娘心上人也。今礙有夫在，少候於此。」徐氏停眸不言久之，茶復曰：「此人旖旎灑落，玉琢情懷，窮古絕今，世不多見。」徐氏乃怒曰：「汝與此人素無一面，便與褻狎，外人知之，豈不遺累於我！」山茶亦佯作慍狀，對曰：「妾但不敢言耳。言之，恐主母見罪。」徐氏詰其故。山茶曰：「此人近喪偶，雲主母約彼前來偕老。」徐氏驚曰：「此言何來？」茶曰：「彼言之，妾信之。不然則主公所遺玉扇墜，何由至彼手乎？」徐氏即探衣笥中，果失不見，徘徊無聊又久之。山茶知其意，即報生曰：「娘子多上復：謹持玉扇墜一事，約君少敘，如不棄，當酬以百金。」生揣：「事由於彼，非我之罪也。」乃許之。－－蓋徐氏三日前理衣匣，偶遺扇墜於外，為山茶所獲。至是，即以此兩下激成，欲俟其處久而執之，以為挾詐之計耳。
　　近晚，生登樓，與徐氏通焉。繾綣後，徐氏問曰：「扇墜從何來？」生曰：「卿之所風賜，何佯問也？」徐氏曰：「妾未嘗贈君，適山茶謂君從外得者，妾以為然，故與君一敘。今乃知山茶計也。」徐氏悔不及，明早果以百金贈生行。生留一詞以別之，名《惜春飛》：
　　「乘醉蜂迷鶯不語，只是妙娘為主。玉墜憑誰取，又成紅葉偕鴛侶。兩地風流知幾許，自喜連遭奇遇。愁對傷處，何時得共枕，重相敘。」
　　徐氏恨山茶賣己，每以事讓之，茶不能堪，遂發其私，徐氏無了而富，族中爭嗣，因山茶實其奸，鳴之於官，官受嗣者賄，竟相法成案。徐氏以淫逐出，文娥以奸生女官賣，徐氏恥而自縊，生聞之，不勝傷痛，作輓歌以弔之曰：
　　「胡天不德兮，殲我淑人，情經一死兮，我重千金，花殲月缺兮，玉碎珠沉，俾生長夜兮，夢斷芳春。遭此仇兮，何所伸。欲排雲前代訴兮，奈力寡而未能。心耿耿兮思素恩，神恍惚兮懷舊跡。淚潸潸兮滴翠巾，悉鬱鬱兮欲斷魂。千回萬轉兮，痛我芳靈。靈其有知兮，鑒我微忱！」
　　生且泣且歌，不勝哽咽，乃散步林外，少放悶懷。不意新月印溪，晴煙散野，泉聲應谷，樹影墜地，生乃還步，踽踽獨行，悽慘愈切。忽聞後有環佩聲，生回顧，見一女子冉冉而來；後隨有女童，一掌扇，一執巾。生以為良家子也，意欲趨避。乃遙呼曰：「祁生何為避耶？」生疑為如戚，進步迎揖。然芳容奇冶，光彩襲人。生驚訝，未遑啟問，女即曰：「妾玉香仙子也。朝游蓬島，暮歸廣寒，拂扇則風行千里，揮巾則雲幔九宵，非俗女也。因與君有塵緣，到此一相會耳。」生聞其言，疑為鬼魅，不敢近，但唯唯求退而已。女笑曰：「妾乃不如徐氏耶？君子日後奇遇甚多，徐氏不足惜也。」即攜生手，同還生家。生聞其香氣清淑，愛其纖指溫潤，亦不甚怪。然而夜深人靜，重門自開，燈滅簾垂，明輝滿室，生雖疑，不能卻矣。與之共枕，頗覺綢繆。至五更，二女童報曰：「紫微登垣，壬申候駕。」女即整衣而起，與生別曰：「後六十年，君之姻緣共聚，富貴雙全，妾復來，與君同歸仙府矣。贈玉簪一根，扣之，則有厄即解：小詩一首，讀之，則終身可知。」言華，凌空而去。生望之，但見雲霓五彩，鸞鶴翩翔，生始信其為仙也。即視其詩，乃五言一律：
　　君是百花魁，相逢玉鏡台；
　　芳春隨處合，夤夜幾番災。
　　龍府生佳配，天朝賜妙才；
　　功名還壽考，九九妾重來。
　　生與玉香方合，精采倍常，穎悟頓速，衣服枕席，異香鬱然。人皆疑其變格，而不知生所自也。
　　時廉參軍致仕歸，泊船河下，聞文娥官賣，即以金償官，買與次女麗貞為婢。是日，生至講堂，適聞廉歸，驚曰：「此吾至親，別十年矣。」即趨謁。廉聞生至，急請入，各以久疏慰問。廉尚曰：「尊翁捐館，幸有子在。況子英發士也，但願早遂青雲以慰尊翁之志生謙謝久之。廉呼岑氏出，且曰：「祁三哥在此，非外人也。」岑氏謂三女曰：「三哥有兄弟情，可隨我見之。」惟麗貞辭以「曉起採茉莉花冒風，不快。」岑氏與玉勝、毓秀出見。生拜問起居，禮貌修整。岑見生閒雅，念：「得婿若此人，吾女何恨？」而勝與秀亦熟視生。生目玉勝妝豔，毓秀豐美，亦覺戚戚焉。廉問：「麗貞何在？」岑曰：「不快。」廉曰：「一別十年，今各長成，寧不一識面耶？」命侍女素蘭催之，不至。再命東兒讓之，麗貞不得已，斂髮而出。但見雲鬢半蓬，玉容萬媚，金蓮窄窄，睡態遲遲。生立俟之，自遠而近，停眸一覷，魂魄蕩然。相揖後，以序坐。岑以家事詰生，生心已屬麗貞，惟唯唯而已。頃間，茶至，捧茶者，文娥也。生見文娥，文娥目生，兩相疑喜。茶後，繼之以飯，岑與三女皆在座。岑曰：「三哥不棄，肯時來一顧乎？」廉曰：「吾欲以家事托子車酋，子車酋寧即去耶？」三女皆贊之。而麗貞又曰：「三哥倘以家遠不便，凡有所需，一切取之於妹。」生以麗貞之言深為有情，即以久住許之。
　　是夕，寄宿東樓。生開窗對月，巾周帳無聊，乃浩歌一絕以自遣云：
　　天上無心月色明，人間有意美人聲；
　　所需一切皆相取，欲取些兒枕上情。
　　生所歌，蓋思麗貞「一切取於妹」之言也。歌罷，見壁間有琴，取而撫之，作司馬相如《鳳求凰》之曲。不意風順簾間，樓高夜迥，而琴聲已淒然入麗貞耳矣。麗貞心動，密呼小卿，私饋生苦茶。生無聊間，見小卿至，知麗貞之情，狂喜不能自制，竟挽小卿之裙，戲曰：「客中人浼汝解懷，即當厚謝。」小卿拒，不能脫，欲出聲，又恐累麗貞；久之，小卿知不可解，佯問曰：「小姐輩侍妾多矣，倘舍妾，惟君所欲，何如？」生亦知其執意，乃難之曰：「必得桂紅，方可贖汝。」桂紅，乃玉勝婢。小卿曰：「桂紅為勝姐責遣，獨睡於迎翠軒，咫尺可得。」　
　　生與小卿挽頸而行，果一女睡軒下。生以為桂紅矣，舍小卿而就之，乃驚醒。非桂紅，乃素蘭也。蘭在諸婢中最年長，玉勝命掌繡工，一婢拙於繡，遷怒於蘭，責而逐之，不容內寢，怨恨之態，形於夢寐，適見生至，怪而問曰：「君何以至此也？」生不答，但狎之，蘭始亦推阻，既而歎曰：「勝姐已棄妾，妾尚何守！」遂納焉，生亦風流有情，而蘭亦年長有味，鴛衾顛例，不啻膠漆，生密問曰：「麗貞姐如何？」蘭曰：「天上人也。」曰：「可動乎？」曰：「讀書守禮，不可動也。且君兄妹，何起此心？」生愧而抱曰：「對知心人言，不覺吐露心腹。」既而問：「桂紅與誰同寢？」蘭曰：「桂紅，勝姐之愛婢也。此人聰慧，與文娥同學筆硯，今君以情鉤之，亦可狎者。」生甚喜，至天明就外，作一詞以紀其勝：
　　「素蘭花，桂紅樹，迎翠軒中，錯被春留住。乖巧小卿機不露，借風邀雨，脫殼金蟬去。一杯茶，咫尺路，卻似羊腸，又把車輪誤。且向桂花紅處吐，攀取高枝，再轉登雲步。」　
　　右調名《蘇幕遮》　　
　　生早與素蘭別時，天尚未明，偶遺汗巾一條，內包玉扇附並弔徐氏詞。小卿來喚素蘭，見而拾之，私示文娥曰：「此祁生物也。」文娥觀詞，不覺淚下。麗貞理妝，呼文娥代點鬢翠。文娥至，則秋波紅暈，淒苦蹙容。貞怪而問之。娥不能隱，以實告曰：「吾母死，皆為祁生。今見其弔母詞，是以不覺淚流。」麗貞素詞觀之，歎曰：「真才子也。」取筆批其稿尾：
　　「措詞不繁，著意更切。愁牽雲夢，宛然一段相思；筆弄風情，說盡百年長恨。誠錦心繡口，可愛可欽；必金馬玉堂，斯人斯職。然而月宮甚近，何無志於女亙娥？乃與地府通忱，實有功於才子。」　　
　　其所批者，亻敬其銳志功名，弗勞他慮；即令文娥持送還生。－－時廉有族中畢姻，夫婦皆往。－－生見文娥獨來，攜而歎曰：「兒何以至此耶？」娥惟嗟歎，道其所以，乃出扇墜、弔詞還生。生曰：「汝從何得之？」娥曰：「小卿自迎翠軒得之。今麗貞姐使妾奉還。」生且愧且謝。既而，見所批，又驚又喜，歎曰：「世間有此女子，羞殺孫夫人、李易安、朱淑貞輩矣。」讀至末句，歎曰：「吾妹真女亙娥也，僕豈無志耶！」送以末聯為有意於己，乃以白紗蘇合香囊上題詩一首，托文娥復之：
　　聊贈合香囊，慇懃謝贊揚；
　　弔詞知恨短，批稿辱情長。
　　愧我多春興，憐卿惜晚汝；
　　月宮雲路穩，願早伴霓裳。
　　麗貞見詩大怒。撻文娥；待父母歸，欲以此囊白之。毓秀知之，恐玷閨教，使二親受氣，急令潘英報生。時英年十七，亦老成矣，慮生激出他變，緩詞報曰：「秀姐知君有詩囊送入，甚是不足，乞入親謝之。」生笑曰：「秀妹年幼，亦知此味耶？」牽衣而入。秀以待於中門，以故告生。生驚曰：「何異所批！」秀曰：「彼儆君耳，非有私也。」生茫然自失。秀曰：「玉勝姐每愛兄，與妾道及，必致嗟歎；今在西鶴樓，可同往問計。」生含愧而進。玉勝見生，遠迎，曰：「三哥為何至此？」秀顧生，笑曰：「欲坐登雲客，先為入幕賓矣。」勝問其故。秀曰：「兄有『月宮雲路穩，願早伴霓裳』之句，遺於麗貞姐。貞姐怒，欲白於二親。今奈之何？」玉勝笑曰：「妾謂兄君子人，乃落魄子耶？請暫憩此，妾當為兄解圍。」即與秀往貞所。
　　貞方抱怒伏枕，勝徐問曰：「何清睡耶？」貞乃泣曰：「妹子年十七，未嘗一出閨門。今受人淫詞，不死何為！」勝與秀皆曰：「詞今安在？」貞不知勝為生作說客，即袖中以詩囊卷出。勝接手，即亂扯。貞怒，起奪之，已碎矣。貞益怒。勝曰：「三哥，才子也。妹欲敗其德，寧不自顧耶？」因舉手為麗貞枕花。低語曰：「三哥害羞，適欲自經。送人性命，非細事也。」貞始氣平。勝乃回顧素蘭，曰：「可急報三哥，貞妹已受勸矣。」　　蘭往，見生徘徊獨立，而桂紅坐繡於旁，亦不之顧，乃以勸貞事報生。生喜而謝之。蘭挽生，曰：「妾原謂此人不可動，君何不聽？」又背指紅，曰：「可動者，此也。為君洗慚可乎？」生又謝之。蘭附紅耳曰：「祁生反有意於子，今其慚忿時，少與款曲，何如？」桂紅張目一視而走。蘭追執之，罵曰：「我教汝繡，汝不能，則累我。我一言，即逆我，汝前日將勝姐金釧失去，彼尚不知，汝逆我，我即告出，汝能安乎？」若能依我，與祁生一會，即償前釧，不亦美乎？」桂紅低首無言，以指佛鬢而已。蘭撫生背，曰：「君早為之，妾下樓為君伺察耳目。」生抱紅於重茵上，逡巡畏縮，生勉強為之，不覺鬢翠斜欹，猩紅滿裼。
　　蘭下樓，因中門上雙燕爭巢墮地，進步觀之，不意勝，秀已至前矣。蘭不得已，侍立在旁，尊勝、秀前行，生聞樓上行聲，以為蘭也，尚摟紅睡；回顧視之，乃勝與秀。生大慚，勝大怒，即生前將紅重責，因抑生曰：「兄才露醜，今又若此，豈人心耶！」生措身無地，冒羞而出。無奈，乃為歸計。
　　明日，見廉夫婦，告曰：「久別舍下，即欲暫歸。」廉夫婦固留之。生固辭。乃約曰：「子車酋必欲歸，不敢強矣。待老夫賤旦，再勞枉顧，幸甚！」生謹領而別。途中無聊，自述一首：
　　「洛陽相府春如錦，亂束名花夜為枕。弄琴招得小卿來，迎翠先同素蘭寢。文娥痛而哭弔詞，麗貞題筆一贊之。牽惹新魂發新句，轉眼生嗔欲白之。絕處逢生得毓秀，恐玷閨門急相救。潘英邀我中門侍，西鶴樓前慚掩袖。玉勝頻呼入幕賓，相迎一笑問郎因。郎須少倚南樓坐，此去因先慰麗貞。麗貞見妹歡情復，桂紅巧繡嬌如玉。素蘭觀燕往中門，勝、秀登樓皆受辱。一場藉藉復一場，兩處相思兩斷腸。春光漏盡歸途寂。何日同棲雙鳳凰？」
　　麗貞小字阿鳳，故末句及之。
　　生去後，三女皆在百花亭看杜鵑花，東兒報曰：「祁君去矣。」勝與秀相對微笑，麗貞獨有憂色，停眸視花，吁歎良久，無非念生意也。玉勝不知，問曰：「妹子尚恨祁生耶？祁生果薄倖，昨觸妹，又辱桂紅。被污之女，不可近身，已托鄰母作媒出賣矣。」貞曰：「彼辱妹，姊尚容之；彼辱婢，姊乃不容耶？」玉勝語塞。蓋勝久欲私生，惟恐二妹忌之，又恨桂紅先接之也。
　　貞是夕凴欄對月，幽恨萬種，乃制一詞，名曰《阮郎歸》，自訴念生之情，每歌一句，則長吁一聲。文娥等侍側，皆為之唏噓：
　　「聞郎去後淚先垂，愁雲欺瘦眉。情深須用待佳期，郎心不耐遲。----香閨靜，寄新詩，眼前人易知。寸心相愛反相離，此情郎慢思。」　
　　生歸，不數日，為仇家蕭鶴者所誣，發生父未結之事。鶴以官豪，捕生甚急。生夜渡，欲往訴當道，為守渡者所覺，執送蕭氏。蕭層堂疊室，將生禁後房，待事中人至，即送官理。生夜靜忿鬱，無以自慰，忽憶仙子「玉簪解厄」之言，乃礻壽拜，吟一詞：
　　「撒天長恨幾時休？兩眼不勝羞。男兒壯年多困憂，何日一抬頭？----轍中鮒，雨中鳩，望誰周？橫鋪鐵網，高展金丸，畢何仇？」（《訴衷情》）
　　蕭之婦，于氏也，乃世家女，名金園。其夫名震，往京聽選。金園獨居，聞戶後歌聲悲切，明早，使侍女琴娘訪之，始知生故，歎曰：「與父有仇，子復何罪？」私遣琴娘以甘露餅十枚饋生。生謝曰：「此活命恩也，他日當銜環以報。」自後，琴娘時以飲食餉生，生媚意斂謝。琴娘悅之，因與之私，復乘間語金園曰：「此生溫如良玉，十倍吾主，今禁此，情甚可哀。」琴娘意欲釋之。金園曰：「昨亦夢神女命救此人，且云他日與汝皆當為彼侍妾，縱無此理，甚可疑也。」遂往窺之，果見生豐資穎異，氣宇溫容。抵夜，以別鑰啟鎖，匿入閨中，共枕恣欲。五更時，贈以白金十兩，金釧一雙，汗巾一條，與琴娘暗開重門，泣而送之，且以夢語生。生曰：「豈敢望此！僕有玉扇墜，今以贈卿，日後果有幸會，當以此為記。」遂拜謝而去。
　　翌日，蕭覓生，生已行矣。竟走京師，伏闕奏辨，為父雪仇。時趙子昂為翰林學士承旨，力贊生孝，得發御史觀音保等勘問，蕭懼，出萬金營求左丞相鐵木迭兒為之解紛息事，然亦不敢害生矣。
　　生由是避禍入山，發憤攻書。山下有名龔壽者，年六十，善相法，見生狀，知其不凡也，每以柴米給生，相過甚厚。生感以恩，乃書一聯於壁云：
　　遠移萍梗宜無地，近就芝蘭別有天。
　　又書一聯以自儆云：
　　身居逆境時勤讀，心到仇家夜夢親。
　　生去後，麗貞雖念生，不過形於詠歎而已。而玉勝則慕生之甚，言動如狂。每強扶倦態，對鏡畫眉，不覺長吁一聲，兩手如墜，日就枕席，飲食若忘，夢中忽忽如對人語，及醒，則揮淚滿牀而已，聞貞有《阮郎歸》調，令素蘭索之，貞不與，勝知其必為生作也，亦自作，調名《桃源憶故人》，亦道望生之意：
　　「思思念念風流種，心為愁深如夢，繡衾象牀如共，羞把寒衾擁。----桂紅樓上春心動，悔己多情殘送。卻笑自家愁重，番作巫山夢。」　
　　廉至旦日，遣人邀生，知生受誣奏辯，嗟歎久之。及生入山讀書，廉遣人送白金五兩，白米六包，與生少資日用。玉勝自忖曰：「祁生發憤，招之則不來，然其意惟在麗貞，詐招以貞書，或得一面。」乃具書，私付去人，且戒之曰：「此麗貞書，密與之。」　　
　　小妹麗貞斂衽端肅拜：疇昔之心，豈敢自昧；擲詩之忿，實懼人知。月色空梁，不見知心到眼；風聲泣樹，徒知弱態傷神。近知往復大仇，識英才之可羨；今又入山憤志，知力學之有成。但情在寸心，終難自慰；人遙千里，豈易相通！滿目雲山，何處是鳳凰棲止；一天星斗，幾時成牛女歡期？頃刻相思，須更長歡。倘兄肯顧片時，小妹終身佩德。匆匆草字欠恭，伏乞情恕。不備。
　　妹貞再拜啟。
　　生得書，驚喜雀躍。然發憤之始，義不可行；欲復書，又恐廉知，但私寄曰：「為我多多附謝小姐，書已領教矣。」生是日舊態復萌，幾不自制，大書絕句於壁：
　　海樣相思思更深，一封珍寶抵千金。
　　書中總有顏如玉，未必如渠滿我心。
　　一日，龔老訪生，見壁上絕句，問曰：「君有所思乎？讀書之心，如明鏡止水，倘有所思，則芥蒂多矣，安能有成？」祁生不覺汗顏。龔復慰曰：「少年人多有此弊，況君未娶，宜不免此：老夫相君目秀眉清，天庭高聳，必享大貴。倘不棄，老夫有一小女，名道芳，頗端重寡言，亦宜大福，他日願為箕帚，何如？」生愧謝不已。
　　是歲，生起小考，補郡庠弟子員。
　　後數日，生整衣冠，往拜廉。廉一家慰賀。三女出見，皆曰：「恭喜！」即宴生於怡慶堂，笙歌交作，酬酢疊行。至晚，銀燭滿堂，侍女環立，廉夫婦已醺，而生猶未醉。岑命三女以次奉生酒。玉勝舉杯近生，語云：「妾有言，幸君弗醉。」蓋欲私生也。生不知，應曰：「已酩酊矣。」麗貞舉杯戲生曰：「新秀才請酒。」生亦笑曰：「何不道新郎飲酒？」貞愧而退，怒形於色。毓秀見貞不悅，及舉杯奉生，乃曰：「兄何以言，使貞姐含怒？」蓋生以前所寄書有情，故量其易而忽之，不知其為玉勝計也。夜深散罷，生被酒，寢外館。勝自往呼之，生不醒。勝恐館童來覓，長吁而返，悶倚銀钅工，形影相弔，口占一詞，且泣且訴：
　　「何事無情貪睡，席上分明留意。指日望郎來，要說許多心事。沉醉，沉醉，不管斷腸流淚。」（調名《如夢令》）
　　生明早入謝酒，廉夫婦未起，獨麗貞立簷前喂鸚鵡，亦未理妝生前，戲曰：「蒙見召，今至矣。」麗貞默然。生曰：「何其不踐書中之言乎？」貞曰：「妾未曾有書，兄何詐也？」生出書示之，乃玉勝之筆。貞大怒。生見貞不梳不洗，雅淡輕盈，清標天趣，如玉一枝，因笑解其怒，而突前抱曰：「縱非子書。天緣在矣。」時生精魄搖蕩，心膽益狂，蓋欲一近貞香，而死亦自快也。貞力掙不能脫，乃定氣告曰：「妾非無心者，亻且兄妹不宜有此。況兄未有妻，妾未受聘，何不一通媒妁，偕老百年，非良便乎？」適鸚鵡見生將貞抱扭，作人聲詈曰：「姐姐打，姐姐打！」其聲甚急，生恐人至，脫貞而出。
　　然生之入也，玉勝乘人未起，早就生寢，欲了此念。見生不在，即為詩一首以示之：深院春風急，吹花入翰林。
　　無緣空去也，留此寄知音。
　　玉勝留詩而出，過中門，聞行步聲，遙視之，即生也。以手招生，生急至。勝曰：「無情郎從何來？」生以麗貞寄書事告勝。勝曰：「實妾為之，非貞也。」即邀生同入含春庭後，就大理石牀解衣交頸，水滲桃花，並枕顛鸞，風搖玉樹，香滴滴露滋金蓋，思昏昏骨透靈酥。
　　時紅日漸高，毓秀已起，恐生苦宿酒，令東兒饋生以茶。東兒至生館，但見一詩在几，寂無人跡。東兒取詩還報曰：「祁生不知何往，但見几上此紙耳。」秀觀之，歎曰：「勝姐作不規矣。」　
　　時生與勝交散，各喜不為人知。勝理妝後作一詞以紀其樂云：（名曰《蝶戀花》）　　
　　「風動花心春早起，亭後空牀，一枕鴛鴦睡，歸到蘭房妝倦洗，幾回又掬相思水，　　但願風流長到底，莫使人知，都在心幾里，郎至香閨非遠地，幸郎早辦通宵計。」　　
　　勝以詞使素蘭寄生，且囑生將几上詩毀之。生見詞甚喜，然几上詩未之有也。生語蘭曰：「向曾許桂紅，代償金釧一雙。」並和前詞，以復勝：
　　「蝶醉花心飛不起。轉過春亭，又把花枝睡。昔因採桂羞難洗，歸家掬盡相思水。----今日好花開到底。苦盡甘來，盡在心兒裡。又願春光同兩地，勝如雲路平生計。」　　
　　蘭笑曰：「『春光兩地』，君得隴又望蜀耶？」生曰：「非子不能知此趣也。」蘭復勝，勝以為几上詩生匿之矣。
　　不意毓秀以詩示麗貞，貞亦以勝假書之故告秀。二人謀，欲露之。麗貞又念敗生之德，不復在坐，欲行欲止，持於兩疑。秀曰：「今母晝寢，以書置母枕旁，母起見之，但知姊之私蕩耳，不復知我計也。況紙上又無稱號，亦豈累祁生耶？」麗貞曰：「善。」秀往置之，立侯母醒。文娥竊知秀事，私達於生。生曰：「事急矣！」入告於勝。勝曰：「秀立閒前，何以竊之？」生曰：「秀之所為，貞使之也。文娥，則貞好也，托文娥以貞命呼秀，秀必出矣。使先使素蘭隱於門後，俟秀出，蘭即入取之。」勝曰：「計雖妙，奈文娥不肯何！」生曰：「娥之母，我故人也。彼念其母，必肯念我。」呼文娥語之，果如命詣秀，曰：「貞姐有言，急請一面。」秀出見貞，貞亦晝寢；秀急候母，詩已去矣。秀以文娥誘之，使貞責之。文娥懼，乘夜而逃，不知所之。玉勝得詩而恨二妹之共計也，作《風雨恨》一篇，以記其怒：
　　「風何狂，雨何驟，妒花不管花枝瘦。花瘦亦何妨，深嗟風雨忙。風不歇，雨不竭，同枝花，自搖折。幸得東皇巧護遮，風風雨雨曲欄斜。花枝不放春光漏，依舊清香到碧紗。」
　　一日，麗貞在碧雲軒獨坐凴欄，放聲長歎。生自外執荷花一枝過軒，見貞長歎，緩步踵其後。貞低首微誦曰：「本待將心托明月，誰知明月照溝渠！」生輕撫其背，曰：「明月是誰？」貞驚，起拜，遮以別言，但問曰：「此花何來？」生曰：「自碧波深處，愛其清香萬種，故下手採之。」貞曰：「兄但能摘水中花耳。如天上碧桃，日中紅杏，不與兄矣。」生曰：「碧桃、紅杏，恨未開耳。倘香心少放，敢不效峰蝶憑虛向花間一飽耶？」貞曰：「飽則飽矣，但恐飽後忘花耳。」生以荷花擲地，誓曰：「如有所忘，即如此花橫地。」貞含笑以手拾花，戲曰：「映月荷花，自有別樣紅矣。兄何棄之？」正談笑間，玉勝自門後見之，欲壞麗貞，報母曰：「碧雲軒甚有風，娘可往坐。」岑至軒，見生與貞笑語迎戲，乃發聲大怒。自是，貞不復出，生亦遠避西園矣。
　　生依依此情，每日入夢寐之態，形之於詩：
　　長夜如年客裡身，短衾消盡枕邊春；
　　晴江寂寞無心月，鄉夢流連得意人。
　　幾度覺來渾不見，卻才眠去又相親；
　　空親恍惚非真會，贏得相思淚滿巾。
　　又五言一絕，又夢麗貞所作也：
　　閒題心上事，空憶夢中人。哪得溫如玉，慇懃一抱春。
　　勝既敗貞，尤不能忘秀也，乃誘秀曰：「西園蓮實茂盛，妹肯往一採乎？」秀未老成，樂於遊戲，即欲往。勝曰：「妹與東兒先往，我收拾針線即來。」秀果先去。勝度秀與生會，不免接談，乃告其母曰：「秀往採蓮，乞令人一看。」岑每溺愛秀，聞秀出，即呼麗貞，同往西園。及至，見生與秀共拍一蝶，奔馳謔笑；生將得蝶，秀與東兒就生共奪之，岑罵曰：「此豈兒女事耶！」生大慚，知岑必見疑，乃告歸。
　　秀見貞隨母，以為貞計也，甚恨之。反訴於玉勝。勝以為得計，復執之，秀深信矣。自是，秀以心腹待勝，事事皆勝聽矣。
　　勝是夜招生共寢，生以屢敗，不敢往，以詩別之：
　　花開漏盡十分春，更有何顏見玉人？　
　　明明馬蹄誰是伴，野橋流水悶愁云。
　　勝得詩，知生決行，以玉臂一副、簪一根、琴一囊、錦一匹，並和生詩以贈之：
　　細雨斜風促去春，有情人送有情人。
　　偷閒須辦來時計，莫使紅妝盼白云。
　　生回，雖感勝厚情，尤以麗貞為念，心甚怏怏，居家無聊，飲食俱廢，臨風對月，悽慘不勝。有一友，姓霍，名希賢。見生不快，扯生往妓家一樂。妓者王瓊仙，生舊人也，見生至，甚喜，戲曰：「貴人鄭重，何人不求？」生不答。瓊仙又叩之，生唯唯而已，雖樽俎間瓊仙以百計挑之，生但低首吟哦，情思恍惚。瓊仙固留生宿，生不得已，應之。枕席間，生毫不措意。瓊仙欲動其心，夜半呼義妹等，並作一牀，恣意承順。生雖雲雨，意自茫然。瓊仙曰：「君似有心事，何不對妾一言？」生曰告以麗貞未就之故。瓊仙曰：「非廉氏阿鳳乎？」生曰：「何以知之？」曰：「昨在竹副使家侍宴，有一客欲為竹公子作媒，是以知之。今君遇此，妾等不敢近矣。」生曰：「廉有三女，長女未受聘，何先及次女？」曰：「必欲求之，多在長女。」言未畢，溜兒馳報曰：「宗師案臨，宜往就試。」　
　　生歸，即赴試。廉知之，遣人饋贐。三女皆私有所贈。生登領，作詞分謝之。詞名《畫堂春》，謝廉尚參軍：
　　「孤身常托舊門牆，此恩海樣難量。又須豐贐實行囊，書劍生光。----深夏暫違顏范，新秋便揖華堂，時來倘試綠羅裳，展草垂韁。」
　　謝玉勝詞，名曰《玉樓春》：
　　「含春笑解香羅結，相思只恐旁人說。腰肢輕展血傾衣，朱唇私語香生舌。----無端又為功名別，幾回夢轉肝腸裂。囑卿休作倚門妝，新秋共泛歸舟月。」
　　謝麗貞詞，名曰《小重山》：
　　「楊柳垂簾綠正濃。碧去軒內，情語喁喁。玉人長歎倚欄東。知音語，惹動芰荷風。----猛地見慈容。總然好多意，也成空。相思今隔小山重。承佳貺，盡在不言中。」　　
　　謝毓秀詞，名曰《卜算子》：
　　「惜別似傷春，春住人難住。蝴蝶紛紛最惱人，總把春推去。記取碧苔陰，勝似青雲路。愁壓行邊憶心人，未走先回顧。」
　　生擇日與溜兒就程。行至中途，天色已晚，寄宿一旅中。溜兒先睡，生溫習經書。夜分時，聞隔牆啼泣悲切；四鼓後，聞啟門聲。生疑，先潛出俟之，見一女子，年可十五六，掩淚而行。生尾之。至河上，其女舉身赴水。生執之，叩其故。女曰：「妾家本陸氏，小字嬌元，為繼母所逼，控訴無門，惟死而已。」言罷，又欲赴水。生解之曰：「芳年淑女，何自苦如此！吾勸若母，當歸自愛。」女曰：「如不死，有逃而已。」生憐之，欲與俱去。但溜兒在本家，欲還呼之。女曰：「一還則事泄矣，則妾不可救矣。顧此失彼，理之常也，願君速行。」生見其哀苦迫遽，乃棄溜兒，與女僦一小舟，從小路而行。
　　一日，天色將晚，舟人曰：「天黑路生，不宜前往。」生從之。停舟蘆沙中，與女互衣而寢，情若不禁，生委曲慰之。女曰：「妾避死從君，此身已玷，幸勿以淫奔待之，庶得終身所托矣。」生指天日為誓。女喜，作詩謝之：
　　啼愁欲赴水晶宮，天遣多情午夜逢；
　　枕上許言如不改，願公一舉到三公。
　　吟畢，生方欲和韻，女側耳聞船後磨斧聲急，與生聽之，驚起。問曰：「磨斧為何？」舟人應曰：「汝隻身何人？乃拐人女子。天使我誅汝。」蓋舟人愛嬌元之美，欲誅生以奪之也。生驚怖，計無所出。乃舟人已有持斧向生狀。生躍入水，口呼：「救命！」忽蘆叢旁有人應聲而起，即以長竿挽生之髮救之。生不得死。舟人見生救起，隨棄舟下水逃去。而嬌元亦無恙，反得一舟矣。
　　二舟相並，舉火問名。舟中有一婦，問曰：「君非祁生乎？」生曰：「何以知之？」婦出舟相見，乃吳妙娘也。妙娘喪夫，改適一巨商，商與妙娘載貨過湖，亦宿於此。商問妙娘曰：「汝何識祁？」妙娘曰：「親也。」商以為真，遂相款焉。
　　明早，妙娘私饋生白金一錠，生謝別。然不能操舟，與嬌元坐帆下，惟風之所之。行一日，止十餘里。
　　近晚，泊湖上。嬌元方淅米為餐，岸上忽呼曰：「死奴！至此耶？」生起而視之，乃昨逃去舟人也。生知不免，即跳岸疾馳，幾為追及，舟人尾生終日，饑不能前，故得免焉。
　　生縱步忙投，不知所之，遙見一叢林，急投之，乃道院也。生扣門入，見一道姑，挑白蓮燈迎問所自來。生具述其故，道姑曰：「此女院，恐不便。」生曰：「殿宇下少憩，明早即行。」既而，又一青衣至，附耳曰：「此生頗飄逸，半夜留之，人無知者。」道姑憮然，乃曰：「先生請進內坐。」生進揖，問姓，道姑曰：「下姓沙，法名宗淨，年二十有七。」有道妹曰涵師，年二十有二，亦令見生。因與共坐，清氣襲人，香風滿席。生見涵師談傾珠玉，笑落瓊瑤，思欲自露其才，乃請曰：「僕避難相投，自幸得所，皆神力也。欲作疏詞，少陳慶扼，不亦可乎？涵師曰：「先生有速才能即構乎？」生曰：「跪誦而已，何假構耶？」涵師喜，即引生拜於禪燈之下。生起焚香，應口而讀，聲如玉磬，清韻悠然：
　　伏以乾坤大象，羅萬籟以成一虛；日月重光，溥八方而回四序。塵中山立，去外花明。擲玄鶴於九天，遙迎聖駕；跨青牛於十島，近拜仙旌。羽狄一介書生，五湖逸士。欲向金門射策，逆旅奇逢；誰知畫舫無情，暴徒禍作。幸中流之得救，苦既迫而不追。四野雲迷，一身無奈；兩間侷促，一死何辭。不意天啟宿緣竟得路投勝院，清淡淡坐，山皓齒之素書。綠鬢挑燈，指黃冠之羽扇。儼乎仙境，恍若洞天。拘禁不祥，瞻仰日星之照耀。消磨多瘴，恭逢雅妙以周旋。謹拜清辭，上於天聽。祈求祿佑，下護愚生。
　　讀畢，師等贊曰：「君奇才也。」因舉酒酌賡，稍及褻語。宗淨舉手托生腮曰：「君雖男子，宛若婦人。」涵師曰：「夜深矣！」共起邀生同入共枕雲雨，各自溫存，不惜精力。而涵師肌膚瑩膩，風致尤高。自是晝以次陪生，夜則連衾共寢。重門扃固，絕無人知。
　　生一夕月下步西牆，聞誦經聲甚嬌，乃吟詩以戲之曰：
　　沙門清月水花多，讀罷禪經夜幾何？　
　　嬌舌強隨空色轉，其心皆作死灰磨。
　　玄機參透青蓮偶，悔悟應和白苧歌。
　　卻與維摩作相識，不憐牆外病東坡。
　　隔牆誦經者即文娥也。昔外出，入此庵為西院主興錫之弟。聞生吟詩，驚曰：「此祁郎聲也！何以至此。」追思往事，不覺長吁，亦朗吟一詩以試之：
　　為君偷出枕邊情，玉勝愁消毓秀嗔。
　　脫卻紅塵今到此，隔牆好似舊時人。
　　生聞詩甚疑。明早潛訪之，見文娥，相持悲咽，各問來歷。生曰：「僕累卿逃，不意又復見卿，真夙世緣也！」文娥之師興錫見生閒雅，悅而匿之。生過幾日又到宗淨處，西院羈留，樂而忘返。
　　不意溜兒為陸氏失女，執送於官。而生為色所迷，試期已過，不復他念。日與涵師等劇飲賦詩，不能盡述。姑記與興錫等詩云：
　　苦海回頭便是家，春驚鐵樹報瓊花。
　　日光飛出塵中馬，風力平收水底霞。
　　丹爐有煙終是火，藍田無玉豈生芽。
　　從今氵迭髓留玄骨，不向玄門覓豔葩。
　　《題性纟玄齋壁》　　
　　不是凡民不是仙，壺中日月壺中天。
　　青山綠水皆為友，野鳥名花盡有緣。
　　林壑寄身閒似鶴，齋居養性莫如纟玄。
　　羽衣華髮成瀟灑，坐看芳溪放白蓮。
　　《題宗淨山房》　　
　　兩兩山離報好音，壘壘白石點疏林。
　　谷中鹿豕防人眼，壁上藤蘿礙日陰。
　　無伴空懸徐孺榻，有香還撫伯牙琴。
　　馮渠海沸天雷發，淨拂蒲園抱膝吟。
　　一日，兩院道姑皆往一寡婦家作齋事，獨留文娥伴生。生欲私之，娥曰：「妾見眾道姑日夜縱淫，唯妾居此甚苦。得君帶歸，敢惜一共枕耶？」生曰：「我在此甚無益，思歸亦切矣！豈忍棄卿？」因摟娥，撤其衣，舉身就之。時文娥年十七，一近一避，畏如見敵，十生九死，痛欲消魂，不覺雨潤菩提，花飛法界好事畢，生曰：「卿他日肯為麗貞作媒乎？」娥曰：「貞甚有情，況今年長，亦易亂之，君肯歸，不必慮也！」自是，生與娥密為歸計矣。
　　眾姑自齋回，見生有歸意，百計留之，無以悅生者，適有女童持禮來，揖眾姑而去，生問何人，宗淨曰：「是前作齋事家使女金菊也。」生微笑。宗淨疑生悅菊，即歆之曰：「君肯安心寓此，當及其主母，況此婢耶？」生問主母為誰，淨曰：「辛太守之妻陳氏也。年雖四十而貌甚少年，今寡居數月矣。今擇本月十五日來院炷香，我輩當以酒醉之，強留宿院。睡熟時，君即近之。倘事諧，則太守有一妾名孔姬，亦以網跨下矣。」生如其言。
　　至十五日，陳果被酒，假宿院中。宗淨以雞子清輕輕污其便處，如受感狀。陳覺醒之，疑為男子所淫。開帳急呼金菊，不意菊亦被誘別寢。但見一燈在几，生笑而前。陳歎曰：「妾欲守志終身，不意為人所誘。」生捧其面勸曰：「青春不再，卿何自苦如此？」即解衣逼之，陳亦動情，竟納焉。生多疲於色，而精力不長。陳久寡空房，而所欲未足。乃約生曰：「妾夾間暗歸，君可隨我混入。」　
　　生如其言，至陳家。孔姬尚睡中，陳欲並亂之，以杜其口，即枕前語曰：「汝覺吾？我帶一伴客相贈。」孔醒見主，即有怒狀。陳以勢壓之，終不從。生與陳處，凡十餘日，終亦礙孔，不得肆志。
　　乃晝，一春意於孔姬寢壁，因題一詞以動之，名曰《魚遊春水》。
　　風流原無底，一著酥胸情更美。玉臂輕抬，不覺雙亻免起。展亂薔薇錦一機，搖播楊柳絲千縷。好似江心魚遊春水。----你也危樓獨倚，辜負紅顏誰為主，徒然曉夢醒時，慵妝倦洗。玉簫長日閒，孤鳳翠衾，終夜無鴛侶。這等淒涼，誰為羨爾！
　　孔姬覽之，心少動。一日，生與金菊晝淫於雙柏軒，而菊之同輩皆就之。三女一男，爭春似滾；四衣五形，展錦如平。孔姬自簾後視之，情遂恍惚，不能自守，乃緩步進曰：「郎君入花絲矣！」生曰：「清自清，濁自濁，卿自守足矣，何阻人興耶？」孔笑曰：「妾請償之可乎？」生曰：「卿回心尚何論耶！」遂與通焉。生喜作一詞以謝之，名《浣溪紗》：
　　　　
　　獨抱幽香不傲春，而今春色破梨雲，算來清淨總無真。
　　正做百花叢裡客，卻逢千想意中人，謹托新詞當謝親。
　　時宗淨與涵師等謀曰：「我輩欲留祁君，故以陳夫人悅之。今祁乃戀陳，不復顧我矣！為今之計，共往擒之。陳若掩爭，必得其財。祁與彼絕，必來我院，不兩利乎？」興錫曰：「祁君智士也。倘事泄先行，我輩空望矣。必先令一人，假宿於彼。我輩夜半圍門，裡通外應，無失算也。」眾稱善，欲擇一人先往。娥乃進計曰：「弟子與祁鄉裡，祁必不疑，弟子願以抄化為名，入陳寢所，為眾師內應。」師等信而遣之。文娥往見陳於萱壽堂，方與生並坐。文娥曰：「久居於此，郎君樂乎？」復以眼私揆生。生乃舍陳等獨步亭後，文娥尾生。告曰：「今晚事壞矣！」生問其所以，娥告以故，且曰：「妾與君急為歸計，庶可自全。」生點首數次，計無所出。久之，往語陳曰：「院中邀僕一茶，去當即來。」陳即使金菊隨去，促之早還。生與娥、菊同就路，娥曰：「夫人欲使郎早還，菊姐可先往，免使人生疑矣！」生知娥意，乃力贊之。菊信而先行。娥乃挽生即從別路遠遁。菊至院，久候不至，乃返。師等為陳賣已。而陳又為院中潛謀，互相成隙，自易各相為謀矣。
第八卷    
　　天緣奇遇（下）　
　　時祁生與文娥得脫歸，即投廉宅。廉自溜兒成獄，知生路中失所，以為不相面矣，今復得見，而又見文娥，舉家甚喜。及麗貞、秀出，爭問：「久寓何地？且何以得遇文娥？」生一一道其所以，眾皆驚歎。及不見玉勝，生問其故，乃知嫁竹副使子矣。悵然久之。至晚就館，百念到心，撫枕不寐，乃構一詞，我曰《憶秦娥》：
　　「空碌碌，春光到處人如玉。人如玉，舊時姻緣，何年再續」　
　　阿鳳猶自眉兒蹙，文娥已許通心腹。通心腹，幾時消了，新愁萬斛？」
　　生晚睡起，才披衣坐牀上，聞推門聲，開帳視之，乃毓秀也。秀笑語生曰：「勝姐多致意，出閣時腸斷十回，魂消半晌，皆為兄也。有書留奉，約兄千萬往彼一面。」生見秀窈窕，言語動人，恨衣服未完，不能下牀，乃自牀上索書。秀出書，近牀與之。生即舉手鉤秀頸，求為接唇。秀力掙問，忽聞人聲，始得脫去。生開緘視之，書曰：
　　「兄去後，妾頃刻在懷。仰盼歸期，再續舊好。不意秦晉通盟，相思愈急。故人千里，會晤無時。幸秀妹為妾心腹，勸妾且從親命。妾嘗亦勸秀善事吾兄，莫負少年。秀亦鍾情者也。妾與兄枕邊私愛，帳內溫存，今皆已付秀矣。兄善為之，妾復何言。但此心常懸懸，欲得一面。兄無棄舊之心，妾有倚門之望。誠肯慨然再顧，實出尋常之萬萬也。」　
　　勝在家時，與秀為心腹，每以生風致委曲形容，秀必停眸拊胸，坐起如醉，惟以生不歸為恨。及時，生得書，知勝之薦秀也，乃舍所遺珠翠，自進還秀，且以勝書示之。秀佯怒曰：「我亦如勝姐耶！」撇生而去。
　　生無聊，往坐迎暄亭。天陰欲雪，寒氣侵入。文娥過亭，見生嗟歎，以為慕麗貞也。正欲動問，貞早已至生後。生不知貞來，長歎一聲，悲吟四句：
　　風觸愁人分外寒，潸然紅淚濕欄杆。
　　凍雲阻盡相思路，梅骨蕭蕭瘦不堪。
　　麗貞輕撫生背，曰：「兄苦寒耶？」生驚顧，一揖，應曰：「苦寒不妨，苦愁難忍耳。」貞因拉生共擁爐。生坐火前，以箸畫灰，愁思可掬。貞佯問曰：「兄思歸耶？」曰：「非也。」又笑而問曰：「為那人不在耶？」生曰：「眼前不尚如此，去人何暇計耶！」貞曰：「妾未嘗慢兄，兄何出此言！」生曰：「僕每失言，卿即震怒，尚非慢乎？」貞笑曰：「信有之，今不復然矣。」生曰：「彼此有心，已非朝夕，千愁萬恨，竟貽空言。今試期又將迫矣，一去再回，便隔數月，卿能保其不如玉勝之出閣乎？」貞低首不答。生因促膝近貞，懇其不言之故。貞歎曰：「妾一見君，即有心矣，豈敢自昧？但恐鮮克有終，作一笑柄耳。」生長歎曰：「事慮至此，終不諧矣。」適文娥自外執並蒂橘二枚進曰：「二橘頗似有情。」生曰：「有情不決，亦安用哉！」貞笑曰：「決亦甚易，但恐根不固耳。」文娥知二人意，因謂曰：「妾知貞姐與君思欲並蒂久矣，但君欲速成，貞恐終棄，是以久疑。妾今為二人決之。」謂：「二人各出所有以訂盟，作為長計，不亦可乎？」生曰：「善。」即剪一指甲付貞，祝曰：「指日成親，百年相守。」貞乃剪髮一縷付生，祝曰：「青髮付君，白頭相守。」文娥曰：「妾請為盟主。」因取橘分贈二人，祝曰：「決成連理，並蒂同春。然佳期即在今晚矣，有背盟者，妾當首出。」貞首肯之。
　　生喜而出，縱筆作一詞，名曰《好事近》：
　　「好事謝文娥，便把眼前為約。準備月明時，獲取個通宵樂。」　
　　天生雙橘蒂相連，喚醒相思魄。得到錦衾香久，把親相與著。」
　　生把筆間，適潘英持一盒至，云：「秀姐饋君金橘與生啟盒。」又書：
　　甜脆柔資滲齒香，數顆珍重贈祁郎。
　　肯將此味心常記，願付高枝過短牆。
　　生見詩，知秀亦有允意，驚喜過望。潘英索生和韻以復，生狂喜不能執筆。英促之，生曰：「詩興不來，奈何？」英又促之，生曰「汝為發興，可乎？」英不答。生閉門，抱英入幕，狂興一番，不覺過度。英曰：「來久矣，恐見疑。君既無詩，當自入謝之。」生有恍惚態，英苦促之，乃迎風而行。至秀所，秀已為母呼去矣。生又迎風而出，遂患寒熱。又思赴約，愈覺憔悴，疾益加甚。
　　是夜，秀與貞各料生必來，兩處皆待。明早，知生病，咸往視之。生咄咄不能言，惟流涕而已。貞、秀執生手，各悲咽不勝。貞伏生胸前，慰曰：「天相吉人，兄當自愈。好事多磨，理固然也。」頃間，岑氏至，二女退。岑命以湯藥治之，生少愈。廉知之，謂岑曰：「子車酋有恙，可移入迎翠軒便於調養。」　
　　迎翠軒，益近二女寢所。一日，岑之父母慶壽，請岑並二女。岑以家事不能盡去，而生又養病內軒，無人調理，命秀掌家，與貞同去。生自是得秀溫存，無所不至。生病十去八九。
　　一夕，以淫事戲秀。秀約曰：「燈滅時，兄可就妾寢所，妾先睡俟之。」及秀將寢，愧心復萌，而又念生新愈，恐逆其願，乃呼東兒詐睡己之牀，且戒之曰：「倘露機，汝即一死。」東兒從之。乃生至，以為真秀也，款款輕輕，愛之如玉。生呼之，不應；以事語之，不答。生以其害羞，不疑。至早，求去，生挽之，且曰：「舉家無人，何必早起？」留之數四，天將明矣。生開帳視之，乃東兒也。生微微冷笑，東兒亦含笑而去。
　　生起，見秀，戲曰：「卿非紀信，乃能誑楚。」秀謝罪不已。生曰：「東兒作贈頭可也，卿能免耶？」秀不答，惟曰：「天寒，少坐可乎？」生曰：「可。」秀命潘英治酒，與生對飲，每杯各飲其半，情興甚濃。生以眼撥東兒出，東兒轉手閉門而去。生抱秀，勸與之合。秀曰：「待晚。」生曰：「晚則又倩人耶？」半推半就，覺酒興之愈濃；且畏且羞，苦春懷之無主。榴裙方卸，桃雨作斑。眼氵蒙蒙而玉股齊彎，魂飄飄而舌尖輕吐。秀思生病，加意護持；生戀秀嬌，傾心顛倒。雖精神之有限，雜欲罷而不能。頃之，東兒至。生拂衣而起。東兒歎曰：「今得新人而有舊人耶？」生以東兒自謂也，乃謝曰：「焉肯忘卿。」東兒曰「妾何足言，彼薦秀者，其可忘乎？」生曰：「此玉勝之德也，銘心刻骨而已。」東兒曰：「既不忘，曷不一顧？」生曰：「來日即往矣。」　
　　時岑與貞歸，生又屬望於貞。不意玉勝亦知生之在家也，今以詩招之，且托秀促生必至：
　　一別流光已數年，相思日夜淚漣漣；
　　新愁寂寞非媛煩，往事淒涼卻恨天；
　　罟網新絲蛛尚織，梁巢泥墜燕還聯；
　　誰知蠻重風流客，不管離人在眼前。
　　生見詩，即往拜謁。
　　時副使在任所，惟妻小在家。而副使之繼事顏氏，名松媛，奉南熏氏，名驗紅，皆以淫蕩相尚。見生與玉勝會面時悲咽相對，情甚悽慘。乃謂勝曰：「令表兄何必流涕？少留於此，與汝常得相見，不亦樂乎」，勝喜，語生。生亦私喜，乃就寓於新翠軒。
　　近晚，一女童持玉環紫縧一事奉生，曰：「妾，南薰也。奉南熏娘命，約君一敘。」生以親故，不敢承命。南薰以縧作同心結，乃辭而去。既而，又一婢女至，捧紫綾絹綴金剔牙贈生，曰：「妾，南熏主之愛妾驗紅，托為致意，君勿驚訝。」生曰：「適松娘有命，金錢曰「君今先往松娘，會後辭以避嫌，以就外宿。妾與驗紅會於此。」生如其言，登時潛入內寢。松娘已具酒飯於別室，邀生溫存，雜謔浪，至夜分方就枕。生恐驗紅久待，力辭就外，松娘曰：「一家以妾為主，何避之有？」著意留之，至雞鳴時始得脫身生回寓，則驗紅已就內矣，惟金錢倦睡生榻，生問：「驗紅何在所「久待不至，倦而返矣。」生悵然若有所失。然餘興未盡，抱金錢倦而含睡，解衣而貼席，任生所為。生乘其弱態，縱意眼作嬌媚聲，唧唧若蕭管，半響乃平，復謂生曰：「驗紅其即去有女，年十七，名曉雲，君何不圖之？」生銘其等。」　
　　時驗紅不遂所欲，乃寄一詞以招之，名《隔浦蓮》：
　　「紅蘭相映翠葆，郎在香閨窈，雲重遮嬌月，巢深怨棲鳥睡蝶迷幽草，頻相告。鴛鴨同池沼，郎年少。通宵不起，何故恁般顛倒？有約偏違幽興，獨捱清曉。今本望郎至，任他慇懃，即須撇了。」　　
　　生得詞，至晚會驗紅於外寓。松娘使人招生，生不至，知為驗紅所邀自度色衰，不能勝紅，乃集侍女南薰等十人，佩以蘭麝，飾以珠玉，衣以錦繡，加以脂粉，宛然如花，縱欲縱淫，惟求快己。生沐其厚惠，欲其歡心，雖眾婢同寢，而松娘必行徇其私，及松事罷，而從婢方共縱其欲。生於斯時不喪魂而為槁魄也，亦幸矣。
　　驗紅知生不能挽回，謀於金錢。錢曰：「曉雲雖處子，頗諳情趣，妾當以春心挑之，倘事諧，則母子爭春，情自釋矣。」紅曰：「善。」令金錢以計挑之。曉雲每夜半窺其母之所為，亦頗動心，及紅之挑，但含笑而已。
　　一日，曉雲書一詩於几。紅得之，喜曰：「計在此矣。」　　
　　無端春色亂芳心，恍惚風流入夢深。
　　淚漬枕邊魂欲斷，倩誰扶我見知音？　　
　　曉雲學於玉勝，字跡頗相類。紅得雲之筆，即命金錢付生，促以成事生方與松娘對坐撫琴，金錢促步近生，若聽琴狀。適松娘起手，錢即以詩納生袖，且附耳曰「那人詩也。」言畢百去。生視詩，以為玉勝之作，正慮勝以他就為非，每悒怏焉，又見詩，急赴勝處。
　　勝方午睡東興軒。生視左右無人，乃以手舉勝裙，徐徐起其股跪而就之。勝驚醒，見生，歎曰：「兄已棄妾矣，何幸回心一顧耶？」生謝曰：「此心惟天可表，豈敢棄卿，但為春色相羈，不容自措耳。」勝曰：「春色相羈，今何生得至此？」生曰：「思卿久矣。適卿又賜佳章，如不勝身一會，罪將何贖？」生且言且狎，勝有卻生狀。生一手為勝解裙，且勸曰：「姑敘舊耳，何相責之甚耶？」勝乃笑而從之。既而，問生曰：「妾有何章？」生以詩示之。勝曰：「此曉雲筆也。雲有此作，欲自獻矣，但母之愛女，兄謹避之。」言未畢，金錢笑至，附生耳曰：「那人被驗紅留住久矣，可急往。」　
　　生別勝往見紅，即索云。紅戲曰：「先謝媒，方許見。」生自指心，曰：「以此相謝，何如？」紅即挽生入後軒。雲果對鏡獨坐，見生至，低首有羞態。紅乃攜雲手附生。生執其手，溫軟玉潔，狂喜不能自制，乃與紅、雲同就寢所。生為雲解衣，而紅亦自脫繡，三人並枕。及生之著雲也，雲年少不能勝，齧齒作疼痛聲狀。紅憐雲苦，乃捧生過，以身就之；見雲意少安，生興少緩，則又推生附雲，欲生之畢事於雲也，及雲力不能支，則紅又自納矣。代雲之難而紅便，一枕悲歡，或紅而或云，而岐風月。豈料松娘俟生不至，知在紅所，處往招之。出外門，及寢所，寂天人跡。進入小軒，見生方窘雲，而紅替興於側，不覺天理復萌，怒形於色，然所愛在女，而所惜在生，惟與紅相戾而已。紅恃素寵不懼，挽松娘袖，罵曰：「上不正，則下亂！汝欲何為？」松娘怒，以手披紅面。生與雲跪泣，力勸不能止，乃為玉勝夫竹豪所知。豪，放蕩士也，怒生亂其妹，欲謀殺生。
　　生方愧罪，避宿後園。豪使人俟生就寢，暗鎖其戶，夜深人靜，欲舉火焚之。玉勝知其謀，料豪不可勸，乃捐金十兩，私托鎖戶者放生出，仍鎖戶以待火。夜深火發，救者咸至，豪以為生必死，而不知生之預逃也。
　　生乘夜渡河，次日至午，方抵廉宅。廉方會客，賞牡丹。生至，客皆拱手曰：「久慕才名，方得瞻仰。」生遜謝就坐。酒半酣，客揖廉曰：「名花滿庭，才子在坐，欲煩一詠，尊意何如？」廉目生就命。生乃操筆直書，杯酒未乾，詩已脫稿：
　　「爛縵花前酒興起，詩魂拍入花叢裡。露洗珊瑚錦作堆，風薰蝴蝶衣沾。平章宅裡說姚黃，沉香亭北呼魏紫。淡妝濃襯豈相同，朵朵繡出胭脂紅。更有一枝白於面，恍似倚欄長歎容。春光有限只九十，莫把芳心束萬重。名葩種種皆難得，十家根固千年澤。揮灑漸無草聖工，推敲便有花神力，興高何用食萬鍾，詩富不愁無千石。且歌且舞拂芳塵，海嶠霞鋪錦繡茵，輕翠簇妝揮解語，點首東風欲咫尺。萬恨莫辭金穀酒，一樽且近玉樓春，春光莫別花皇去，花皇且挽春光住。日日花前酒滿杯，滿杯春色花催句。詩酒春花同百年，何用浮生悲未遇。」
　　眾客視畢，撫掌歎賞。有一老長於詩者，贊曰：「此四聲各六句體也，詩家最難，長庚之後，絕無此作。祁君一揮而就，豈非今之李白乎？」皆舉杯稱羨，盡醉而罷。
　　廉持詩入，示岑曰：「子車酋真天才也，他日必有大就。我欲欲溫嶠故事，將麗貞許之，可乎？」岑曰：「妾有此意久矣。」時文娥、小卿在側，一馳報生，一馳報貞。貞正念生，忽得此報，喜動顏色。生得報，狂不自禁。是夜廉以酒醉，與岑早寢。生乃潛入，以指叩貞戶。貞開戶見生，且驚且喜，各以父母意交賀。生因牽貞袖求合。貞曰「兄鄭重！待婚禮成，取洞房花燭之喜，不亦善乎？」生曰：「天從人願，事已決矣。況機不可失，尚相拒耶？」遂抱貞就枕。貞不能阻。六禮未行，先赴陽台之會；兩情久協，才伸錦幔之歡。春染絞綃，香傾肺腑；恍若鴛侶，何啻鸞鳳。誠仙府之奇逢，實人間之快事也。天明，生就外，貞以玉如意贈生。生曰：「卿欲我如意耶？」一笑而別。生喜，作一詞以自道云：
　　「佳期私許暗敲門，待黃昏，已黃昏。喜得無人，悄入洞房深。桃臉自羞心自愛，漏聲遠，入羅幃，解繡裙。」　
　　枕邊枕邊好溫存，被已溫，釵已橫。愛也愛也，聲不穩，尤自慇懃。惟有窗前，明月露新痕。近照怕及花憔悴，花損也，比前番，消幾分？」（《江城梅花引》）　　
　　自是早出晚入，極盡繾綣。舉家皆知。所未知者，廉夫婦也。
　　光陰迅倏，又及試期。生辭廉夫婦及秀、貞赴科。貞私贈甚厚，不可悉記，惟錄一詞，名曰《陽關引》：
　　「才綰同心結，又為功名別。一聲去也，愁千結，也如割。願月中丹桂，早被郎攀折。莫學前科，誤盡了良時節。----記取枕邊情，衾上血。定成秦晉同偕老，歡如昔。最苦征鞍發，從此相思急。安得魂隨去，處處伴郎歇。」
　　生途中惟以貞為念，至旅邸，鬱鬱不寧，寢食皆廢，作樂府一首，名曰：《長相思》：
　　「長相思，心不絕，思到相思心欲裂。羅幃素月清不寐，淚如懸河積成血。----山可崩，海可竭，人生不可轉離別。別時容易見時難，長歎一回一嗚咽。」　　
　　時有同赴科者，名章台，寄居花柳間，生因訪之。章喜生至，拉一妓，名玉紅，伴生。生雖同枕，若無情者。明日，又換一妓曹媚兒，生亦如之。又明日，換一妓喬彩鳳，生亦如之。至於名妓馬文蓮、蘇晚翠、趙燕寵、陳秋雲、姚月仙，日易一人，輪奉枕席，生皆不以介意，惟以麗貞是念。然章台與生同席舍，欲利生之筆，必求一可生意者。至一院，眾妓方聚戲，內一妓張逸鴻笑曰：「昨晚妹子夢新解元是故人祁姓者。」生驚異，揖而問曰：「令妹為誰？」曰：「桂紅。」生求見，妓曰：「適一赴舉相公請去，今晚不回矣。」生乃就宿逸鴻以待之。明日，桂紅歸，即玉勝婢也。因紅與生私，怒而出之，媒利厚謝，私賣與妓家。至得，得與生會，悽慘不勝。既而，賀曰：「昨夢君為榜首。」生喜而謝之，是夕，與桂紅寢，幸得故人，少舒憂鬱，乃浩然吟一首云：
　　棲鶴樓中採嫩紅，百花叢裡又相逢。
　　姻緣想是前生定，故遣功名入夢中。
　　章台見生與紅款厚，以為生溺於紅，捐金百兩，娶紅以贈生。生知其意在代筆，遂拜而受之。三場後揭榜，生果第一，章亦在百名內。
　　時笙歌集門，賓客填坐，忽一家童秀郎者，忙奔報曰：「廉參軍事發，合家解京，危在旦夕，窘中有書持奉。」生為之驚倒，急開緘視書，曰：
　　「即殿元子車酋行台下，尚在官時，右丞相鐵木迭兒欲娶小女麗貞為婦，尚以彼蒙古人，不願從命，竟觸其怒，欲致尚以死，近贑州蔡九五作亂，豈以玉勝翁竹副使與彼同謀為不軌，破破汀州寧化。尚久廢棄，毫不與聞，今乃坐已知情，陷以同黨，蒙上合家拿問。尚為權要所仇，分在必死，但家小輩不知下落耳，幸足下高科，必膺顯擢。次女麗貞，願操箕帚，其餘乞念骨肉至情，一體照亮，九泉之下，必拱手叩謝也，身罹國法，鎖禁甚嚴，情緒萬千，筆不能盡，再拜。」　　
　　生視書，每讀一句，則長歎一聲，淚下如雨，即持書入示桂紅。紅亦捶胸哭曰：「流落煙花，得君留戀，自喜故鄉可歸，相見有日，何不幸復遭此耶？」遂促生早上春官，以探消息，且曰：「妾隨去，與小姐輩一面足矣。」豈生以榜首各事所繫，淹留月餘，才得就路。
　　及至京，廉與竹氏父子皆以謀逆棄市矣。兩家女子麗貞、毓秀、曉雲，皆沒入宮為婢。其餘家小，各流三千里。生得信仆地，氣絕而蘇者數次。桂紅再三慰解，生終不能已，乃設醴牲、作文遙奠廉於逆旅。時延　二年冬十二月初三日也。
　　「嗚呼！以翁之德，宜受多福；以翁之賢，宜享厚祿。胡為乎位止參軍，胡為乎老見屠戮？嗚呼！」蒼天既無酬賢報德之私，乃有林木池魚之酷。每寄翁書，托其家屬。今二女入宮，餘丁竄北，歎箕帚之無緣，痛貞、秀之難贖。雲散長空，月沉西陸；春歸掖庭，雪消阡陌。嗚呼！翁真千古之冤，豈止一人之獄！翁視內親，情由骨肉；今翁已矣，不可復續。聊舉清樽，遙陳衷曲。嗚呼痛哉！姪不能挽天以雪冤，寧不臨風而長哭！」　　
　　祭畢，生愁苦無以自慰，遣秀郎訪問兩家寄跡之地。店主皆曰：「入宮者入宮，流散者流散。只有一白面女子，身俊而雅，眉秀而長，香肩半勻，金蓮甚窄，臨入宮時留一緘，祝曰：「新科祁解元來京，即與之。」生知為麗貞緘也，急遣秀郎以謝意索緘。生得緘開視，乃一詩也：
　　八幅湘裙染血紅，母流父死欲消魂；
　　故人牽記鴛鴦夢，位顯須開控訴門；
　　自歎有天難共戴，應知無地再通恩；
　　君心若似初相識，憐取蛾眉見至尊。
　　果麗貞筆也，托生復仇。生得詩，痛入脊骨，魂不附體。每月白風清，浩然長歎，觸景題情，無非念貞意也。有和貞韻一律，極盡哀慕之苦：
　　淋漓衫袖血啼痕，不見多情幾斷魂；
　　冷月笑人多伏枕，飛云為我渡長門；
　　深仇可復寧辭力，偕老無緣竟絕恩；
　　含淚羞消如意玉，倩誰傳語赭袍尊？　　
　　玉如意，貞所贈也，生睹物思人，手不能釋。每歎曰：「麗貞，吾掌上珠也，今安在哉！」　
　　時京師知生未娶，欲婚之者多，生皆不應。桂紅勸曰：「君取高科，豈有無妻之理？麗貞已入宮，無再會之期。他日仕途中議君溺於妓妾，不復婚娶，豈不重有玷乎？」生隱几垂淚，默然不言。紅又諫曰：「君以萬金之軀，乃耽無益之苦，事出無奈，可別求佳偶，何佇意於難得之人耶？」生惟長歎不答。紅因出汗巾為生拭淚，委曲勸之。生喟然歎曰：「天下女子，豈有麗貞者哉？」紅曰：「麗貞固不易得，但多訪之，或有勝於貞者，未可知也。君何絕天下之無人耶？」生曰：「京城女子，我決不從。昔山中讀書，感龔老之恩，以女道芳見許，後遇麗貞，遂失約。而道芳尚未受聘，不得已，其在此乎！」桂紅謝曰：「君可謂不忘舊矣。」即遣人歸，以禮聘道芳。龔老以舊盟，遂納焉，但復曰：「願祁郎自重。余相祁郎當作三元，但眉生二眉，花柳多情，此亦陰騭也。今已一元矣，後二元恐不可望。然連科危甲，位至三公，非世有者。幸以此言達之，以為他日之驗。」　
　　後生會試，名在第九。殿試擬居狀元，但策中一段，頗礙權要：
　　「挾宮恩而居輔弼，半朝廷之官以為己隨；酷刑法而肆貪婪，傾國家之財以為己出。山移日食，地震土崩，良有以也。」
　　時鐵木迭兒以太後命為右丞，內外弄權，奸貪不法。見生策，大怒遂以霍希賢為狀元，而生乃探花也。將拜官，生辭不就命，願請面奏。上召入，問曰：「卿何為不俗官？」生奏曰：「臣家素守清白，世受國恩，黃門待制，刺史稽勛，各有功績，著在簡端。獨臣父為蕭氏所陷，致使無辜。臣聞殺人之父，人亦殺其父。今臣既有不共之仇，又與冠裳之列，豈不上有忝於朝廷，下有忝於祖宗，中有負於所學？臣尚未娶，願陛下念臣，一雪此冤，臣不惟不願受官，亦願終身不娶。」上聞之惻然，令待御史往案其事。觀音保知生微時已欲復仇，今不可挽矣，蕭求於鐵木迭兒，不能救，父子逐相繼而死。
　　自是，金園，琴娘為眾所欺，家日凌替，田產屋宇，消沒殆盡，金園寄食於母家；琴娘遂為鐵木迭兒所得，甚愛之，時趙子昂以詩畫動。天下，鐵木迭兒每見子昂垂顧，必使琴娘捧硯，乞子昂之筆，子昂每呼為「玉硯兒」，鐵木迭兒因贈焉，且曰：「長使為君掌硯。」子昂笑曰：「君子不奪人之所好。」鐵木迭兒曰：「君之筆，予所好也。以予之所好易君之所好，何不可者？」子昂因畫五馬飲溪圖以謝之。又嘗呼琴娘為「五馬兒」，蓋以五馬圖所易也。
　　及祁生拜翰林修撰，為子昂同僚。子昂每勸生娶，生曰：「家貧無以為禮。」子昂甚憐這，歎曰：「天使孝子受此窮獨耶？」一日，子昂留生飲，半醉，與生聯句，呼曰：「五馬兒捧硯來。」生心在詩，不暇他目，惟執筆而已。
　　「香鬱金樽綠似油，幾番沉醉曲城頭（祁）。香雲有態時時變（趙），野水無情處處流（祁）。好醜原來都是夢（趙），窮通常事不須愁（祁）。英雄自古多磨滅（趙），且向花前一醉游（祁）。」
　　琴娘時以眼視生。生忽見琴娘，遺詩不語。子昂曰：「君尚有所思乎？」生曰：「無。」子昂強之。生曰：「心事不敢言。」子昂曰：「如不言，罰以大觥。」使琴娘舉觥於生前。生欲言不言，徘徊間，琴娘不覺淚下。子昂疑，強問所以。生不能隱，遂告以實。子昂歎曰：「為蕭氏婢，亦有救人之心，可謂賢矣。然君之故人，僕豈敢留？」即令肩輿送至生第。生感其恩，作詞以謝昂焉：
　　玉堂風伯，醉後風流佳句得。忽見嬌姿，淚眼淒涼捧玉卮。
　　可憐病客，錦帳鴛鴦猶未結。重感瑤琴，不贈豪家只贈貧。
　　（名《減字木蘭花》）　　
　　生見琴娘，問：「金園何在？」琴曰：「已還母家矣。」生歎息久之。
　　時蔡九五作亂，上命浙江樞密使張驢討之。鐵木迭兒惡生，累薦生為監軍使。生與張揮旌策馬，直抵賊壘，三戰三捷之，賊眾潰散。生因經略賊營，收其輜重及所擄婦女三千，各審其籍貫，放還。是夜，生喜功成，飲酒數斗，擊劍而歌曰：
　　「一擊劍兮定四方，星沉斗轉兮夜蒼蒼。辭翰墨兮陷鋒芒，功名奏凱兮殿天子之邦。安得美人兮共舉觴，見我一笑兮為我解征裳。」　
　　歌罷，見二軍攘至帳前，相毆流血。生究其故，因放所擄婦女皆有所索，及一婦，自稱宦家，且身無所有，軍以勢迫之，出一玉扇墜，二軍爭取，是以相毆。生見扇墜，歎曰：「此徐氏故物，乃我所贈金園者，何以至此？」即令追其婦。婦至，即金園也。金園歸母家，因賊至出逃，途中為賊所獲。生納之。
　　明日，生以捷書上聞，捷書中有一聯云：
　　「臣等衣暫試於一戎，月連飛於三捷。鯀罪已戮，見東海之無波；氛氣盡消，仰太陽之普照。」
　　捷書至，上方侍太後，太後捧捷書讀，歎曰：「軍中有此筆，必出才子之手。」因問承旨趙子昂，子昂曰：「此修撰祁羽狄筆也。此人自幼未娶，學識高才，且為復仇，孝行可加。今為監軍使。」太後曰：「求忠臣於孝子之門。此人既孝，則事君必忠，一戰破賊，乃其小試耳。然而至今未娶，何也？」子昂曰：「家貧無以為禮，是以未娶。」太後與上歎曰：「使臣子貧而無妻，皆朕之罪。待班師，朕給以寶鈔，再賜宮人四員，事彼歸娶，以彰朕厚賞之恩。」遂即降旨班師。
　　生至京，得聞上意，密謀於宦官續元暉曰：「上欲賜臣宮女四人，臣，吳中人也，有新入宮者，亦吳人，廉氏名麗貞，乞查訪，得賜，當效犬馬。」暉曰：「鄙人有梅竹圖，得君佳句，即效力如命。」生即題曰：
　　漏泄春光有此花，凍雷驚動亦萌芽；
　　九天雨露冰姿瑩，咫尺雲霄鳳尾斜；
　　青鎖曉臨聞禁笛，紫宸朝罷玉衝牙；
　　高堂清逸懸圖處，不比尋常力士家。
　　元暉喜，即入宮。及出，見生曰：「宮人十餘，不能盡齒頰，將安得耶？」生不言久之。繼而喜曰：「我有玉如意，乃此人舊物，君持入宮，彼或見此，必自訴也。」元暉持而復入。過一側殿，果一宮人見而問曰：「此物何來？」暉曰：「此吾友所贈也。卿何相問？」宮人曰：「友為誰？」暉曰：「祁修撰也。」曰：「非羽狄乎？」曰：「然。」宮人問未完，即流淚。暉曰：「卿非廉氏麗貞否？」貞驚曰：「君何識妾名？」暉告其故，貞大喜，即與毓秀、曉雲共以金贈暉，皆求賜出，旁一宮人，亦關中女也，知貞等謀，亦願出金求賜，暉並許之，及生見上，上果賜焉。
　　生受賜，謝恩還第，惟以得貞為念，不意秀與雲皆與焉。相見，抱頭號哭，悲淚交集。貞、秀與雲收淚相拜謝。其一女尚掩面嗚咽，生怪而問這，乃陸嬌元也，自為舟人所逼，即欲赴水，舟人惡之，賣與一富家，富家有女該宮人，其母不忍，乃匿其女，而出元代焉。元自湖口別生，經歷萬苦，不意復得見生，是以慘甚。生再三撫慰，同載而還。
　　錦纜牽風，開檣漫水。白雲江上，咿咿一棹笙歌：碧樹灘邊，泐泐半帆山色。心懸離合，情集悲歡。生命鉤簾設宴，言笑怡然。酒半酣，生撫麗貞肩，歎曰：「我與卿不意今日有此會也。」貞曰：「吾入宮時留詩奉君，已有『無地通恩』之歎，今幸合為一家，昔日之盟庶不負矣。」生曰：「僕和卿韻亦有『偕老無緣竟絕恩』之句。今事出於無心，而夙願已從。則少年時遇玉仙子賜詩一律雲『相逢玉鏡台，』蓋與卿等會也；又云『天朝賜妙才』，蓋今日上之賜以卿也。其言驗矣，吾與卿等焚香拜空以謝之。」及眾拜起，見雙鶴繞舟，半響而去。生喜，即命酌酒，琴娘起舞，桂紅雅歌，毓秀點板，金園吹簫，曉雲撥箏，嬌元捧壺，麗貞執爵，共勸之曰：「今日之樂，亦非尋常，願君酩酊。」生曰：「誠奇會也，固當一醉。但無詩不可以記勝，予為首倡，卿等繼之。」　　
　　「把酒歡良會，猶疑夢寐中（生）。姻緣天已定（雲），離合散還同（貞）。歷難投金闕（元），留恩免劍峰（園）。狂雷中露發（季），深院隔牆逢（紅）。梅老鶯初壯（貞），衾寒日已東（琴）。玉堂金掛綠（生），粉臉昔題紅（貞）。痛母心千里（秀），私恩拜九重（雲）。何方吳與越（琴），誰料始能終（元）。歌舞慚多辱（紅），興衰覺亂衷（園）。大家須一醉，何必訴窮通？」　　
　　生曰：「琴娘之『吳越』、金園之『興衰』，尚有恨耶？」琴、園謝以無心，各舉爵奉生。生飲之，不覺沉醉。乃即舟中設枕大被，眾女解衣擁生而寢。生眷戀之情，人各及焉。
　　明早，過陳夫人宅，生登涯訪之。陳甚喜，令孔姬出見，視生微笑，各理舊情。不意陳族中及外人皆知之，生乃避嫌還舟中。時差人饋答往為，凡三日，道姑宗淨等知之，恨生不至，且與陳因生結仇，絕不往來，難以就陳見生，惟與眾道姑悵恨而已。
　　時有道士劉志先，乃蔡九五黨也，有妖術，因蔡敗逃匿院中。宗淨素知劉有術，請計於劉。劉曰：「不難，夜即誅陳。」眾不之信。是夜，祁生以絞綃帕寄詩於陳，陳方坐燈下讀詩，因呼孔姬，語曰：「祁君以此見寄，請亦切矣，奈不可近何！」　
　　數載相思窈窕娘，臨風幾欲斷愁腸。
　　而今久泊孤舟待，咫尺無緣到枕旁。
　　孔姬未及答，忽戶外有兵戈聲。方欲趨避，忽然見一人長丈餘，手持雙斧，身披甲冑，髮赤面青，形狀甚怪，向前喝曰：「誰為陳也？」陳疑其盜，跪而告曰：「妾，陳氏也，將軍用寶，任將軍取之。」其人曰：「奉劉元帥令，取汝首級，焉用寶為。」言罷，斬陳首懸腰馳去。
　　孔姬合家驚倒仆地，不知所以。至晚乃蘇，率婢輩同奔生舟，告以故，以遂匿焉。即令人訪陳氏事。首級血流一路，直至院中。生知陳與院中不和，必為道姑所謀，托官府追究。各道姑懼禍，皆指劉。劉知不可脫，遂擁眾作亂，殺傷官兵，不可勝計。
　　官府以變聞。上遣樞密使院判官章台督兵捕之。章即生之同科友也，將與劉戰，請計於生。生曰：「此人久處道院中，道姑必知其術，可先擒之。」章台令甲士擒宗淨等數十餘人。章究其術，眾云：「不知。」及加以酷刑，惟叩頭流血，毫無所言。生往救之，宗淨等已付軍法，惟涵師與錫未受刃，急令止之。生曰：「願代君討賊，以贖二人之命。」章曰：「君能破賊，何惜二奴。」即令涵師與錫還俗歸生。
　　生從容問錫曰：「此賊在院所為何事？」錫曰：「無他事，惟剪紙作戲具耳。」生曰：「戲具何狀？」曰：「其狀如甲冑之士。」孔姬在旁應曰：「殺陳者，即甲冑士也。」生即入軍中，令曰：「人各持狗血一升，賊至，先以血衝之。」生乃自束戎裝，以仙女所贈玉簪插於冠頂，且祝曰：「玉香仙子曾云簪能解厄，今與賊戰，宜衛我矣。」祝罷，即搗賊營，賊望生頂紅光貫天，威風刮地，不覺失聲而潰。生令軍中二中以狗血，賊皆仆地。生就視之，皆紙人也。生命以火焚之，劉志先乃伏誅。殘黨七十餘人，前舟人謀生者亦在內，生並斬之，遂與章別，發舟南還。章台崇酒於樽，作詞以送之：
　　「千里故人，一樽席上，笑口同開。念五六年前，三千士內，隨君驥尾，得占名魁。君受皇恩，妙齡歸娶，一棹笙歌碧水隈。青霄立，見中天奎壁，光動三台。-------如君海內奇才，七步風流氣似雷。況韜略兼全，兩番滅賊，他年麟閣，預卜仙階。沙燕留人，潭花送客，把手高歌一快哉。蒼生望，願早攜鴛侶，共駕回來。」
　　時生歸娶，妾媵女十餘人矣。及道芳入門，恭敬自持，麗貞等甚畏之，而奴輩不敢亂步。此亦大家之風範，才子之家箴也。生憶溜兒在獄，令人齎書至嬌元母家，其父即以書告官，言「女在，與溜兒無干。」溜兒歸，生以琴娘配之。
　　生娶畢還京，恨鐵木迭兒之肆惡，糾同內外監察御史四十餘人，劾其「逞私蠹國、難居師保之任」。上不聽。鐵木迭兒遂謀陷生，因出生為邊方經略使。生即戎服跨馬，以肅清邊為己任。臨行，吟詩以自誓云：
　　三尺龍泉吐赤光，英雄千載要流芳。
　　長驅直搗單于窟，烈烈轟轟做一場。
　　生到任點軍，殘缺死者甚眾。生查其妻小遺孤，編為一冊。冊內有一人與生同里閭者，觀其名，即陸用也。用以狡詐主母至死，遂問軍。生以軍令取用，時用以陣亡，其妻山茶入見。生問曰：「汝夫既死，隻身何托？」山茶叩首告曰：「幸吳妙娘夫亦以販賣官鹽，問軍到此，今其夫亦戰死矣，而妙娘尚有私蓄，是以相依在此，苟全性命。」生曰：「妙娘湖上之恩，乃我再生之主也。」即令入見。時分雖尊卑，而情同離合，會晤之頃，不覺淚下。生問妙娘：「歸否？」妙娘泣曰：「恨無路耳。」生乃匿以為妾；山茶則以秀郎配之，將名概除之，以絕查究。妙娘曰：「妾少為情客妻，壯為軍人婦，年逾三十流落於此，幸君帶歸，不死足矣，敢亻替衾枕耶？」生曰：「吾為重臣，美妾如簇，非愛卿色也。第卿乃始交之人，又有湖上之惠，豈為薄倖郎，身貴便忘賤耶？」是夜，挽妙娘同寢，喜甚，作《重疊金》詞：
　　少年一枕吳歌夢，春光怕泄驚相送。許久憶芳容，相逢湖水中。贈金知惠重，銘刻心嘗頌。今日是天緣，難將貴賤言。」
　　生既得妙娘，即起馬巡邊，梯山航水，自北而南，名震蠻夷，威如雷電。一日，過廉、竹所流之地。廉夫人岑氏、竹夫人松娘已疾故矣，所存者，玉勝、驗紅及各婢耳。見生至，皆放聲號哭，生亦惻然。玉勝揮淚問曰：「聞二妹、曉雲皆得侍左右，妾等不知生死，君寧忍耶？」生曰：「卿等暫止此。待還朝，當為卿復仇。卿等與貞、秀會有期矣。」勝等拜謝，祝曰：「此地非人所居，況無男子相衛，早一日歸，乃一日之惠也。」　
　　生自是邊功名重天下。上頗知賢異，擢生為招文館大學士兼平章軍國中書左丞相。後以英宗被弒、迎立晉王功，進開府儀同三司、上柱國、太師。鐵木迭兒為太子太師，生乃劾其「誣殺忠良，奸貪不道，至陷廉、竹家小。」自是，玉勝、驗紅並兩家婢妾，皆從生矣。鐵木迭兒恨生，使其歡為御史者，亦劾生「享大爵而以事夷君為恥，詐巡邊而以故軍婦為妾」，蓋指吳妙娘也。上不聽。生喜，歸語道芳。道芳曰：「功名富貴，皆有定數，人亦何為！」時麗貞侍側，從容進曰：「妾聞勇略震主者身危，功蓋天下者不賞，君之謂也。君見欹器乎？滿則覆。今君滿矣，願急流勇退，保攝天和，行歌花鳥，坐擁琴棋，不亦樂乎？」生聞之，豁然大悟，乃抱麗貞置之膝，兩臉相親，豁然歎曰：「久沉宦海，得卿提醒。大丈夫棄功名如敝屣，視富貴如浮雲，安用擔驚受恐、拖朱紫為傀儡態耶？」懇乞天恩，為求致仕，賦詩《浩然》而歸：
　　浩然長笑一臨風，解帶於今脫鳥籠。
　　此去溪山訪明月，不來朝陛拜重瞳。
　　詩書事業原無底，將相功勞總是空。
　　塵外逍遙真樂地，早攜仙侶醉花叢。
　　生歸，又娶美姬二人，曰碧梧、曰翠竹，及麗貞、玉勝、曉雲等共十二人，號曰「香台十二釵」。婢輩山茶、桂紅等及新進者僅百餘人，號曰：「錦繡百花屏」，　環之聲，聞於市井，麝蘭之氣，達於街衢。生每夜暮，皓齒輕歌，細腰雙舞，笙歌雜作，珍饈若山，紅粉朱顏，環侍左右，雖南面之樂，不過是也。宅後設一圃，大可二百畝，疊石為山，器籬為逕，峻亭廣屋，飛閣相連，異木奇花，顏色相照，四景長春，萬態畢集。生得游，必命侍妾捧筆硯，每至一處，必加題詠。然亦不能悉記，而吳中傳聞者，止二三詞而已。
　　《題繡谷堂》---（詞名《臨江仙》）　
　　「簾捲華常名繡谷，高山翠列如屏。四圍風送　環聲。奇花千萬種，松林兩三層。----山外有山山外水，水邊山頂皆亭。綠陰斜徑小橋橫。眼前堆錦繡，何處問蓬瀛？」　　
　　《題筠溪軒》---（詞名《浣溪沙》　
　　香銷籬黃金地棠，風生水榭竹陰涼。小窗飛影印池塘。
　　浪潑春雷魚欲化，竹圍山逕鳳來翔。署天水簟即瀟湘。
　　《題曲水流觴》---（詞名《天仙子》）　
　　「春曉轆轤飛勝概，曲曲清流塵不礙。玉龍昨夜臥松陰，雲自蓋，山自載，偃仰屈伸常自在。----浮觴要把蘭亭賽，別是人間閒世界。恍如仙女渡銀河，溪雖隘，行偏快，只用光生長坐待。」
　　園內鑿池，近百餘畝，內設六島，每島皆有樓、台、亭、榭，其制各異，石橋相連，下可舟楫，謂之「西池六院」一院則使二妾居之，二妾則以六婢事之。每院笙歌，晝夜不絕。
　　一夕月夜，生與道芳駕小舟遍遊池島，命各院八窗洞開，垂簾明燭，簫鼓低奏。清風徐來，水月相蕩，時執棹者吳妙娘也，生命為吳歌，隨波宛轉，聲若洞簫。各院皆以清笛應之，儼如鶴唳松稍，不覺塵骨皆爽。生樂甚，命酌酒，與道芳對飲。因舉手托道芳腮，戲曰：「今夜夫人興動矣。」道芳正色應曰：「夫妻相敬如賓，何戲狎如此！」生曰：「夫人乃鐵石人耶？」舟過一院，匾曰：「碧香瓊館」，貞與雲所居也。生因以手招貞，貞與雲登舟。生曰：「才得罪夫人，二卿為我謝之。」貞舉爵勸道芳，芳卻之。貞跪下，芳急扶起，曰：「貞姐自重，即當強飲。」繼而，曉雲亦舉酒跪奉。芳亦扶起。謝曰：「量不能矣。」生笑曰：「量頗容人，乃不能容酒耶？」芳又強飲之。西南一院隔欄遙呼曰：「妾未嘗見夫人飲，願下執壺。」生視之，乃玉勝、金園也。令取小舟渡至。亦各捧酒奉道芳，芳力辭。玉勝、金園勸曰：「妾等樗材，恩承　木，久涵飲德之恩，恨無涓滴之報。今借花獻佛，望夫人少飲。」生亦勸曰：「來意至誠，亦當少盡。」道芳乃啜其半。復強飲之，不覺香肌醉軟，睡態漸增。生命臥榻設重茵繡枕，扶道芳寢。乃與麗貞推篷坐月中，飛觴浪飲，縱棹遍遊各院，笙歌愈覺嘹亮。生曰：「與卿等聯句可乎？」眾曰：「可。」
　　「筵開畫舫夜初長（生），絕勝當年醉白堂（園）。水底明河斜轉影（勝），雲連新月細生光（貞）。詩盟不就君須罰（雲），………」
　　生抱雲戲曰：「卿今夜欲罰我乎？尚記得牀後小軒不能禁否？」雲笑曰：「此為驗紅所誘耳。」生以手插入雲懷，摩弄其乳，春興勃然，欲狎雲於坐中。雲曰：「夫人在坐，願公少待。」生曰：「汝畏夫人乎？我當先狎夫人。」乃舍雲而就榻，將欲解道芳衣；生醉後性急，忽動道芳佩玉一聲，道芳驚醒。生抱而戲曰：「如此良夜，適興何妨。」道芳起坐，曰：「侍妾滿前，明月照目，不意海內名公、朝廷重宰，乃兒戲一至此耶？」生不答，惟求相合。道芳怒起，拂衣登岸。貞等勸生曰：「夫人性重，欲與聚首，在妾院中可也。」生曰：「然。」率貞等邀道芳同宿，使眾妾即環侍左右。明日生酒醒，但見玉人如砌，香霧衝簾，生心蕩然，恣意縱欲。芳諫曰：「公非少年矣，願當自惜。」生笑曰：「老當益壯，何惜之有？」　
　　自是，淫樂無所不至，或吟詠，或局戲，有清談，皆與眾妾在焉。一日，月上忘歸，嘗有詩云：
　　共榻清談花霧濃，並頭聯句月明中。
　　起來一笑同攜手，繡谷堂深燭已紅。
　　或宿一院，則各院送茶，婢輩皆待生睡，方敢散歸。或生少出，則各院或明燭待之，香薰翠被，任生擇寢。或生浴，則眾妾環侍如肉屏。或天寒，必三妾共幔。生之家事，各有所司，生不自與，惟吟風弄月、逍遙池島而已。
　　一夕中秋，月明如晝，生方與眾妾泛舟，忽見西南祥雲聚起，鸞鶴旋飛，空中隱隱如有鼓吹。頃間，紅光照水，香氣逼人。生與芳等視之，見一女子立涯上，呼曰：「祁君，妾復來矣。」生停舟相接，乃玉香仙子也。玉香自袖中出丹一帖授生，且曰：「令家人一服之，皆可仙矣。況道芳乃織女星，貞乃王母次女也，餘皆蓬島仙姬，不必盡述。今欲緣已盡，皆當隨公上升。」言畢而去。
　　生自是飄逸有登天之志，絕欲服氣，還精固神，舉足能行空，出言可以驗禍福。人皆異之。後攜芳，貞等人終南山學道，遂不知所終云。
　　古杭紅梅記　
　　唐貞觀時，諫議大夫王瑞，字乾玉，乃骨鯁臣也，出為唐貞觀之任。有二子，長名鵬，次名鶚，皆隨焉。
　　鶚頗有素志，處州治中，紅梅閣下置學館讀書。閣前有紅梅株，香色殊異，結果實如彈，味佳美，真奇果也。郡守見而愛之結實時，守登成以數標記，防竊食者，留以供燕賞，饋送，筵之賓客是以紅梅畔門鎖不開，若遇燕賞，方得開門。
　　忽一朝，閣上有人倚欄，笑聲喧嘩。門吏回報，恐是宅眷又不聞聲音，遂立閣前看視，則封鎖不開。驚詫而回，急報之鎖看之，杳然無人。只見壁上有詩一首，墨跡未乾，詩曰：
　　南枝向暖北枝寒，一種春風有兩般。
　　憑倚高樓莫相顧，一家留取倚欄杆。
　　郡守見之，嗟歎良久，乃曰：「其詩清婉，無凡俗氣，此必神仙所題以青紗籠罩之。或遇宴賞，郡中士夫爭先快睹，皆稱盛事，因看之甚嚴。
　　忽一日設宴，王鶚與先生李浩然登閣。是時紅梅未有消息乃凴欄曰：「顧盼上詩，意清絕，是誰為之？然未有佳效。」浩然曰：「何也。」鄂曰：「我觀其首句『南枝向暖北枝寒』，今小春十月，安得南枝向暖狀貌也？」遂以手指紅梅而言之曰：「何不便開花，以實前詩。處，紅梅遂開，清氣襲人，瑩白奪目，頓覺身在仙境也。鶚驚而歎曰：「非為怪異，乃百花之魁也。」以詩贈鶚：
　　南北枝頭雪正凝，因君一指便霞蒸。
　　從知造化未逼爾，明歲巍科必首登。
　　王鶚告先生曰：「蒙賜佳章，斯望不淺，未敢續貂，伏惟請益云爾：「移植揚州久秘神，孤根一指便回春。姑仙應解尋芳意，先發南枝贈故人。」　
　　浩然歎曰：「覽此詩，前程未可量也。」久之，同下樓，秉燭，各回書院。
　　夜到半，鶚獨坐於書帷之中，焚香誦讀。鶚性孤潔，只留一小童相隨，不覺城樓更鼓已三鼓矣，將解衣就寢，忽聞有人聲，鶚曰：「是誰？」乃是一女子之聲，應曰：「妾乃門者之女，燈下刺繡鴛鴦宿蓮池，蓮池繡未完，鴛鴦繡未了，適值雨驟風顛，銀钅工吹滅，輒至書帷，告乞燈火，念奴至此已立多時，見君氣吐虹霓，胸蟠星斗，書聲越三唱之絲桐，咳唾傾囊中之珠玉，治唐虞而駕秦漢，師孔孟而友曾顏，奴亦樂道喜聞，不敢間斷君之書思也。候君就寢，乃敢叩窗，輒欲借燈，不阻乃幸。」王鶚聞其吐詞美麗清雅，頗有文士之風，疑非門者之女也。女子曰：「奴生長於斯，況前守於此置有學館，奴供酒掃，接見賢豪，剽竊詞章，暗閱經史，日就月將，亦心通焉。食麝柏而香之美也，無足怪焉。」王鶚曰：「才學如此，想必能詩。」女子曰：「略曉平仄。」鶚曰：「請燈為題。」乃呈一詩云：
　　無情風雨撲銀钅工，乞火端來叩玉窗。
　　恨隔疏櫺一片紙，卻將鸞鳳不成雙。
　　詩畢，女子復吟一絕，以答王鶚云：
　　聞君未覿意何濃，才子佳人不易逢。
　　只為乞燈當午夜，便勞宋玉詠高峰。
　　王鶚聞之，神思淫蕩。見女子有憐才之心，而鶚有願得之意。但恨窗前阻隔，莫盡衷腸，遂作一詩以見其意云：
　　驀聞詩句最鍾情，便欲尋芳與結盟。
　　可奈書窗燈影隔，惜花空自夢瑤英。
　　女子曰：「君既有惜花芳心，何為教人獨立於窗外乎？」乃吟一詩云：
　　獨立更深體覺寒，隔窗詩和見尤難。
　　合歡既肯將花惜，對面何如冷眼看？　　
　　王鶚高舉手，持燈於窗隙之間照之。見女玉容媚雪，花貌生春，衣雲袖飄飄，頂霞冠而爍爍，神仙之豔質，絕代之佳人也。王鶚曰：「人耶？鬼耶？故來相戲爾。吾乃朝臣子弟，廊廟才人，恪守不談鄙陋之言，佩服不私暗室之語。一失土行，萬瓦俱裂，名教之罪人也。適來賦詩這根源，非汝借燈，特是戲謔之言，原非本情。我心如石，不可轉也，淫戲非所願聞，汝宜速回，無貽後悔。」女子答曰：「奴亦非人非鬼，乃上界謫降仙子也，適為蓬萊上客，驂鸞輿而游三島，駕鶴馭以訪十州，經過蜀郡，乃於雲際聞君弦誦，特佇以聽；隔窗外而見郎神氣清爽，玉樹瓊枝，骨格孤高，原非塵埃中人。妾為宿緣仙契，固非偶然，願奉箕帚之下塵，以和鸞鳳之仙侶，爾亦如弄玉之於簫史，瓊姬之於子高，上元夫人之慕封秀士也。妾言已出，君且勿疑。」王鶚曰：「此非仙侶之言也。我聞神仙居溟漠之洞，處無虛之鄉，登太極之門，住蓬萊之島，同天地之壽，餐日月之光，世界破壞，此身不毀。吾今見汝以絲帛之服飾身，以淫亂之言惑人，色念不消，花心猶在，何得為神仙乎？」女子答曰：「君言非道理之言也。妾聞天地之大，豈偶然哉！日月交光，陰陽相游，上至天仙眷屬，不異人寰，下至草木昆蟲，豈無配偶？」嬰兒少女，存大道之玄機；乾覆坤載，作萬物之父母。而以獨陽不成，孤陰不生。郎是儒生，窮理多聞，廉恥四維，固不可不張，大道玄門，亦不可不度。妾雖仙侶，降謫凡世，與君夙契姻緣，今當際遇，布露再識，無用多疑，永夜良宵，敢告子識。」鶚曰：「既是流品與鶚有緣，奈嚴君在堂，家法整肅，何況為人之子不告而娶非禮歟？」女曰：「禮固然也，男女之情，雖父母亦有不可間斷。郎與先生李浩然閣上之詩，則妾所願也。君指『首句誰為之，無有佳效，』妾領君言，故發南枝，滿春色於花間，寄芳心於言外。君寓意作詩以挑之曰『姑仙應解尋芳意，先發南枝贈故人』，妾本仙質上品，南宮仙屬，我見君詩，已見先有情矣。是時妾在閣上，為先生李浩然在傍，不敢求見。今夕私逼，豈偶然哉？君如肯點頭領妾之意，妾意降志以侍君子，妾有大藥，可駐君顏；妾有大道，可贈君壽。同日與君入蓬萊，居長生館，坐龍車而游三島，駕鶴馭以訪十州，食王母千歲之桃，飲麻姑瓊液之酒，享物外逍遙之樂，結天下無盡之緣。過隙白駒，乃人間之光景；黃粱槐國，實昨夜之悲歡。生死輪回，立而可得。利祿如蠅頭蝸角，郎且勿貪；山家有鳳舞龍吟，君宜靜聽。比時取捨，可自裁之。」鶚曰：「天道甚遠，吾不能知。今日相逢，誓不及亂。鶚有素志，平生不敢犯慎獨之戒，且好德不好色也。」遂滅燈擁衾而坐。仙子推門，不得入，乃扣窗再囑曰：「君已無情見拒，奴亦暫且告別，他日再來。」抱恨而去。鶚通宵不寐，書窗漸明，方下榻而觀。案下有詩一絕云：
　　盡道多情反薄情，南枝空自歎芳英。
　　蕭生若有神仙骨，好共乘鸞駕玉京。
　　鶚只疑是妖魅，恐為所惑，不足介意。
　　次夜，又聞東閣有人歌紅梅曲者徐徐而來。細聽其聲，乃昨夜女子之聲。鶚遂滅燈就寢。其曲乃《減字木蘭花》也：
　　清香露吐，玉骨冰肌天賦。素質玲瓏，微抹胭脂一點紅。
　　迥然幽獨，不比人間凡草木。移種蓬山，解使傍人取次看。
　　曲罷，繼詩一絕雲　　
　　一謫人間已有年，暫拋仙侶結塵緣。
　　多情卻被無情惱，回首瀛洲意惘然。
　　詩罷，復來扣窗。王鶚不應。女子曰：「人非草木，特甚無情，一失機心，終身之恨。」俳徊窗下，往來歎嗟。又曰：「郎心匪石不移，妾意繁花撩亂，君非美玉之品，亦非封侯之徒。」怒罵而去。不覺雞聲報曉，樓閣初殘，則聽窗聲，杳然無跡。
　　鶚乃整衣下榻，又見案上一幅花箋，觀其字如鳳舞龍蟠，翰墨瀟酒。其詩曰：
　　誰道仙姬不嫁人，請看弄玉與雲英。
　　料君未有封侯骨，敢問君王乞與卿。
　　鶚見詩意謂昔雲英弄玉之事，又聞昨夜怒罵云「君非封侯之徒，」而欲求神仙配偶之意。「情思相感，昔已有人，今何不然？」乃思劉晨阮肇天台之游，慕陽台宋玉之事，獨行獨坐，如醉如癡。窗前絕弦誦之聲，梅下注相思之淚。焚香靜坐，遐想緬懷，欲一再睹仙子，不可得也。乃吟一絕以惆悵云：
　　當年錯拒意中人，此日相思枉效顰。
　　咫尺桃源迷去路，落花流水漫尋春。
　　又於紅梅閣下題一絕云：
　　南枝曾為我先開，一別音容回不來。
　　盡日相思魂夢斷，雨雲朝暮繞陽台。
　　又於閣上眺望，徒倚欄杆以吟風，笑詠桃花而臥月。
　　自此寢食日廢，念茲在茲，而先生李浩然知其王鶚染紅妖魅也，多方勸諭，勉之以詩云：
　　書中有女玉顏新，感事尋梅太損神。
　　恐有花妖偏媚眼，好呈彩服慰雙親。
　　王鶚終不聽，自此嗟歎悲泣，略無情緒。時繞梅邊，如有所待，或見怪異，致被父母懷疑於心，恐有他事，遂移王鶚寢於中堂，千金求醫，多方療冶。旬餘稍妥，飲食漸進，舉止如常。
　　忽一日，鶚又獨步紅梅閣下，惆悵不已。特見梅花自開，芳枝鬥豔，寒蟬噪於疏影，清風襲入暗香。忽憶壁上之詩，依前誦「南枝曾為我先開」之句，今物在人非，不覺淚下，遂望南枝別作一絕云：
　　風流業債告人難，女貌郎才好合歡。
　　今日花開人不見，幾迴腸斷淚闌干。
　　詩畢，又作《減字木蘭花》詞一闋云：
　　「素英初吐，無限游蜂來不去。別有春風，敢對群花間淺紅。憑誰遣興，寫句花箋全無定。白玉搔頭，淡碧霓裳人倚樓。」　　
　　作罷，見樹上有一幅花箋，遂用梅枝挑下。乃一詩云：
　　知君情夢慕淫芳，我亦思君懶下牀。
　　只恐臨軒人不顧，令人道是野鴛鴦。
　　王鶚看罷，詩意謂定今宵歡會，乃下閣復歸書院，喜不自勝，預設綺席，薰降真香，排列以候仙子之至。
　　遇夜，果來，鶚喜蕭敬迎之書帷中，敘間闊之情，分賓而坐。仙子笑謂鶚曰：「前日相拒，非君無情，今日相會，莫非良緣？」王鶚答曰：「恨無仙骨，多有夙愆，初時拂逆仙顏，深為冒犯。自愧沉淪業海，以致仙鳳迥隔，恐萬劫難逢。豈期再睹玉顏，從此再無相負。」仙子曰：「妾初瞻仰之時，知君素有仙方，偶會期願可諧，盡在天上人間。惟君神契，妾意是思。今睹憶念，果金石不移。味其詩詞，又心口相應。與子偕老，地久天長。」鶚再拜賦詩云：
　　敢將風質伴仙儔，同坐雲車玩十洲。
　　今日幸諧鸞鳳侶，桑田變海此生休。
　　仙子曰：「初見君顏，緣尚未偶，今日知君情意堅，確信是天緣，非人所能合也，妾最固辭哉！妾有仙家酒肴，長春美醞，千歲松醪，瑤池蟠桃，天苑仙果，玉麟白兔之脯，龍肝鳳髓之饈，願奉君前，惟情所願。」但將碧玉簪敲身上所繫佩玉數聲，俄有青衣二童子各持金卮玉　、嘉肴美饈，羅列於前。果非人世間所有之物，自是仙家異色品味也。鶚因問曰：「仙子名籍，屬何洞天？」仙子曰：「妾乃是南宮品仙也。每至三元日，降下凡間，隨意遊賞。見郎君精神爽異，才思孤高，契妾夙心，願諧仙侶。正謂在天願為比翼鳥，入地共成連理枝，每攜手以同行，長並肩而私語，天地有盡，此誓無窮。」遂解衣就寢。仙凡胥慶，始覺人間玉繩遄轉，銀漏急催，卻早城烏啼曉，扶桑雞唱，歡情未厭，離思復牽矣。
　　仙子晨興，急整霞帔，忙穿繡履，乃別鶚曰：「妾獲倚書幃之諧，素望後期未卜。」離情繾綣，不忍別去。許以七夕復會，遂以分袂，命駕雲車。行間，又謂鶚曰：「君欲知妾之名姓否？妾乃張氏，小字笑桃，籍在瓊樓，別有名號。君宜記之。」言訖出戶，望東北角騰空而去。
　　後至七夕之夜，王鶚瞻候，仙子果至。鶚笑而迎之。遂攜手而書幃，再敘舊歡。仙子言曰：「妾暫賦《式微》之章，君忽戀人間之喜，故來見辭。」鶚曰：「何棄我速乎？」仙子曰：「奴赴此期，恐負私約耳。若失大信，將何面目以見我仙侶乎？雖是暫別，何用增悲，既謝留別，難為割捨。妾欲與君同赴華胥之約，可乎？」鶚曰：「凡愚下質，夢不到於仙宮，既許同游，願尾車塵之後。」　
　　仙了遂以手攜王鶚之手，同行碧落之中。鶚神思恍惚，見侍從數人，體貌妍麗。忽見二隻白鶴從空而來，請仙子、王鶚乘之，向空而去。
　　至雲端，見瓊樓鶴繞，碧殿鸞翔，奇花開春，鳴禽和日，真仙之境也。俄有一青衣玉女來，迎入仙府。有命：「置宴於碧霞殿。茲者承勞仙眷遠來，筵中以添座位，用敢奉邀，幸望惠然。」鶚曰：「主人情重。」遂同往至碧霞殿。主席者，乃房杰仙子也，不施鉛粉，自有仙姿。主席者先為筆桃敘間闊之情，次及鶚。鶚曰：「鶚乃詩書寒儒，簪纓孺子，不期庸質，誤入洞天。既獲瞻承，曷勝榮幸！」主席者答曰：「妾姓房名杰，今日之會，喜遇佳賓，愧無倒履之迎，幸有投轄之飲。」又令左右青衣往玉英館請諸仙主座。須臾，仙女十數輩皆來，披霞佩露，絕質奇容，前揖主席，次與笑桃敘久別之懷。乃與王鶚相揖，排列而坐，開樽酬酢，酒已三行，主席者曰：「我輩前列仙品，各有仙局所拘，每以邂逅為期，豈料有此佳會。乃蒙君子不鄙而訪臨，決匪人為，實惟天幸。然所居之館名崇英，又有玉英之館，以眾仙女所居。各座仙女，名曰柳梅卿、宋梅莊、王蘭素、韓婉清、李渭瓊、凡梅英等。今日筵中之酒，其品有三：一曰透天醞，可駐人顏；二曰碧玉漿，令人智慧；三曰白梅香，令人增壽。今酒已三行，吾輩各舉前日閣上所題之詩，曰：『南枝向暖北枝寒，一種春風有兩般。憑枝高樓莫吹笛，大家留取倚欄杆。』」房杰曰：「果是出塵之句，實符今日之仙會也。杰最續貂。」乃和其韻：
　　朔風晴雨對嚴寒，南北枝頭總一般。
　　向暖讓人先去折，耐寒有令不須乾。
　　合座稱賞，曰：「杰舊日佳章，予不敢及。今日之詩，幸逢敵手，願和以示鶚。」云：
　　冰肌玉骨不知寒，酌酒探花態萬般。
　　吹徹風簫還起舞，參橫月落滿欄杆。
　　眾仙稱賀，才調清雅，一座盡吹，鶚已中酒，群仙姊妹俱起舞於前，慇懃相勸，鶚又強飲，乃至大醉，群仙曰：「華胥僻陋，謝君訪臨，此會千載一遇，願得佳章，用光此席。」鶚曰：「僕雖不才，唯命是從。」乃作詩一絕云：
　　喜隨鸞鶴會群仙，濟濟仙才盡出倫。
　　相慶佳期觴詠處，不知誰是惜花人？　　
　　仙女看詩，相顧而笑曰：「謝君佳作，甚有餘味。」酒已罷，乃隨眾仙登閣玩賞，見紅梅甚發，大勝於前。眾仙覓詩，鶚又賦云：
　　誤入華胥喜結盟，倚欄還欲賞梅英。
　　題詩聊索仙成美，誰道無情卻有情。
　　眾仙見詩，皆含笑相謝。惟笑桃改容，謂鶚曰：「何酒後把心不定，亂發狂言？」遂投筆硯於前。鶚曰：「詩本性情，誠酒後狂妄也。」諸仙勸笑桃，令鶚再作，以解其慍。鶚遂奉命，仍以紅梅為詠，寓前日持贈故人之意云：
　　玉骨冰肌別樣春，淡妝濃抹總宜真。
　　個中誰辯通仙句，折取南枝贈故人。
　　笑桃見詩，且喜且怒，顰眉蹙面，謂鶚曰：「君詞清絕，始見郎君，奈何末句折我南枝，似乎詩讖，恐妾與君佳會不久！」鶚云：「仙緣奇遇，正望情如膠漆，生則與子同處，死則與子同穴，何怒如此，欲遂生離？」笑桃曰：「郎是梅樹，妾猶花也，折以贈人，可乎？」次又謂鶚曰「生死在離合，自有定數，亦非人所能為。果應折取南枝，使妾之心進無所望，退無所守，雖欲再與君遇，不可得矣！」遂放聲大哭。玉顏聲嬌，坐客聞之，莫不流涕。鶚曰：「醉後詩詞，有何足憑？仙子之言，果為詩讖，豈折南枝繫仙子身命之所在耶？」鶚乃再賦一詩，以解其怒云：
　　春風勾引上瑤池，共賞瓊芳醉玉卮。
　　寄與花神須愛護，冰壺留浸向南枝。
　　群仙怒曰：「碧霞之殿，華胥之仙館也。南宮之仙，我之姊妹也。為君有仙骨，故以身相托，游君以華胥，飲君以瓊液。蓬苑之仙花，可為輕易折以與人？狂生之喜，酒之過量也。」遂令眾仙推鶚。鶚乃驚醒，身已在紅梅閣下矣。
　　時畫角催曉，玉龍東駕，天外清風徐引，梅邊香風襲人。鶚心緒恍惚不堪，起造紅梅閣上，即見仙宮所賦之詩，皆題壁上，墨跡未乾復望閣下，紅梅花開滿枝，唇輕點絳，面瑩凝酥；稍南一枝，獨出群花之外。鶚曰：「夜來所言折取南枝，此身墜於閣下，情人何在，不得同歸！」遂大怒，欲折之。其枝稍高，手不能及，便閣下呼一使，令折取春花忽墮數片於閣前，次第相成一韻：
　　昨夜蓬山共賞春，惜香憐玉最相親。
　　東風好與花為主，可折南枝贈故人？　　
　　王鶚看詩未畢，其使將南枝折下矣。
　　鶚將花枝持歸書院，以瓶貯之，痛惜流涕。是夜，聞人扣窗，鶚因是笑桃之來也，乃出迎之。見笑桃蹙眉皺黛，粉褪紅銷，舉止無聊，所言失序。鶚驚謂曰：「仙子何為苦惱狼藉如此耶？」笑桃曰：「為君壞找南枝，今妾何計歸故園邪？侍女分離，妾欲以侍情郎，郎有堂君在上，必不相容，進退無路，去止兩難。」王鶚曰：「既無歸路，正契僕情，幸諧同衾共枕之樂，安得有再來忽去之理？」笑桃曰：「兩人同心，誓不更改，豈不知桑中之奔為女字之恥，不告而娶為男子之非乎？」鶚曰：「父母雖嚴，心常愛我，以我懇告，必相憐憫。倘得允從，與子偕老，實所願也。」仙子曰：「若諧素願，與子相偶，不惟大有益於君，令君取富貴如反掌耳。」鶚曰：「願得成雙，何言富貴乎！」　
　　鶚遂入閣拜夫人。夫人曰：「何謂也？」鶚曰：「見有犯理之事，冒罪懇前，數日前遇仙女，已許鶚為配偶，其緣已偕，既無損於身，且在益於兒，為天上之仙儔，非圖人間之富貴。伏願容許，以伴讀書，而亦可進取，誓不別娶。」夫人驚曰：「兒想被妖精之所惑，故來發此狂言，果是神仙，豈染此凡俗？汝且遠之，勿以介意。久則奪爾神氣，壞爾形質，死在須臾，墮入鬼錄。父母養爾成氣，襲箕帚之業，惟不知汝心保為如此也！」　
　　夫人告於諫議，諫議曰：「我有法術，能制妖祟；從鶚之言，請試之。乃備大禮以迎新婦，大會賓客，先求有道仙官書靈符，候新婦至，降真香，沉香而焚之。果是神仙，何得畏懼？若是妖邪，豈敢進言！」　
　　遂擇日與鶚納婦，書請群僚，云：「新婦幼小，養在宅中，今日長成，宜其家室，故請同僚同光此席。」眾僚各備禮相送，諫議辭不受賀。乃集眾官寮屬，酒已三行，及燒斬邪符，焚降真沉香，令新婦出。笑桃同鶚拜於筵間，亦無所懼。新婦乃頂玲瓏鳳冠，攝玎　玉佩，長衫大袖，淡飾雅妝，繡履踏月，紈扇掩面，侍女扶持，相參禮拜，從容中度，殊無失節。合屬官僚皆稱賀。眾議曰：「新婦新郎，真神仙中人也。」須臾，左右侍從捧玳瑁盤，進百花鮫綃兩端，上奉翁姑；遺梅腦一盒，以奉眾上，香味襲人，非凡間之物。郡中士夫百姓，皆歡欣鼓舞。宴罷賓客，諫議謂夫人曰：「我家三世奉善，誓不殺生，征事平正，傳家清白，以慈祥接下，天遣仙女以配吾兒，果無疑矣。」自是養親以孝，勉夫以學，出言有文，治家有則。
　　當年朝廷選士，鶚以進身為重，晝夜攻書，忘餐廢寢。笑桃謂鶚曰：「何苦如此？」鶚曰：「進取之法，以苦為先。正揚名以顯父母之時，苟不勞心，實為虛度此生矣。」笑桃曰：「我為君先擬題目，令君是預備應試，可乎？」王鶚曰：「試官不識何人，子卻先知題目，亦不妄邪？」笑桃遂懷中取出三場題目示鶚。鶚曰：「子戲我乎？」笑桃曰：「君勿見疑。」鶚遂日夜於窗下按題研窮主意，操筆品題。數日間，思索近就。笑桃謂曰：「君文雖佳美，願為君賦之。」略不停思，一筆而就。引古援今，立意造辭，皆出人意表。鶚驚異之，歎曰：「真奇絕塵世！」遂熟記焉。試期之日，鶚別父母及笑桃而行，笑桃謂之曰：「前程在邇，切勿猖狂。」　
　　鶚到東京，領試題，皆笑桃所擬者。就便上卷，並無塗抹改易。主考咸稱「文章老健，必有神助之者。」稱為奇才，大魁天下。
　　鶚既得意，泥金之報，殆無虛日。忽御筆詔授眉州簽判。鶚歸辭父母親戚，攜笑桃之任。前眉州太守已替，新太守未來，遂權郡印。
　　忽一日，有守門吏報云：「有一秀才，姓巴名潛，言與權郡有親，故來相訪。」遂至廳上，乃見其人頂平目深，高唇長舌，鬢卷髮長，其容貌雖粗欲之常人，其言語乃文章之秀士，一進一退，燦然有禮。王鶚曰：「素昧平生，有何姻眷？」秀才曰：「潛本巴郡人，寄居眉州三峰山下讀書，積有年矣。為與汝夫人有親，故到於此。一日權州到任，失於探問，不得講探親之禮，幸恕狂率。請略告夫人。」　
　　鶚遂入宅，謂笑桃曰：「有一秀才，姓巴名潛，言與夫人有親。」笑桃聞之情思不樂，謂鶚曰：「彼乃妖精，急以劍擊之！」秀才見鶚急來，有殺氣，指鶚謂曰：「汝妻是我妻，未蒙見還，反欲害我。」便下砌走。鶚急遣人追之，不知所在。
　　鶚謂笑桃曰：「彼何故有此事？」笑桃謂鶚曰：「君相遇情好，恕妾之始末，不可不諭。妾乃上界仙花一枝紅梅也，身已列於仙品。時西王母邀上帝，設宴，令仙苑群花盡開，以候上帝之觀望。時妾適因群仙宴，酒醉未醒，有違敕旨，遂得罪，便令人將妾自天門推下，隨落三峰山下。妾既推下，殘命未蘇，久之，遂依根於石上，附體於岩前，迎春再發，以候赦而復歸仙苑。不意所居之地有一巨穴，中有巴蛇。此畜壽年千歲，乃聚土石之怪、花木之妖於洞，恣逞其欲。妾乃被脅入洞中，欲效歡娛。妾乃仙花，誓死不從。此畜愛妾貌美，又且畏天行誅，監妾於後洞。一日，此畜歸巴中看親，妾乃乘間走出洞門，復歸三峰山下。斯時太守張仕遠適來此山，見此紅梅一株，香色殊異，乃移妾栽向閣之東。栽近月餘，巴蛇歸穴，探知其事，欲謀害張仕遠以奪妾。張公乃正直之人，嘗有鬼神擁護，無可奈何。一日，張公解任，除唐安郡守，愛妾此花，攜之入蜀，栽於唐安郡東閣內。張公解任之時，則妾已得地，本固根深，不容轉移，於是久住於蜀。妾遇君時，有姊妹數人，雖群花之仙，非品格之仙也。而妾乃居南宮，君舊折我南枝，曾為墮落。自此南宮既壞，我無可依。配君數年，男女已長，妾亦塵緣將盡，復居仙苑，異時為天上人也。」鶚聞之，乃思前日詩意折花之讖，勸勉笑桃，幸無介意。
　　後數日，群僚請太守眾官合宅家著聚住三峰山下遊賞。笑桃聞邀同往，不肯前去。王鄂強之。至三峰山下，妓女列宴，笙歌滿地，遊人歡悅，車馬駢闐。至暮，忽一陣狂風吹沙拔木，天地昏暗，雷奔雨驟，人皆驚避，乃見一大蛇從穴中而出，官吏奔走，鶚亦上馬，令左右衛護宅眷以歸。須臾，有一騎吏馳至宅內，急報太守：「有一大蛇，形如白練，擁了宜人轎子入穴。」鶚舉身內撲，哭不勝悲。
　　次日，令人往三峰山下尋覓蹤跡，惟有紅履在地。王鶚曰：「此乃孽畜所害。」計無所施，乃急修書以報父母。
　　一日，郡中有一先生，衣鹿皮衣，來郡衙求謁。門吏不宵通報。先生叱門吏，直至廳前。先生揖云：「知權州有不足之事，貧道故來解之。」鶚曰：「我之不足，君安解之？」對曰：「巴蛇害人性命，何不殺之？」遂請至階，及坐，問：「先生有何術可以御之？」曰：「來日與君同住三峰山下。」　
　　乃以壯士百人，直至穴前。先生畫地為壇，叩齒百遍，望天門吸氣，吹入穴中。須臾，穴內如雷聲，其中文乃挺身穴中而出，身長五丈餘，赤目鐵鱗，一見先生，欲張口吞之。先生大叫一聲，震動山谷，其蛇乃盤繞。先生取下瓢，下火數點。須臾，火起十餘丈，旋繞大蛇於火中燒死，白骨如雪。先生乃取火丹入瓢。鶚曰：「感荷先生大恩，今孽畜燒死，已報其仇。欲得宜人屍骨歸葬，吾願足矣。」　
　　先生遂與鶚領軍士入洞中。行至一里餘，見洞中崢嶸，朱簾半卷。先生將人其門，見仙洞高明，花亭池沼，絕無鳥跡，唯亂花深處，乃有群女出焉。笑桃亦在其列。鶚見笑桃，喚曰：「王鶚來尋宜人。」笑桃答曰：「妾在此無恙。」鶚遂與笑桃並眾人出穴，一同拜謝先生。先生曰：「今日之事，滿吾願也。」吾非凡人，乃三峰山下萬歲大王。為孽畜居穴中，累被他害，終不能報，遂往名山拜求神仙，欲覓方術，蒙仙師授我火丹之訣。」言罷，只見大虎踴躍，大叫於三峰山下，先生忽然不見。
　　王鶚乃與笑桃並輪歸州，郡僚宴賀。
　　朱及半年，忽有吏報云：「家有書至。」鶚開視之，其中云「汝可歸畢姻陳氏」事。時笑桃在旁，見書泣曰：「妾不負君，君何負我？」鶚曰：「我前日修書奉父母，宜人已被害，而敬以達之父母，蓋深惜痛之也。不意父母念我遠宦，為結陳侍郎家婚姻，不知宜人復為先生救出。今當再修書以報父母知之，則可以速退陳侍郎家婚姻也。」笑桃曰：「不可。前日報妾已死，今日報妾復生。若退陳氏親事，則必問其事之由。既說巴蛇所驅，人必疑巴蛇所生子女之辱，當何言哉？有何面目歸見翁姑？妾已隨君有年，子女俱已長成，節緣已盡。妾所居南宮之地，今復修成，妾當歸矣。君宜念妾所生子女，宜加保護，毋以妾為念。君若不棄，異日紅梅閣下再敘舊歡。」言汔淚下。王鶚子女相抱而泣，不勝其悲。笑桃辭王鶚，下階，衣不拽地，望空而去。鶚追不及，抱子女哀哭，晝夜不絕。郡中聞者，皆為哽咽。
　　鶚愁腸如結，離恨如絲，攜子女以入房，痛鸞鳳之折伴，遂將郡印帖於僚屬，乃攜子女還家，以構陳氏之好。
　　鶚雖再娶，而意不滿所懷，遂囑托朝宰，改任向蜀。未幾，詔授唐安郡君。鶚喜，趣裝，攜子女之任。
　　未及半月，早到唐安。騎從擁後，旌旗導前，竹馬來迎。受賀方畢，遂載酒肴，攜子女，直詣紅梅閣上，敘舊日之情。花豔重研，鶚乃指梅謂子女曰：「母當時臨別約我來也。區區既到，何得無情？」子女號哭，鶚亦傷心，乃題詩於壁以記云：　
　　「宦游何幸入皇都，高閣紅梅尚未枯。臨別贈言今驗記，南枝留浸向冰壺。」　
　　鶚乃畫一軸紅梅仙子，永為奉祀；伏願男登高第，女嫁名家，地久天長，流傳萬古。
　　相思記　
　　洪武元年，有馮琛者，字伯玉，成都府人也。其父馮　，為元朝先鋒，生琛於金陵，時至元六年庚戌歲。父喪，生幼恃伊舅氏養育。長至總角，穎悟聰明，詞章翰墨，與世不相侔，特出乎人表。
　　未幾年，南北盜起，生奔走流離，浪跡江湖，飄至臨安府。時直殿將軍趙或見生，大奇異之。趙公無子，遂收為己子。生事之如親父。公有女名雲瓊，幼喪母，公命庶母劉氏育之。年至一十三歲，則生延師教之。生愈加恭敬如親妹，而瓊視生亦如親兄。
　　一日，生因思干戈不寧，惻然有感，賦詩以呈師云：
　　兩虎爭難勢不休，回頭何處是神州；
　　一朝鼙鼓喧天動，萬里塵埃匝地浮。
　　白日豺狼當路道，黃昏烽火起邊樓；
　　何時南北干戈息，重睹君王舊冕旒？　　
　　其師誦畢，自稱曰：「此子日後有大志，非常才也。」趙公亦喜。
　　將二載，劉氏以雲瓊年長及笄，遂乃令入閨房，習學女工。
　　一日，生在書館獨坐，見春風明媚，蜂蝶交飛，不覺惆悵，呤一絕云：
　　桃花如錦草如茵，妝點園林無限春。
　　蜂蝶分飛緣底事？東君應念斷腸人。
　　生吟畢，雲瓊在書館後遊玩，聽其吟詩，有惆悵之意，悒怏不樂。
　　越數日，百共亭前牡丹盛開。琛往觀之，瓊亦在彼，遂同玩賞。瓊同曰：「『東君應念斷腸人，』為誰作也？」生笑而不答，又將牡丹花為題，吟詩一首云：
　　嬌姿豔質解傾城，似語還休意未成；
　　一點芳心誰共訴，千重密葉苦相同。
　　君王愛處天香滿，妃子觀時國色盈；
　　何幸倚欄同一賞，恨無杯酒泛芳馨。
　　瓊見詩，知生意屬於己，乃一笑，歎息而去；回頭顧生，惟不言焉。
　　生自此之後，見其姿容秀麗，其心不能自持。瓊娘此後亦無心針指，時出遊戲消遣。見蜂蝶紛紛，景物繁華，賦詩一首云：
　　春色平分二月時，弓鞋款款步蓮池；
　　九迴腸斷無由訴，一點芳心不自持。
　　灼灼奇花留粉蝶，陰陰枯木囀黃鸝；
　　曉來悶對妝台立，巧畫蛾眉為阿誰？　　
　　瓊有侍女韶華，頗巧慧，能謳詩，見瓊長吁短歎，識其意而不敢問。一日，偶過書館，生戲之曰：「我萬里無家，一身孤孑，子與我結為兄妹，何如？」韶華答曰：「賤妾卑微，何敢投君子？」生曰：「無傷。」二人即拜為兄妹。自此之後，與生來往甚密。
　　一日，生問曰：「連日不見瓊娘，果恙乎？」答曰：「娘子近來得一瘧疾，倚牀作《望江南》一闋。生曰：「願聞。」韶華誦云：「香閨內，空自想佳期。獨步花陰情緒亂，漫將珠淚兩行垂，勝會在何時？----懨懨病，此夕最難持。一點芳心無托處，荼　架上月遲遲，惆悵有誰知？」　韶華誦畢，別生而去。生知瓊有意於己，潸然淚下。
　　次日，趙公會宴，瓊侍父側，雖然視目往來，不能通得一語為憾。生歸室，見寶鴨香消，銀台燭暗，愁懷萬斛，展轉至晚，乃賦一律云：
　　暗思昨日可憐宵，得見佳人粉黛嬌；
　　銀海曉含珠淚濕，金蓮微動玉鉤搖。
　　謝鯤從折機邊齒，弄玉空吹月下簫；
　　一笑傾城殊絕代，寧教不瘦沈郎腰！　　
　　一日，生與韶華曰：「我有手書一緘，煩汝送與瓊娘，幸勿沉滯。」韶華接去，乃潛納於鏡奩內。
　　次早，瓊娘梳妝見書，視之，乃《滿庭芳》詞，云：
　　「蟬鬢拖雲，蛾眉掃月，天生麗質難描。尊前席上，百媚千嬌。一點芳心初動，五更情興偏饒，訴衷腸不盡，虛度好良宵。
　　秦樓明月夜，餘音裊裊，吹徹鸞簫，閒敲棋子，愈覺無聊何時識得東風面，堪成風友鸞交？憑鴻雁，潛通尺素，盼殺董妖嬈。」　　
　　瓊娘讀畢，怒責韶華曰：「汝怎傳消遞息？我與夫人說知，必難容矣。」韶華悲泣哀告。瓊意稍解，乃曰：「舍人何以知我病，送藥方與我？當以實對。」韶華答曰：「向者舍人妾言曰：『我四海無親，欲與結為兄妹。』當時妾惶愧不敢當。復問：『娘子無恙乎』？妾曰：『因病，稍安』。妾復讀娘子《望江南》詞與聽，舍人不覺淚下。至晚，以書令妾達焉。」瓊曰：「我雖未愈，不服此藥，亦不可辜其美意。我回一緘以謝之。」　
　　韶華即候瓊作書畢，以詣生室。生見韶華，甚喜。生執觀之，乃和《滿庭芳》一闋，云：
　　「短短金針，纖纖玉手，閒將緩帶輕描。描鸞刺鳳，想象剔還挑。不覺黃昏又到，誰知玉減香消。鴛鴦思轉輾，又忽至中宵。
　　陽台魂夢杳，彩鸞歸去，辜負文簫。美人生幾，行樂陶陶。何日相逢一面，樽前唱徹紅綃。知此時，芳心動也。愁殺蓋寬饒。」　　
　　生視畢，不覺失魂喪志，莫知身之所在。
　　瓊曰：「彼時以我病癒，兄妹之情，喜之。」當時，韶華頗疑之，退而歎曰：「人生莫作妾婢身，城門失火。殃及池魚。後必貽禍於我矣！」自此，非堂前有命，不出於外。瓊雖意戀，無由相會。
　　生自此之後，竟不得見，憔悴疲倦，飲食減少。夫人劉氏時加寬慰，生但亻免首而已。
　　一日，夫人與侍妾數人，於後花園迎風亭上觀賞荷花。瓊推疾不出。夫人去後，瓊潛至生室，問曰：「兄何恙乎？」生淚下，不能答。瓊曰：「萬事由天定，非由人矣。兄何故如此？嘗聞夫子曰『賢賢易色』，古聖人所戒。」生曰「鑽穴逾牆，吟琴折齒，妹獨不知？」言未終，侍妾報曰：「夫人至。」瓊曰：「且與告辭，情話難盡。翌日牛女佳期，妾當陳瓜果，暮與君登樓乞巧，以占靈配。」生諾。
　　至期，生乃赴約。劉氏命瓊在堂行酒，亦召生與宴。不勝懊惱。仰觀其天，輕去翳月，乍明乍暗，織女牽牛，黯淡莫辯。忽聽樵樓鼓已三更，乃賦詩曰：
　　幾度如梳上碧空，缺多圓少古今同；
　　正期得見嫦娥面，又被癡雲半掩籠。
　　次日，於堂側偶見瓊，生以引詩示之。瓊亦吟一絕云：
　　停杯對月問蟾蜍，獨宿嫦娥似妾無；
　　今日逢君言未盡，令人長恨命多孤。
　　瓊自後作事，悶悶不已，女工之事，俱無情意。患病數日，家人驚惶，乃白劉氏。
　　夫人即喚韶華，曰：「汝知娘子病源乎？」韶華不敢答。夫人問之再三，華無奈，只得白諸夫人，乃曰：「娘子與馮官人相見之後，至今三好兩怯。」　
　　夫人即與公曰：「嘗聞男冠而有室，女笄而有家。今瓊年二十，閨房之事，想已知之。自琛居於門下，亦有年矣。而瓊豈無思念之心？妾觀動靜之間，俱有不足之意。不如早納琛為婿，庶免彰人之耳目。」公大怒，不允；尋思良久，曰：「依汝之言，必無惑矣。」時韶在側，奔告於瓊。瓊令華告生。生喜，賦詩一首賀云：
　　昨日窗前問簡篇，銀钅工雙結並頭蓮；
　　當時似此非容易，今日方知豈偶然。
　　紅葉溝中傳密意，赤繩月下結姻緣；
　　從前多少心頭事，盡付東流水一川。
　　翌日，公或探生。生曰：「投托門下，多蒙厚意，敢效結草之恩。」公曰：「或欲納汝為婿，不知可乎？」生曰：「既蒙有命，安敢不從。」遂喜而退。
　　越十日，公命媒約行聘為婿。至期。屏開孔雀，褥隱芙蓉，花燭熒煌歌，歌弦管沸。生與瓊拜於堂，一如神仙旭洞府，郎才女貌世間稀。
　　飲罷，筵散，生女入洞房。象牀瑤席，風枕鴛衾。生與瓊曰：「昔慕娘子之心，每於花前上，撫景傷懷，今日至此，非天緣何如！」瓊曰：「遇君之後，行無定跡，寢不貼席，今日天隨人願，獲侍巾櫛。但願君子始終如一，則萬幸矣。」瓊擬蜂戀蝶意，遂以詞云：「翠荷叢裡鴛鴦浴，碧桃枝上鸞鳳宿。花爛枝上柔，俄驚一夜秋。百歲共和諧，相看奈汝河。」　　
　　生亦口占《減字木蘭花》詞云：
　　「詞云弄雨，迤邐羅幃同笑語。春透花枝，一時相憐相愛，還了平生債。魚水歡情，髮下青絲結誓盟。」　　
　　越月，公被召，促裝赴京，囑托生家事而別。
　　越三月，公奏曰：「臣老，不堪用。有婿馮琛，素懷異才，臣薦為國，非私也。」上大悅遣使召生。
　　生與瓊曰：「蒙旨徵召，暫與相別。」瓊曰：「相會未幾而又遽別，奈何！妾聞金陵勝地，多有歌樓妓女，切不可以留戀。」生曰：「噫！卿誤也。我心猶如冰玉，後當自見。」言畢，即促行裝起程。
　　瓊令韶華備酒，飲別於郊外。瓊握生手，相視大慟。生亦嗚咽。瓊曰：「君今棄妾，妾無負於君。」生曰：「今日之行，出於無奈。卿有是言，殆非以為陌路人邪！」瓊曰：「君無二心，妾何以報！」口占二首以贈云：
　　魚水歡娛未一秋，臨岐分袂更綢繆；
　　訴君不盡衰腸事，惟有潸潸珠淚流。
　　香閨繡幕恨悠悠，一片離情不自由；
　　爭奈君心似流水，滔滔東去不能留。
　　生亦呤一律以答之：
　　懶上雕鞍悶不勝，此心如醉為多情；
　　空垂眼底千行淚，難阻天涯萬里程。
　　最苦淒涼馮伯玉，可憐憔悴趙雲瓊；
　　男兒且學四方志，鐵石心腸作廣平。
　　思瓊情不能已，又作《茶瓶詞》云：
　　「憶昔當年相會，共結百年姻配。枕邊盟誓如山海，此意千載難買。----恩和愛，知何在？情默默，有誰揪採？妾心未改君先改，爭奈好事多成敗。」　　
　　吟畢，痛哭不捨。
　　生又扶瓊至家，囑韶華勸慰。次早，不令瓊知而去。瓊晚見月界窗痕，風嗚紙隙，舉目無親，因作《臨江仙》詞云：
　　「明窗紙隙風如箭，幾多心事多忘。荼　架不見行藏。交加雙粉蝶，並肩兩鴛鴦。----豈知今日成拋棄，　羸減玉銷香。誰與訴衷腸？行雲空縹緲，恨殺楚襄王。」
　　生行不覺月餘，未嘗不思瓊也。及見京畿將近，偶成一律云：
　　冉冉時光日似梭，相思無計欲如何；
　　五雲縹緲皇都近，萬里迢遙客恨多。
　　愁望銀河有織女，飛魂閣苑問仙娥；
　　金陵漫說花如錦，一點芳心只自和。
　　生行至金陵，見上於奉天殿，上甚愛其才，即日除授為起居郎。一日出朝，因見便人，作書以寄：
　　「雲瓊娘子妝前：拜違懿范，已經月餘，思仰香閨，動靜行止，未嘗離於左右。邇來未審淑候何如？琛至京，蒙授起居郎。誰料非才，幸際風雲之會，得依日月之光。偶因風便，封緘以寄眷戀之秋私云。」
　　瓊得書，一喜一悲。賀者填門，瓊悲號不已，劉氏命具具杯酌，弦歌寬慰。瓊編《駐馬聽》，命韶華謳之，聞者莫不悽慘。自茲命無聊賴，鸞孤鳳只，竹瘦梅臞，面似梨花帶雨，眉如楊柳含煙，因風涼月冷，影只形單，賦詩一律云：
　　夜深獨坐對殘燈，默默懷人百感增；
　　愁腸百結如絲亂，珠淚千行似雨傾。
　　月照紗窗光皎皎，風搖鐵馬響鈴鈴；
　　總籍夫人寬慰我，金樽漫有酒如澠。
　　素娥善能言語，一日瓊曰：「妾聞西湖鴛鴦失侶，相思而死，何謂也？」瓊曰：「汝戲我乎？」曰：「既知，何不自思？」瓊曰：「汝不聞李白云：錦水連天碧，蕩漾雙鴛鴦。甘同一處死，不忍兩分張。」素娥曰：「誰無夫婦，如賓似友，至於離合，故不可測。《關睢》詩曰『樂雖盛而不失其正，憂雖深而不害於和』，是以傳之於經。娘子朝夕哭泣，過於哀怨，倘有不測，將如之何？望以身命為重。」瓊意稍解。恐生心有異，不能無疑焉，乃作古風一章以自慰云：
　　「憶昔與君相拜別，三月鵑聲哀夜月，鴛鴦帳裡彩鸞孤，惆悵良人音信絕。妾心如水水復深，妾淚如珠珠濺血，深院夫人春晝長，幾回獨把湘簾揭。湘簾揭起雙飛燕，燕燕差池相眷戀。令人感動心益悲，欲寄征鴻飛不便。文君空有白頭呤，婕妤漫賦齊紈扇。君心若似我心同，妾亦於君復何怨！」
　　瓊作雖非怨悔，相思之心殊切。撫景興懷，時無休息。佇見征鴻北去，烏鵲南飛，寒蛩在壁，秋水連天，桐風颯颯，桂月娟娟，香殘燭暗，枕冷衾寒。斯時也，空閨寂寂，人各一天，經年累月，有誰見憐？遂作《滿庭芳》詞云：
　　「皓月娟娟，青燈灼灼，回身轉過西廂，可人才子，流落在他鄉。只望團圓到底，反屬參商。君知否，星橋別後，一日九迴腸。
　　相思無盡極，慘雲愁雨，減玉消香，幾回夢裡飛揚。猶記山盟海誓，地久天長。春已老，桃花無主，何日遇劉郎？」
　　題畢，謂韶華曰：「古之女，亦有如我者乎？」答曰：「有之。如秦氏之喪身，姜女之死節，皆如此也。然悲歡離合，亦自古有之。若不惜其身，至以殞絕，亦或有之。」瓊曰：「汝之言，我非不知，但恨與生會合未久，遽成離別，恐作王魁負桂英也。」因而賦歌一首云：
　　「黃昏漸近兮，白日頹西。對景思人兮，我心空悲。雲歸岫兮去遠，霞映水兮呈輝。倏無光兮黯淡，月初出兮星稀。歎南飛兮烏鵲，繞樹枝兮無依。人凴欄兮徒倚，追往事兮嗟吁。香消玉減兮，顏落色衰。陟高庭兮眺望，仍凝思兮遲遲。霜凋殘兮落葉，雨滴損兮花枝。花委謝兮寂寂，葉辭枯兮淒淒。恨關山兮路遠，極望兮天涯。自勉強兮假寐，風颯颯兮吹衣。奈好夢兮杳渺，匆驚覺兮鄰雞。何汝台兮抑鬱，臨寶鏡兮慘妻。一鬢雲鬢兮，為誰梳洗？蘭心蕙質兮，空自昏迷。睹雙飛兮粉蝶，聽百囀兮黃鸝。何人生兮不若，嗟物類兮如斯。愧年少兮多別離，望美人兮空躊躕。」
　　韶華觀其吟，亦掩淚，謂瓊曰：「娘子之意，恐生有『富易交、貴易妻』之謂也。若此者，可令人齎書與之，以察其動靜可矣。何乃孤眠獨宿，行吁坐歎，而且苦若此邪？」瓊曰：「書，不必也，自生別後，有詩十餘篇，並錄寄贈，以見我心。」即日遣家童，齎書抵京。
　　生得書，不勝歡喜，展而讀之，皆瓊之佳制。云：
　　淚雨汪汪酒滿衣，含愁強賦斷腸詩；
　　自從昔日相分手，直至今朝懶畫眉。
　　東閣尚懷揮翰墨，西園猶想折花枝；
　　自君一去無消息，獨對青銅怨別離。
　　生讀罷，不勝悲咽，遂差人接瓊抵京。
　　瓊謂韶曰：「我今將去，汝從我去何如？」韶曰：「妾幼侍夫人，居於內閣之中，亦生死相隨。今夫人將行，妾願隨侍。」即日治裝而去。
　　直抵金陵。離城五里許，生已預在郊外等候。瓊至，既見，生曰：「一別許久，不想今日復見儀容。」瓊再拜謝，曰：「妾女流也。不知禮法，荷蒙君在子不棄，誓同生死。」言畢，即令乘轎歸衙。
　　重尋舊約，再整前盟。生喜，賦詩一律云：　
　　朱顏一別已經春，兩地相思各慘神；
　　失意如今還得意，舊人偏覺勝新人。
　　顛鸞倒鳳情何洽，誓海盟山樂更真；
　　寄語司天台上客，更籌促漏莫交頻。
　　綢繆間，不覺五更至矣。生整衣冠而進朝。
　　俄聞倭夷有警，上賜生為靖海將軍。生即日承命，至衙，謂瓊云：「吾奉君命，領兵收賊，料有一載之別。汝保重。吾不敢久留，以緩君命。」於是率鳳陽精兵四萬，上親勞軍士。同兵部尚書於斌，左平章廖禹，復率羽林衛五十八萬軍馬，旌旗蔽野，水陸前進。
　　生之英風銳氣，時與倭夷鏖戰。倭夷詐敗佯走，生兵追之。倭度其半入，以精兵五十萬，出其不意，問別道尾其後。官軍溺死者無數，江水為之不流。生呼謂眾曰：「今天敗我，非眾人之罪也。第無以報效！」　
　　生復招集殘兵，整頓軍旅，身先士卒。眾乃奮身戮力，與敵鏖戰，無不一以當百。倭夷大敗。生喜曰：「不意天兵之果銳也如此！」倭夷遣使稱臣求和。生恐有變，許之，奏凱而還。
　　上得捷音，天顏大悅，謂宋景曰：「以羸敗之兵人危險之地而能克敵者，皆卿之舉薦得其人也。」景稽首拜曰：「遇臣無琛之明敏果斷。」得其人，不負臣下之望。」上曰：「古有社稷之臣，今馮琛近之矣。」　
　　生引兵人玄武門。上召生入丹陛。上慰勞之曰：「克戰之功，出於卿也。」生拜曰：「陛下順天行道，御物無私，臣下奉行政令而已，何功之有！」上即敕生為鎮國大將軍，賜劍履趨朝。雲瓊封為趙國夫人，金冠霞帔。夫榮妻貴，近臣未有。
　　夫何盛極有衰，天年不遠，洪武七年甲寅歲十一月初一日壬戌薨。病重之夕，執瓊手云：吾負汝矣。路隔幽冥，不一相見也。」急呼家童燃燈，取筆題曰：
　　九泉未敢忘恩愛，一死無由報主恩。
　　君命妾情俱未了，空留怨氣塞乾坤。
　　瓊曰：「君無憂也，不久當相見。」言未畢，生卒。
　　次日，大夫宋　奏聞。上曰：「天何奪吾伯玉之速也？」命禮部官具棺槨，擬以王禮祭之。贈明仁忠烈成安王。
　　越十五日丙子，瓊亦以憂思，不進飲食而卒。敕賜合葬於彩石之陽。
　　越一月，御祭。墓碑丹書，命陶凱篆刻，宋　作序。
　　有子二人。長曰明德，娶尚平公主。次子明烈，娶廖禹之女。是為記之。
　　蛤蟆吐丹記　
　　天順時，青川孔天　，性酷好仙，常遇黃冠及名山大川。宮觀真像，即虔禮之。進古太山回，遇一老人，黃冠杖履，呼天　曰：「子好道乎？」曰：「心誠好之，但未得入道之門耳。老人曰：「汝知煉蛤蟆之術否？」曰「不知。」老人袖取一緘與之，曰：「功滿三年，蛤蟆忽失去。再逾三年，道可成矣。勉之！勉之！」　
　　天　意老人異人也，不敢輕啟其封。至家，焚香，始開之，內皆符咒訣法。遂擇日取蛤蟆，依法修煉。每咒，則蛤蟆開口，燒符，則吞之。
　　遂精心煉及三年，忽不見。又三年，復回，生兩翅，身赤，能飛語告天　曰：「昔授子術者，乃中宮上德真君。予吞符限滿時，有老人在黃雲中召我，不覺一躍而至其前，袖我而去。去上六菜花山黃鶴洞，愛戒三十六月，始命我吞坤精丹，飲無極水。赤身生翅，能御風雲，瞬息千里，亦得與天同壽矣。真君許我度子後，令入月宮為蟾蜍伴也。」言畢，委首張口，吐二丹，金光絢耀，複語曰：「五月望，天道吉日，一丹子食之，一丹可燒以茅山芝，便成鶴，騎赴南泉，自有金童為子導也。」囑罷而飛入雲中，渺而不見。依其言，遂仙去。
　　弘治十八年，鄰人張四老見其與黃冠道士在太山游。
第九卷    
　　金蘭四友傳　
　　時海宇奠安，民物康阜，祥光拱瑞，文學聯輝，而崇尚風情雅義者，此時為最。趙州有李生名嶠者，字巨山，父岳，任潯州刺史，母趙氏懷孕時夢神人遺雙筆而生。九歲能屬文，年登二八，而神氣英杰，有清高絕塵之姿，有溫柔雅淡之態，平易之中涵蓄無窮，真乃無瑕之白壁，出世之豐采，平生不常有者也。且性敏學博，善於詩賦歌調，非天挺人傑者乎！惟目盼者而傾心愛慕，咸欲納交而不可得焉。
　　有趙州欒城縣姓蘇者，名易道，字子游，父賢，任鳳闕舍人，母林氏懷孕十二月而生。年弱冠時，貌亦卓雅，賦詩倒三峽之狂瀾，議論驚四筵之雄辯。時因訪親，往趙州經過，途遇得睹而切慕之，奈何難以相契，抵家之後常注心目，瞻仰至極，每懷吟風弄月之思。秋日無聊，獨吟一律以自紀云：
　　虛庭空翠古秋光，倏忽人間一夜長；
　　零露滴開黃菊冷，西風吹散芰荷香。
　　孤燈挑盡難成夢，橫笛傳聲易斷腸；
　　遍倚高樓人不見，寒山月色共蒼茫。
　　又繼之以倦，作尋芳詞一闋云：
　　「梧桐泣雨，滴作秋聲，小院閒書永。木葉飄黃，正是惱人時候。夜悠悠，心耿耿，懶拈蘭麝燒金獸。捲簾兒，正憑高望遠，幾回翹首。見愁顏滿面，瓦盞金鍾，珍珠紅酒。半醉醒來，此恨依然還在，淚滴秋衫招舞袖。寒肌弱體仍消瘦，這情懷訴與誰，問君知否？」　
　　既而秋去冬來，天寒地凍，雪滾風生，獨坐孤眠，寂寥殊甚。正納悶間，忽有趙州人姓杜名審言，字必簡，原籍湖廣襄陽人，祖飲，任趙州刺史，遂世居焉。素有雄才豐雅，長於吟詠，時往欒城縣公幹，因借宿於店，會道於途。請入中堂。問其姓名、居地，宰雞為黍以待之。與之論及世故，見其英杰超雅，亦重風情，詢曰：「貴州有李生名嶠者，公曾會否？」言微笑而答曰：「是予之表弟也。先生何以會之？」道曰：「前因訪親，路經貴州，途次相逢，盼想英容，至今不暇，但未知其人心緒如何？」言曰：「丰姿則超越絕塵，高出於斯世。論才思，則揮毫賦就，馳騁於古人。士君子咸見重焉。」道曰：「美則美矣，奈何云山阻隔，無以相逢。」言笑：「容生回家偕彼來拜，可乎？」道致恭而謝曰：「誠如是焉，犬馬當報。」遂口占一歌云：
　　相思幾夜梅花發，瘦影橫窗月初白；
　　簾外誰來扣我門，開窗乃見風流客。
　　密意難傳今有托，眉頭清淚都彈卻；
　　一夜相逢百夜心，飲餘對月頻斟酌。
　　歌罷，成一絕以戲之：
　　梅有香兮菊有芳，栽培總不屬劉郎。
　　東風欲借吹噓力，只恐枝頭不放香。
　　道歎曰：「以梅菊比人，以劉郎比我，以東風比己，真可謂吟詠者矣。」越日告別，道以色絹二端，京履一雙贈之。謙辭再三方受。仍置酒餞別。
　　言抵家，閒步嶠館，將前事備述。嶠悅然有偕行之念。
　　越數日，言與嶠同具嘉光絹二端，絨包二幅、京履二雙、羅帕二方，命僕隨行，逕投欒城來拜。道知，整衣出迎。見其色類潘安，溫而柔，和而雅，實蓋世之英賢也。嶠盼道丰標拔萃，純厚超群，細而沉，清而淡，誠亙古之君子也。遂延入高軒。達禮接談之際，道喜容舒暢，勃然踴躍，顧盼無暇。二人將齎儀恭獻。道曰：下顧足矣，敢納厚賜乎？「謙讓拜領。遂設香醪，列珍饌，極度豐盛，嶠見禮儀周密，答問恭敬，有緬想之懷，道盼嶠風情秀逸，懸切慕之私。
　　日暮，嶠與言告別，道款留甚殷，遂止之，臨夜，筵散，迎入書館但見琴書懸架，香噴金猊，藤牀繡幕，珊枕暖衾，嶠曰：「聞先生老於詩學，迢迢良夜，見教可乎？」道答曰：「鄙陋庸才，不堪上聞。」詰甚，遂吟一絕：
　　對看風月一簾間，杯酒今宵莫放殘。
　　千里有緣須共醉，明朝且莫唱《陽關》。
　　嶠曰：「字字鏗鏘，句句清奇。」道笑曰：「勿哂足矣，何勞過羨？」二人款敘更深，不覺樵鼓四餘，言辭就寢。嶠燈前卸冠挈　，微露玉骨冰肌，渾白壁之無瑕，恍璉瑚之新琢。道目觸感懷，惶惶有失，趑趄然而隔宿也。
　　越日，二人又告別，道挽手而止之，曰：「敝處有景，名曰澗浦，水秀山奇，四時花草，各逞其麗，蒼松翠竹，古柏瓊枝，足以玩目適情。若不見棄，同與一遊，可乎？」嶠曰：「既有佳景，再停一日何妨。」　
　　次日，命僕具壺觴，邀二客同往觀焉。遍歷佳景，並履岩岸。言曰：「勝會不偶，二公俱優文墨，可無一言以記之乎？」嶠曰：「百木凋零，梅香獨噴，請以梅為題。」道先吟曰：
　　玉骨冰肌絕點塵，歲寒心事寄何人；
　　當時不做東君伴，肯與風流贈小春。
　　嶠曰：「子建以七步成詩，公不侍七步而成，過於子建多矣。」道曰：「獻醜！勿訝！」嶠曰：「豈不涉於戲乎！予當一和之。」吟曰：
　　玉容清致出風塵，更有餘香取可人；
　　萬紫千紅都讓後，隴頭先放一枝春。
　　嶠詩既成，復顧言曰：「吾二人既詠，表兄何默然而已？」言曰：「二君以梅為題，我意不欲如是也。」即成一律云：
　　漫攜竹杖與芒鞋，笑踐天台頂上來；
　　野鳥不驚閑習慣，白雲長共賞山杯。
　　怪嶺千層峰聳翠，簾前一帶水縈回；
　　滿天風雨誰收拾，折得梅花兩袖回。
　　道暢然亦成一律云：
　　簾前景致聞今古，載酒冬游莫話遲；
　　賴有雲山同意趣，豈無梅菊共襟期。
　　天將好景留人玩，我把風流拉故知；
　　勝概盡堪重拭目，教人何不強題詩。
　　又奉酒，醉吟一律云：
　　憑君滿酌酒，聽我醉中吟；
　　客路如天遠，侯門似海深。
　　夕陽侵古道，白髮戀顏新；
　　惟有人間事，須弘濟物心。
　　或談笑，或吟詠，不覺紅輪西墜，杯盤狼藉，乃起而歸。
　　行至城半，嶠容含洞口之桃花，臉襯九重之春色，啟絳唇，就途以拜別。道答曰：「不厭草舍，更以一宿，何如？」嶠曰：「固所願也，但恐貽父母之懷。」道聞其言，不敢強留，遂遣僕馳家問老夫人取雲絹一匹、朝履二雙、川扇四握。須臾，僕齎物至，親貢之。二人力讓不止，方受。乃趨步送別。回家，歎曰：「杜子誠有信之士也，若得此子相契，心願足矣。因調《踏莎行》詞一闋以娛情云：
　　「春暖征鴻，秋寒歸雁，何時再得重機見？閒情俱赴水東流，怪天下與人方便。新恨重添，舊愁難輾，寸心愈報千年怨。不如昨夜莫相逢，山窗寂寂空庭院。」　　
　　夜深，展轉思慕，又口占一絕云：
　　寒更承夜永，涼夕向秋澄；
　　離心何以贈，自有玉壺冰。
　　道自別嶠之後，朝夕企慕，無時不釋於懷。越數日，與僕乘舟往趙州回拜。及登岸，輳遇言鄉回，挽手問曰：「公來何事？」答曰：「敬來叩拜，今又值逢，正所謂『天遣香階靜處逢，』誠此之謂矣。」言遂延人中堂，設宴西軒相款。
　　次日，同往李嶠館內來拜，不遇。道入其書軒，見滿架經書，卷插牙籤，壁懸焦尾，畫掛孤梅，遂援筆題詩於軸而返。詩曰：
　　十分春色十分香，不屬東君與主張；
　　誰畫一枝同玩賞，夜來引月到紗窗。
　　嶠至晚歸家，其僕告曰：「適有一先生同杜官人來拜，不遇，其人題詩於梅軸而去。問其姓名，笑而不答。」嶠曰：「人物何如？」僕曰：「標格英偉，神氣異常，有清高絕俗之規模，風流慷慨之氣象。」嶠未解意，視其字跡，曰：「何人如此之狂妄也？」少頃，一價持柬而至，嶠開視之，乃道詩也：
　　世間會合總由天，千里攜琴訪少年；
　　寂寂山窗人不見，一堆黃卷帶牙籤。
　　嶠曰：「你相公來幾久矣？」價曰：「到此兩日矣。」嶠笑曰：「畫中之詩，諒必蘇兄所作也。」遂留價和詩，附答詩曰：
　　兩地睽違各一天，尋渭問息亦多年。
　　今朝正是相逢日，卻在人間弄酒簽。
　　價回，將書遞上。道見此詩，喜不自勝，風雲之志頓釋，花月之懷益增。
　　次日，嶠整衣來拜，兼具柬請。見道醉臥於花陰之下，不欲喚醒，乃題《醉花陰》詞一闋於壁間，投柬而去。詞曰：
　　「孤館沉沉愁永晝，無奈春寒透。時節欲黃昏，洗盞提壺，飲盡千杯酒。曲肱醉臥疏籬後，有梅花盈舞袖。夢裡暗生香，好個人來，試問君知否。？」
　　道醒，見此詞，認其字跡，知嶠所作。又檢視簡貼，恨不得與嶠相會。因作詩一首，遣價送與嶠云：
　　十分消瘦減春光，有恨難除覺夜長；
　　酒盞未傾心已醉，花陰高臥夢中香。
　　孰開竹戶迎仙客，誰掃苔階待玉郎；
　　去後始知君有意，漫題佳句在東牆。
　　嶠見詩，面僕擲地，曰：「我非有他意，蘇兄何誣人也。」僕回告知，道歎曰：「梧桐之拳拳，不足以至鳳凰之喈喈。」　
　　次早，嶠僕來催請，道托故不往。正納悶，見書軒之西有一幅畫鳳，遂題一絕於上曰：
　　幾回飛夢繞高岡，吹出秦樓夜月腔。
　　鳳鳥不來徒自悼，悲歌一曲斷人腸。
　　自此之後，嶠有不悅於道。請不來，約不至。道無如之何，將此情以告言，曰：「生托身門下，將及半月矣。所來實為令表弟故也。夫何向日來拜請，見生醉臥於花陰之下，乃題詩於壁間，投簡於几上面去？生醒來見詩並柬，自謂屬意於已，因作一律以戲之，復乃面僕擲詩於地曰：『何強誣人也！』後請而不來，事有參商。無可奈何，只得歸矣。」言止之曰：「公既為李子而來，今不見答而去，則後會難期，徒事遠勞也。況好事多磨，俗非謬語，人情反覆，理固有然，子何不察？不若暫延數日，待弟少暇，請他與公飲別，然後而歸，則今日赴合雖離，而後會之期可約。」道遵依，乃暫止焉。因調《醉東風》詞一闋：
　　「津渡難經歷，江山非咫尺。幾回無路可追尋，思思憶憶，今偶相逢，這番會面又無消息。低頭長歎唧，灑淚點胸襟，可憐好事竟參商。悶悶愁愁，風風雨雨，何時是得！」
　　越二日，不意道父遣價特來促歸。言及設筵，召嶠與道餞別。及至，禮畢，道曰：「賢弟如何無情？」嶠曰：「何以見之？」道曰：「向日遺書於子，而對價擲地，非寡情乎？」嶠曰：「焉敢如此。乃盛價誣言矣。」道知其掩飾，遂不與辯。三人暢飲。酒至半酣，言曰：「今日無可為樂，予表弟最善歌，請以作興，可乎？」道曰：「可。」嶠曰：「何詩可歌？」言曰：「《鹿鳴》、《南山》，不必歌也。賢弟可自制《阮郎歸》一曲，甚妙。嶠承命而歌曰：
　　「喜看行色又匆匆，傳杯莫放空。珍珠滴破小桃紅，明朝又復東。催去棹，速歸篷，梅花兩岸風。月明窗外與誰共？相思入夢中。」　　
　　道見詞清而圓，婉而亮，側耳之餘，塵氣盡掃，信奇才也。宴罷，道辭別。言具潮紗二匹，牙美人一座，嶠具色綾一端，廣葛一匹，徽扇四把。二人恭貢，道謙讓再三方收。臨舟之際，各有不忍舍之意。遂作一律並《如夢令》詞一闋以別嶠焉：
　　雙淚樽前別玉郎，東風何處送歸航；
　　月明篷底江風發，梅壓枝頭兩岸香。
　　密意卻從流水去，幽懷只望老天償；
　　來朝歸卻都城市，水遠山高幾斷腸！　　
　　又詞曰：
　　「托跡重門深處，引起春情愁緒。輕雲薄雨難成，佳會又為虛語。歸去，歸去，寂寞良宵虛度。」
　　嶠見道有眷戀之切，亦增感慨，遂吟五言一律以答焉：
　　銀燭吐青煙，金樽對綺筵，離堂思琴瑟，別路繞山川。明月隱高樹，長河沒曉天。悠悠岐路去，後會在何年？」　　
　　言見二人惆悵不已，亦作五言一律云：
　　相見楚天外，夢繞楚山吟；
　　更落淮南葉，難為兩地心。
　　衡陽問人遠，湘水向君深；
　　欲逐孤航去，茫茫何處尋！　　
　　三人留戀至晚而別。
　　道抵家，慰安父母，默歸書館。又見塵蒙几案，愈加鬱悶。終日惶惶，如有所失，經史無心，惟尋便與嶠相會。
　　一日，偶有趙州人來，道詢知，即附一詩與李嶠。其人回即送與嶠。嶠拆視之，不忍釋手。詩曰：
　　冬冷山頭樹拂雲，布衾難暖夢難成。
　　寂寥夜夜渾無伴，空有梅花襯月明。
　　既而，冬去春來，魚沉雁杳，又作一絕並《一剪梅》詞一闋，遣價送去與嶠。詩曰：
　　紅滿枝頭綠滿陂，惱人天氣正斯時；
　　尋花無奈香街遠，望柳多嫌煙逕迷。
　　密意難憑鶯燕訴，幽情誰許蝶蜂知；
　　何人為我傳消息，未贈黃金且贈詩。
　　詞曰：
　　「花有清香月有陰，花影重重，月影沉沉。相思無語只狂吟，愁也難禁，恨也難禁。-------欲托焦桐訴此情，未遇知音，難遇知音。何時密意共情深，金也同盟，石也同盟。」　　
　　嶠見僕至，甚喜，詢及相公起居安泰，遂拆封讀之。及知道心意甚堅，即和詩一律並絕句以附答云：
　　倚欄偷淚濕花枝，一日思君十二時；
　　輾轉竹牀春夢短，高燒銀燭夜眠遲。
　　心投金石人難識，意托焦桐我自如；
　　一段好懷無可訴，彩毫題就斷腸詩。
　　又絕句云：
　　花自舒紅柳自青，上林春色又妝成。
　　於今釀得真珠酒，來共花陰酌月明。
　　道見僕歸，拆開得此佳句，自謂陳雷之義可踵，鮑管之交可繼，奈山川　
　　阻隔，切切難合，鳥啼花語，每愁歲月之易邁；物換星移，又恐光陰之虛度，乃調《西江月》云：
　　「記得當初會唔，徒勞千里移琴。今朝遺我羽林音，卻是多情有分。----又值風柔寸重，何堪屐矮泥深。這回無路可追尋，只恐花飛散影。」
　　一日，有崔生者，名稱，字安成，亦居宦裔，與道甚契，來拜。款敘間，忽見壁上有《西江月》之詞，尋思良久，曰：「此詞固佳，似有閒情未遂之意。」道以實告之。融曰：「此奇遇也。何不圖之？」道曰：「心緒恍惚，無計可施。兄有高見，請以告我。融曰：「借言趙州師，此決就矣。」道得其言，大悅，設饣巽暢而別。
　　次早，告於父曰：「聞趙州出一名師，欲往求教，可乎？」父曰：「份所當然，何必告我。」道得言，益增欣慰。越二日，即整琴劍行裝，遣僕前往趙州。
　　及至，先拜杜審言，曰：「余離貴州，有名師，特來請教。」言答曰：「有。」道曰：「何姓何名？」言曰：「姓林，名子山，字汝重，其人精研五經而老於《春秋》，誠儒林中之翹楚者也。今於本州設館，從游七十徒，表弟亦在列焉。況兄又治《春秋》，從之豈無所益耶？但未知貴館在何處？」道答曰：「才到，未曾有定。」言曰「若然，吾有小軒，近在鄰間，僻靜，最堪尋繹，倘若不棄，可居於此。」道大悅，遂往居住。
　　越一日，嶠衣冠濟楚，來拜。各訴間闊之情。道此時不能自警，就挽摳求歡。嶠勃然變色。道曰：「子之言詞，何不相顧耶？」嶠曰：「何謂也？」道曰：「子前者遺書於我，一者心投金石，二者意托焦桐。今又如是，與詩大相背矣，非不顧而何？」嶠曰：「前詩聊以兄愁，豈有他哉！」道曰：「然則謂腸斷者，何事？」嶠含羞不答。眉黛交紅，即辭而去。自是不臨書館。
　　道無可奈何，朝暮長歎而已。言知覺，往視之，見其顏色清減，飲食俱廢，恐其成疾，乃謂曰：「兄謂擇師而來，夫何流連至今，亦已久矣，並不見施行，何也？況槐黃在即，當思際會風雲，以拾青紫，大事不圖而慕一少年以成疾，此非大丈夫之所為也，當速改之。」道聞言，愕然驚覺，汗流浹背，拱手謝曰：「兄乃金石之言也。」　
　　明早，備贄，往拜林子山為師。不意又見嶠搬移書篋行囊，在小軒居宿，接近道館。此時前懷復奮，愈加精神恍惚，思慕之心，又能禁耶！竊喜曰：「天意果從人願，今番不愁不諧矣。」　
　　隔日往拜，但見李嶠之情頓異，似無相識之意，前事全然不提。道悒怏而歸，復添懊悶。
　　明早，嶠來拜，見道擁衾而臥，未醒。嶠就牀而坐，檢几上文章朗誦。道俄然驚覺，見嶠坐於牀前，手足俱震，恍惚未定。少頃，方啟言曰：「賢弟來幾久矣？」嶠答曰：「半晌矣。」隨又執之求歡，嶠不從而去。再三呼之，不止。當此之時，心如刀剜，乃作一絕，遣價送去。詩曰：
　　幾回辜負阮郎來，怪殺桃花不肯開。
　　一種春心難頓放，百年情意可成　
　　嶠見詩，微哂。後二日，復來拜道，言曰：「昨承佳作，感荷良多。但白雪陽春，難為和耳。」道曰：「木桃瓊瑤，敢望報乎？」言語頗順。道乃進前。抱之求歡。正在猶豫之間，聞窗外足聲，遂釋，乃僕捧茶而至，竟然又別。道曰：「莫怨無情，但以少年不解世事。」亦不甚校，乃於壁間題詩一絕以自警：
　　十處尋芳九處空，花前泣雨灑東風。
　　不如收拾春心緒，頻對青燈一點紅。
　　時值春初，道以桃李為題，遂書一絕於先生館中壁上：
　　桃紅李白兩三枝，門牆初試未成時。
　　東君領得芬芳去，化作春風次第枝。
　　先生見詩，問：「是誰人而作？」諸子答曰：「蘇易道所作也。」先生歎曰：「學既淵源，貌亦卓雅。此子他日取青紫如拾草芥矣。」由是諸生咸敬重焉。而李嶠復加愛厚如初。時值講書之際，或以目視。或以言挑，彼此皆有顧盼之懷。
　　一日，先生設宴以待諸生。嶠含笑而言於道曰：「兄平日不多飲酒，今日有百杯之量耶？」道戲答之曰：「座上若有一點紅，斗筲之器飲千鍾。」道知嶠有復愛之意。次早，遣價送詩云：
　　柴門寂寞鎖松蘿，孤館無聊奈君何；
　　三月雨聲長不斷，一年好景竟如何。
　　不求故舊情懷好，空憶人龍想像多；
　　野鳥不知人意思，時窗外放聲歌聲。
　　嶠得此詩，歎曰：「蘇兄何不知音？君子以文會友，何重於此樂乎？遂和一律附答云：
　　春愁難解似藤蘿，仔細思量奈若何；
　　百歲心期還未馨，一年光景又空過。
　　游蜂戲採牽情重，浪蝶尋香苦恨多；
　　獨坐山空人寂寂，數聲啼鳥隔林歌。
　　嶠自和詩回答之後，一日步出館門，遇道經過，請人書室，對坐，曰：「尊兄為何久不下顧？」道曰「子絕我甚，來亦何補？」嶠曰：「未嘗有絕於兄也。」道曰：「余自遇賢弟之後，自謂可踵陳雷之後跡，管鮑之驥尾，故魂魄飛揚，心神搖蕩，雨泣風悲，猿啼鶴唳，無不牽情。懸以尋問求便，履險涉危。及至於斯，夫何屢次求見於子，而子屢見拒予，然弟之年少，不解世故。察子之言，又似無意於予也。今日偶然之遇，實為涉幸。倘若見憐，萬祈卸　一歡，則萬幸矣。」嶠含羞容答曰：「心孚意契，不必追究前愆。但容弟今夜有事，不敢奉命。待明日敬來伴兄同宿，以酬兄昔日之願，償弟前朝之失也。」袖中取出白綾畫帕一幅，付兄為定。道接帕，欣然起謝，曰：「果若如是，沒世不忘。」遂辭歸館。其心汲汲然欲今日之去，遑遑然望明月之來，乃調《踏沙行》詞一闋，以記其事云：
　　「子建雄才，潘安態度，樓台望斷無尋處。東風吹散柳條煙，桃源定此無迷路。密意難傳，幽情即訴，來朝正作孤鸞侶，月明孤館閉寒窗，海棠支上嬌鶯語。」
　　次早，嶠整衣冠赴約。忽值母舅至，嶠歎曰：「乃天也，」不得己，陪侍之至更深，而不能去焉。道館中預設佳餚，褥鋪錦被，鳳燭高燃，麝沉滿　，拂焦桐於案几，懸古軸於軒轅，候至更深，並無蹤影，疑其誣言，悵恨而睡，次日，作詩一首，遣價送去：
　　期來何不下山齋，事恐參商意亦乖；
　　半榻塵埃空掃盡，一庭樽酒懶安排。
　　簾捲東風常盼望，推窗明月滿愁懷；
　　當初不若無相識，思意何從眼下來？　　
　　嶠得此詩，歎曰：「吾心雖堅，彼所不知。」謹具小啟，附價以復云：
　　「弟昨日兄有邂逅之期，自謂千種之懷可遂，一朝之失盡償。故也，時整衣而行，不期母舅突至，以致事勢睽違。如此，身雖在家，而神馳左右。但事既失約，負愧特甚。然好事多磨，理固然也，亦皆天也，豈獨兄與弟乎！」今再擇便，謹伸前約，決不敢爽。草草奏覆，惟亮，幸甚！」
　　道得此啟，心緒稍安。又有「今日再伸前約」之語，強顏數日，乃得會於館中，道正挽之懷抱，略有半推半就之意，忽被眾友來扣館扉，遽然阻散。道不覺汗盈腮面。嶠察其意，恐貽其患，歸而調《滿庭芳》一闋，使人送去，以寬慰之：
　　「楊柳堆煙，梨花飛雪，閒庭畔減春光。愁愁悶悶，無奈日偏長。記得約言難踐，成又敗，畢竟參商。且忍耐，終須與你，交頸兩鴛鴦。想是斷腸寸寸，流淚雙雙。怕風生絳帳，雨灑窗櫺，只恐佳期未定，早歸去，花謝鶯愁。情難表，試將禿筆，調個《滿庭芳》。」　　
　　又詩一絕云：
　　綠樹陰濃日影遲，錦堂春晚亂花飛。
　　倉庚有意回人語，百舌無端繞樹啼。
　　道得此詩而仇恨漸消，亦作《滿庭芳》云：
　　「風掃殘紅，雨添新綠，深深庭院月偏幽。晝長人困，無計而消愁。記得昨宵春曉，小窗內，情話綢繆。哪知道，狂蜂浪蝶，窺覘我風流。使百般間阻，語語言言，合下冤仇。一場好事，從此休休。只恐時光虛度，年華老，日月難留，無可奈，但憑尺素，道此因由。」
　　又又詩一絕云：
　　銀燈挑盡夜遲遲，高捲珠簾半掩扉。
　　久待知音人不到，月明驚起杜鵑啼。
　　自後嶠未伸前約，漸漸生疏。道盼想日切，失意殊深，悒悒成病，數日不能起，飲食俱廢，精神恍惚。其僕忙報嶠曰：「吾大叔病重，數日不能起。客館消然，不能醫治，如之奈何！」嶠大驚，即往視之。道見嶠至，強起，執手曰：「我被你送了命矣！」俄然而昏絕。嶠恐懼，呼之再三，乃蘇。嶠泣曰：「兄何不自保重貴體也。兄若為我損身，弟決不能獨存。」反覆詢慰，請醫調治。越十餘日，方愈。
　　道取藍綠絹二匹，雲履一雙，僕齎隨，親往謝焉。嶠趨迎。見道精神復原，大喜，即延入西軒，厚款。道乃遞上菲儀。嶠曰：「得兄貴體痊安，實為欣幸，何敢領此佳賜？」辭讓再三，方受。道再拜曰：「命在須臾，多感扶持之力，荷恩不淺。」嶠答曰「今日乃知兄之心堅矣。」道歎曰：「徒知亦無益矣。」嶠曰：「兄貴體新痊，往來頗繁，倘或不允，草榻一宵，何如？」道欣然從之。是夜，盛設香醪美饌，二人暢飲。更深，道托醉求寢。嶠呼僕陪道入同宿，道趨前抱挽而言曰：「今夜若不如願，則前病復作，命必殂矣。」嶠笑而答曰：「吾試兄之心耳，豈有同宿之理耶？」於是嶠挽道出軒，二人對天祝曰：「李嶠生居人世，年庚一十六歲。今以心孚意契於欒城縣蘇生名易道者，共結二姓金蘭，生死不忘，存沒如一，無負斯心，永終無　。敢有違盟，天神鑒誅。」祝罷就寢。嶠謂道曰：「予年尚幼，漠然不知，兄當見憐，沽恩厚矣。」道曰：「無瑕之白壁，世所罕稀，今得就之，敢不盡心愛護。」此時情到興濃恨不得兩身合為一體也。道曰：「吾百計千端，憂思萬種，今始有遂惟萬且一。既承雅清，追思昔者，不知賢弟堅執之甚，果何謂也？」嶠曰：「相思之苦，彼此皆然，但未敢輕視矣。情合之後，願成終始，恩愛相關，綿綿不昧，勿以他日有花落色殘之歎。」道曰：「感荷再生之恩豈敢忘耶？」犬馬之報，一息常存，固可結而不可解也。雖海枯石爛，心不可易，志不可移，金石何足言哉！」次早，作詩一絕以謝嶠云。道曰：
　　昨宵曾記宿花房，燈燼長檠月滿牀。
　　自恨晨雞三唱曉，醒來猶帶夢魂香。
　　嶠亦調《一剪梅》以答之：
　　神氣標奇入眼中，好個人龍，真個人龍，佳期蜜約已心也難同，志也難同，愁未冰消恨未窮，愁鎖眉峰，恨鎖眉峰。昨宵花蝶兩相逢，花領春風，蝶領春風。」
　　自是二人心意相孚，深篤金蘭之利，事情浹洽，不啻芝蘭之美。信乎如膠似漆，若魚水之相投，未足以方其密也。日測談笑歌樂，夜則交頸而臥。又不覺物換星移，西風近起，新秋至矣。
　　道父染病，價持家書促歸甚急。道與嶠曰：「歡會未幾，離愁又至，奈何！奈何！」嶠曰：「何事？」道乃出其家書以示之。嶠曰：「令尊既在疾，兄宜當速歸，切勿憂思，有傷貴體。想天不違人願，暫別而已，後會固可期焉。」　
　　次早，拜辭。言因往莊，未及送行。嶠備京段二匹，雲履一雙，又設席江邊餞別。道見禮物精厚，不敢遽受，嶠強之再三，乃收。二人挽手，不忍相離，留戀不捨，延至日暮，方能別去。時月朗風清，嶠佇立，望舟不見，惆悵而返。因作一絕以紀之云：　月滿江頭一派秋，羅衫輕拂上蘭舟。
　　孤航遠影知何在，只有長江空自流。
　　嶠自別道之後，朝夕企想，頃刻未嘗有忘於懷。
　　道既歸家，其父病不數日即愈。道呼天大喜曰：「天意不違人願，誠哉是言也。」遂修書一封，並詞一闋，遣價送去。書曰：
　　「荷愛生蘇易道頓首拜啟即殿元李巨山賢契門下：伏自江邊一別，倏爾旬餘。燈前之約雖堅，花下之盟未整。刻諸心，鏤諸骨，夢寢常形；念在茲，釋在茲，瞑目如見。敬陳尺楮，聊托微衷。伏惟賢弟學貫天人，才高一世之英偉；貌逞奇威，丰姿毓天台之秀麗。誠文苑翰英，士林翹楚者也。生自謂孤立無朋，不意賢弟之見愛，得托身於玉樹之傍，雖粉身莫能酬其厚德。是以意氣相投，翼乎如鴻毛之遇順風；肝膽相照，浠乎如巨魚之縱大海。歡會未幾，離愁雜至，蓋由高堂有採薪之憂故矣。千愁萬憶，自謂後會難期，詎知人有欲而天意果從，椿樹放榮，喜生眉角，佳期又指日而定矣。伏願青雲自勵，丹桂興思，又效彩鳳孤棲，無移心志，奇葩欲噴，不憧憧以朋從，則道也生順死安，無復遺恨矣。幽懷萬縷，歡愁即至，故不覺其言之已贅。惟心亮照，不宣。外具潞州綢一匹，乃借桃寄意，伏祈笑留。幸甚。」　
　　又詞曰：
　　「深沉密約，在花下為盟，許諾同心，不想天辜人願也。便幾番虛設，彩鳳分群，文鸞拆侶，此恨何時滅！」覆雨翻雲，好把相思細說。」
　　嶠得此書，不覺手舞足蹈，喜不自勝。將所遺潞州綢收入。修書一封，並《鳳凰台上憶吹簫》詞一闋及禮附人回答。書曰：
　　「辱愛弟李嶠頓首拜書覆大國柱蘇兄子游台座前：切惟人倫有五，友居其一；人性有五，信寓其中。是以人而無朋則孤陋寡聞，朋而無信則無益而有損。昔人有聞：一介之士，必有腹心，非謂是歟？然契兄胸涵萬頃，筆掃雲煙，誠間氣之所鍾，為當時之碩望也。嶠接之始，遂興山鬥之思，既而不厭瓦礫，切蒙雅愛之厚，捫心有愧，揣分奚堪！自謂千載奇逢，喜是情堅膠漆，夫何事關意外，遂成形孑影孤。頓使淒楚情懷，每感於衾枕；企仰憶念，恒不離起居，凴欄倚遍，實懊恨乎晝永，仍輾轉反側，則又苦恨乎更長。正把柔腸萬轉，忽驚雲翰飛來。踴躍承領，細嚼佳音，足知金石之心，而平生之願遂矣。茲者，預設陳蕃之榻，早望鶴駕來臨，則倚玉有緣，斷金不爽，何幸如之！書難盡敘，並有鄙詞二闋錄呈。外具沉香線絹二匹，祈盼物想心，笑留，幸感！倘暇，乞移玉駕光臨，至望！」　　
　　又詞曰：
　　「海煙消，江月皎，楊柳頭難留歸棹。三疊陽光聲漸杳，別離知道何時了？愁處多，歡處少，獨倚孤樓，怕雨鳴池沼。窗外深沉人悄悄，落花滿地空啼鳥。」　　
　　又詞曰：
　　「雨浦花黃，西廂月暗，檀郎獨上輕舟，任翠亭塵滿，深院閒幽。每怕梧桐細雨，碎滴滴，驚起多愁，身消瘦，非乾酒，不是傷愁。恨衝衝何時盡了，方下眉頭，又上心頭，念雲收霧掃，」莫倚危樓。長記深盟厚，何時整百歲綢繆，如魚水之交歡，金石相投。」　　
　　道得詞並絹。次早，稟於父母，仍帶僕復往趙州。薄暮，乃至。
　　嬌聞道至，欣然往拜。道邀入書館中，對坐敘久，道曰：「兩情間闊，溫故可知。」嶠戲答之曰：「溫故可當知新乎？」道疑其言，曰：「故雖未溫，而子又知新乎？」嬌曰「兄何出此言也？弟自別兄之後，諸事無心，惟兄是念，並無他故，今兄乃有如是之言，使弟失計甚矣。」道曰：「予豈不知賢弟之堅心乎！前言戲之耳。」嶠曰：「幽王相戲，使國有失。豈不知弟患，夫何足戲之？」道遂挽嶠求歡。雲合之際，嶠乃推避逡巡。道曰：「吾弟已慣，今何若是耶？」嶠曰：「向日見慣，因兄久別，遂復生疏。」道曰：「姑且試之，庶幾又美。」　
　　由是道與嶠日則同窗，夜則共枕，或並肩於月下，或合脛於羅幃，曲盡人間之樂，無以加矣。是夜，言造拜，道遂整饌暢飲。言醉，擁衾就寢。嶠見表兄在彼，即別道回家。
　　一日，道有表弟陳子京，亦少俊之士，因往趙州公幹，寄宿道館三日，然後啟行。彼初到之日，嶠偶潛入，聞館中有喧嘩之聲，偷窺之，見道與少年內坐，嶠疑之而歸。是夜，遣價問道借琴，探其動靜。價返，答曰：「蘇相公與一少年正欲就寢矣。」嶠曰：「別有人否？」價曰：「無他。」嶠又問曰：「別有言否？」價曰：「無片言。」嶠見價言，痛心切恨。次日，又使人去請道講書，又不見至。嶠愈加怨恨。由是視道如仇人，凡相會，不與一語。而道問之，亦不答，使價請之，不來。道不知其故，乃吟《憶秦娥》詞一闋，遣人送去，以察其意若何：
　　「秋寂寞，夢闌酒後相思著。玉顏花貌，風流閒卻。南來北燕沙頭落，幽情密意誰傳托？愁腸欲斷，飲杯孤酌。」
　　嶠見詞，即扯破而言曰：「何污吾目也？」價歸報，道茫然自失，不知何意為懷，次日，親往拜探，以問其故。但聞嶠在內高聲而言曰：「失信無義之人，復來何故？」道漸愧回館，悶憶殊深，不知其詳。
　　一日，偶出，見嶠經過，強邀入館，問曰：「弟何背言也？」嶠不答。道又問曰：「弟何怨我之深耶？」嶠忿容曰：「厭常喜新，世人常情，余敢怨兄耶！惟刺痛愚衷矣！」道驚曰：「我無他事，子何誣人？」嶠曰：「目擊耳聞，非誣也。」道曰：「為我白之。」嶠不答，惟長吁而已。道曰：「弟若不明言，生死在頃刻矣。」嶠曰：「兄無怒。」道曰：「死且不避，奚敢怒焉！」嶠曰：「弟遇兄後，誓同生死，永結綢繆。不意交歡未久，而兄又棄舊迎新。」道曰「何以見之？」嶠曰：「前者因表兄醉臥兄館，弟暫回宿，事絆未臨，昔者，偶來兄館，窺見兄與一少年同坐，遂潛而退。至夜，又遣價借琴，實以觀兄動靜，又見兄與同寢。次早，又使人來請講書，又不見至。是兄棄我特甚，而弟最負盟乎？道聞言，笑曰：「子誤矣，前日所遇年少者，乃母舅之子，我之表弟也。因來公幹，寄宿生館，並無一毫私意。弟若不信，予將几上飾玉杯擲地為誓曰『道若有私心，身如物碎』。」嶠乃笑而挽之曰：「事跡可疑，人心難信，兄有別遇，弟實傷懷。望兄擴天地之量。勿以前非為恨，幸矣。」道曰：「得我賢弟回心，實為獲珍之喜，敢抱怨乎？」乃調一詞以敘情曰：
　　「枕畔才喜相投，如何又別？寸腸欲裂。百計千愁無處訴，今喜故人重接。滿酌霞觴，長歌皎月。與你共歡娛，海誓山盟，大地齊休歇。」
　　自是，二人信其心而不疑其跡，凡有事必先議而後行。言則同心，事則同志，平居閒暇，勤習經史，然形骸雖隔，渾乎一氣之貫通，而私愛之密，浹於肌膚，淪於骨髓，信若鳥之鴛鴦，枝之連理也。
　　厥後蘇易道、李嶠、杜審言、崔融四人，結為文學四友，同入鄉試。道得占魁，抵京聯捷，授咸陽尉。即差人抵家，及臨趙州，來接李嶠三友，修書問候。嶠因鄉試未就，憂悶殊甚，父母代伊求婚，卻之不已。時聞價報：「蘇老爺任上差人來此。」嶠喚人，接書開讀：
　　「辱愛生蘇易道頓首再拜大殿元巨山李契弟台左：自別顏范，夙經載餘，朝夕企想，但覺晝長夜永，倦理於正事，惟懷攜手並肩。今者，忝居是任，實出於賢弟之教誨也，但身居彼地，而神馳左右。今者，特差人來接駕，萬祈追念燈前月下、意契心孚、稟達尊翁，尊堂，治裝秣馬，遙駕光臨，生當懸榻預待，倘或見卻，生即洗肘掛印，棄職而歸，決不爽郎盼想。臨書之際，已曾淚染雲箋，尚檢污痕可驗也。萬惟心照賜臨，幸甚！　
　　道再頓首。」　　
　　嶠見來意慇懃，甚喜。即稟父母，便擇日同差人趕程。越二日方至。
　　嶠嫩質未經遠涉，陡覺體倦，暫停行旆，寓宿於陳鄉宦宅傍。閒敘之際，店主道曰：「此一派第宅，俱是陳茂春老爺轉賃者。亦曾居南京戶部尚書之職，但無男嗣，懶於任政，致仕歸家。惟有一女，名喚玉英，年登二八，詩詞歌賦，無不精通，父母珍惜，如執玉捧盈也。」　不期次早茂春送客出門，嶠趨視之。春得睹其英容異俗，盼其豐采拔塵，即遣僕詢其居址。僕回答曰：「此大叔乃趙州李岳老爺之子，名嶠，因往蘇老爺任，經此暫歇，少舒勞頓。」春聞言，即盛設筵，遣僕來請。嶠愕然不知其故，又不敢遽卻，只得強而赴之。
　　春下階迎接，禮貌甚恭。嶠驚竦不已，不敢居上，惟隅坐東焉。春曰：「令尊大人與下官仕途相會，甚為知愛，不意今日得會足下，實萬幸也。」嶠方知來歷，遂放懷款敘。至暮，辭別。春曰：「今日天付奇逢，尚容止數日，方肯與子行矣。」即遣僕搬移行裝，收拾池館一所，玩器兼備，更深延入寢所，命二小童伏侍。
　　春入內與夫人言曰：「吾觀李子有絕世之姿，奪標之志，異日變化，與吾職可並也。若得此子為婿，良願足矣。」夫人亦大悅。
　　春遂默修書，遣僕竟投趙州，來見李公，獨言親事。岳接書視之，乃知陳茂春將女許嶠，同夫人趙氏大喜，即備表裡二端，金鈿一對，權為定儀。囑僕曰：「汝大叔往咸陽蘇老爺任也，回家即送聘卜娶。」僕回，將書並禮遞上，春大悅。
　　越日，差人催促起行。嶠登堂告別。春曰：「倘容一日，再伸款待，方慰愚懷。」嶠從之。回館吟一律以懷道曰：
　　蕭條愁兩地，獨院隔同群；
　　一夜原為家，多旬不見君。
　　馳心如白日，牽意若歸雲；
　　更在相思處，規聲徹夜聞。
　　嶠詠畢，無聊，縱步池畔觀蓮，見錦鱗逐對，戲濯浮沉。轉眼間，俄見飲秋亭畔太湖石傍有美女，鈕環緩步摘花，有沉魚落雁之容，閉月羞花之貌，恍若天姬臨世，渾如月姊離宮。金蓮動處，湧起千嬌；寶髻雲欹，涵生百媚。嶠見之，不覺魂飛魄散，不知天耶？人耶？趨前恭揖。其女避之不及，遂和顏斂衽答禮，不能一談，斂跡而去。嶠回館中，切慕之極，料是無緣再會，聊占一絕書壁以記焉：
　　玉貌新妝束，雲鬟若點鴉；
　　顧影鸞朝鏡，回盼燕蹴花。
　　天姬愁入俗，月姊笑離槎；
　　珍重輕盈態，黃金不憚誇。
　　玉英自避生歸房之後，想：「是何人得至池畔遊戲？觀其英容，雖潘安不能逾也。但寸草雖未沾春，而鳳情世態，必然盡識矣。」自此，針刺之功頓釋，而仰慕之思益增。」若得斯人成匹，雖死亦無遺憾矣。」遂口占一律以自遣焉：
　　一會文君想我懷，胸中愁緒向誰開；
　　題橋不亞相如志，作賦應高子建才。
　　羅幃繡幕重重閉，春色緣何人得來；
　　假饒不遂于飛願，一點芳心肯作灰！　　
　　二人俱不知父母之意，驀地相逢，各懷企仰。
　　次日，嶠登堂拜別。春具白金五十兩為贐。仍設大宴，請夫人之弟來陪。嶠不知其意，只得赴席，見其恭敬親厚，愧赧無地。酒至半，舅乃言曰：「公今日是吾家甥婿也。令尊已行定彩矣。」嶠方知其故，心中稍安。款敘至暮，筵散回館，暗自喜曰：「若是前遇之女，誠天賜也。」　
　　黎明告別，春致餞，乃祝曰：「秋闈逼近，可速回應試。」嶠致恭領，拜別。
　　直抵咸陽。把門人報知，道整冠趨出迎接。延入內衙，慰問勞頓，並詢家屬。遂設盛筵暢飲。更深就寢，仍效昔日于飛之樂，其情愈加綢密。嶠將陳茂春親事述知，道稱賀至極。
　　次日，行一切政務，先請問於嶠，然後施行。故一時政教號令，悉合民心，功績大著，皆嶠之力也。
　　時道報升北京鳳闕舍人，即欲臨任。嶠告歸赴試，道不敢留，謹具白金百兩，又表裡等物，差人護送，致酒餞別，遂作五言絕詩一首，以懷歉云：
　　君登片航去，我望青山歸。
　　雲山從此隔，淚透紫羅衣。
　　嶠曰：「不為功名之念，決不敢別於仁兄矣。但期浪暖，必然重整焉遂作五言律一首以慰焉：
　　相思春樹綠，千里各依依；
　　才得月輪滿，如何又帶虧？　
　　桂花香不落，煙草蝶只飛；
　　一別違消息，桃源浪暖期。
　　嶠別道抵家，將陳茂春親事備述於父母。父曰：「良緣奇遇，門戶相當，真可尚也。你能奪標歸娶，方能稱志。」　
　　及時值槐黃桂噴，嶠與表兄杜審言、契友崔融三人人試。嶠得占魁，二人居於榜列。是時同赴京都。道接見，喜極，列筵，暢飲達旦。
　　嶠榮擢探花，欽賜遊街。時烏紗冠頂，金帶懸腰，更兼顏華色麗，真飄飄焉當世之神仙。而同僚見者，無不切慕。除授廬州別駕。擢進士，授溫城尉。融擢進士，授袁州刺史。道設宴於會館餞別。盼想當時俱以布衣相契，今者俱受天恩寵命，誠為文學四友可也。
　　厥後蘇易道以文翰顯時，至正元年，官拜天官，娶夫人韋氏，生三子一女。李嶠以文詞名世，官拜尚書，娶夫人陳氏，生二男，娶道之女為婦。杜審言恃才高傲，貶後仍拜修文館學士，娶夫人蔡氏，生四子。崔融以詩賦鳴時，官拜崇文館學士，為太子侍讀，娶夫人高氏，生四子，仍擢及第。此四友俱得榮超，永垂後世。而心相孚，而德所敬，實為罕見。蓋因忠信誠實，而著為後之龜鑒。
　　東郭集　
　　趙簡了大獵於山中。虞人導前，嬖奚驂右，捷禽鷙獸應弦倒者，不可勝數。有狼當道，人立而啼。簡子怒，唾手奮髯，援烏號之弓，挾肅氏之矢，一發飲羽，狼失聲而逋。簡子怒，驅車逐之。輕塵蔽天，十步之外，不辯人馬。
　　時墨者東郭先生，將北適中山以干仕，策蹇驢，囊圖書，宿行失道，卒然值之，惶不及避。狼顧而人言曰：「先生豈相厄哉！昔隋侯救蛇虯獲珠，蛇固弗靈於狼也。今日之事，何不使我得早處囊內，以延殘喘？異時脫穎而出，先生之恩大矣，敢不努力以效隋侯之蛇。」先生曰：「嘻！私汝狼以犯趙孟，禍且不測，敢望報乎！然墨者之道，兼愛為本，吾固當有以活汝也。」遂出圖書，空囊橐，徐實狼其中；三內之而未克，徘徊躊躇，追者益近。狼請曰：「事急矣，惟先生早圖！」乃 其四足，索繩子先生束縛之；下首至尾，曲脊　胡，蝟縮蠖屈，蛇盤龜息以退。命先生，先生如其指。人狼於囊，遂括囊口，肩舉驢上，引避道左，以待趙人之過。
　　已而簡子至，求狼弗得，不勝其怒，拔劍折轅端示先生，罵曰：「故諱狼方向者，有如此轅！」先生伏質就地，匍匐以進，跪而言曰：「鄙人不慧，將有志於世，奔走四方，實迷其途，又安能指迷於夫子也？然聞之大道以多歧亡羊。夫羊，一童子可制，尚以多歧而亡。今狼非羊比也，況中山之歧，可以亡狼者何限！乃區區循大道以求之，下幾於守株緣木者乎！況田獵，虞人之所有事也。今茲之失，請君問諸皮冠，行道之人何罪哉！且鄙人雖愚，亦熟知夫狼矣，性貪而狼，助豹為虐，君能除之，固當窺左足以效微勞也，又安敢諱匿其蹤跡哉！」簡子默然，回車就道，先生亦驅驢兼程而進。
　　良久，羽旄之影漸沒，車馬之音不聞，狼度簡子之去已遠，乃作聲囊中曰：「先生可以留意
　　矣。願先生出我囊，解我縛，我氣不舒，我將逝矣。」先生舉手出狼。狼出，咆哮，望先生曰：「適為趙人逐，其來甚遠。雖感先生生我，然饑餓實甚，使不食，亦終必亡而已矣。與其餓死道路為烏鳶啄食，毋寧死於虞人之手以俎豆趙孟之堂也。先生既墨者，摩頂放踵利天下為之，又何吝一軀不以啖我而活此微命乎？」遂鼓吻奮爪以向先生。先生倉卒以手搏之，且搏且卻，擁蔽驢後。狼逐之，便旋而走。自朝至於日昃，狼終不能有加於先生。先生亦極力為之拒，遂至俱倦，隔驢喘息。先生曰「狼負我！狼負我！」狼曰：「吾不得食汝不止！」相持既久，日將盡矣，先生心口私語曰：「天色已暮，狼若群至，吾必死矣。」乃紿狼曰：「民俗，為疑必詢三老。且行，以求三老而執之，苟謂我當食，我死且無憾。」狼大喜，即與偕行。
　　此時道無行人，狼饞甚，望見老樹僵立路傍，乃謂先生曰：「可問是老。」先生曰：「草木無知，叩焉何益？」狼曰：「但問之，復當為汝言矣。」先生不得已，揖老樹，且述其始末。問曰：「狼當食我耶？」樹中忽然有聲如人，謂先生曰：「是當食汝！且我，杏也。昔年老圃種我，不過費一核耳。逾年而華，再逾年而實，三年拱把，十年合抱，於今三十年矣。老圃，我食之；老圃之妻，我亦食之；外至賓客，下至農僕，我食之，又時復鬻我實於市以規利，其有德於老圃甚厚矣。今老矣，不能斂華就食，老圃怒，伐我枚條，芟我枝葉，且將售我工師而取值焉。噫！以樗朽之枝，當桑榆之景，求免於主人斧鉞之誅而不可得！汝何德於狼，乃覬倖免乎？」言下狼鼓吻奮爪以向先生。先生曰：「狼爽盟矣。矢詢三老，今值其一老，遽見食耶？」　
　　復與偕行。狼復饞甚，望見老牛孛曝日敗垣中，謂先生曰：「可問是老。」先生曰：「向者草木無知，謬言害事。今牛，又獸耳，更何問焉？」狼曰：「第問之，如其不問，將口至汝矣。」先生不得已，揖老牛孛，仍述其始末。問曰：「狼當食我耶？」牛皺眉瞠目，低鼻張口，向先生作人言，曰：「是當食汝！我頭角幼時，筋力頗健，老農鍾愛我，使二群牛從事於南畝。既壯，群牛日以老憊，我都其事。老農出，我駕車先驅，老農耕，我引犁效力。斯時也，我農視我如左右手，一歲中，衣食仰我而給，婚姻仰我而畢，賦稅仰我而輸。今欺我老弱，逐我於野，酸風射眸，寒陽弔影，瘦骨如山，垂淚如雨，涎流而不能收，步艱而不能舉，皮骨俱亡，瘡痍未瘥。邇聞老農將不利於我，其妻復妒，又朝夕進說其夫，曰：『牛之一身，無棄物也。其肉可脯，及皮與骨角，可切磋為器。』指大兒曰：『汝受業庖丁之門有年矣，何不礪刃於硎以待乎？』跡是觀之，我不知死所矣！然我有功於老農，如是其大且久，尚將嫁禍而不為我德矣，汝有何德於狼，乃凱倖免乎？」言下狼又鼓吻奮爪以向先生。先生曰：「無欲速。」　
　　遙望有一老子，杖藜而來，眉髮皓然，衣冠閒雅，舉步從容。先生自謂曰：「此必有道之人也。」且喜且愕，忙然舍狼而前，拜跪泣訴，曰：「我有救狼之德矣，今反欲食我，乞丈人一言而生。」丈人問救狼人故，先生曰：「是狼為趙人窘，幾死，求救於我，我即傾囊而匿之於內，是我生之也。今反不以我為德，而反欲口至我，我力求救，彼必不免，是以誓決三老。初逢老樹，強我問之。我答曰：『草木無知，問之無益。』強我數四而問焉，殊料草木亦言食我。次逢老牛孛，強我問之。我亦無奈，遂問，那禽獸無知，又幾殺我。今逢老丈，是天未喪斯文也。願賜一言而生我。」因頓首杖下，俯伏聽命。丈人聞言，吁嗟再三，以杖扣狼脛，厲聲曰：「汝誤矣。夫人有恩而背之，不祥莫大焉。汝速去，不然，將杖殺汝。」狼艴然不悅，曰：「丈人知其一，未知其二。初，先生救我，束縛我足，閉我囊中，我　不敢息。又蔓詞說簡子，語剌剌不能休。且詆毀我，其意蓋將死我於囊中，獨竊其利也。是安得不口至？」丈人顧先生而謂曰：「公果如是？是亦有罪焉。」先生不平，盡道其救狼之意，狼亦巧言不已，而爭辯於丈人之前以求勝也。
　　丈人曰：「是皆不足信也。」謂狼曰：「汝仍匿於囊中，我試觀其狀，果若困苦如前否？」狼欣然從之。先生囊縛如前。而狼未之知也。丈人附耳謂先生曰：「有匕首否？」先生曰：「有。」於是出匕焉。丈人曰：「先生使強匕摘其狼！」先生猶豫未忍。丈人撫掌笑曰：「禽獸負恩如是，而猶不忍殺之，子則仁矣，其如愚何！」遂舉手助先生操刃共殪狼棄道而去。
　　由是觀之，其為人也，而不能以報恩者，是亦狼矣。何以人而不如狼乎？
　　筆辯論　
　　班超歸自西域，止於洛陽，閉門養疾，無所逢迎。有一儒生，銳首而長身，款扉投謁，自稱故人。門者辭曰：「君侯久勞於外，精神消亡，不樂於應接，雖公卿大夫，猶不得望見顏色，安問故人！」生聞之，黧然變色，毛髮竦豎，排門而入，即謂超曰：「子當壯年，激功速利，馳志異域，棄我如屣，跨躍風雲，一息萬里，子固絕我矣，而我與子未嘗絕也。凡子之建功名、享爵位、耀於今而垂於後者，我與有勞焉。子不德我，乃待我以不見乎？」　
　　超聞之，瞿然而視，且怒且疑，與之坐而問之：「子欺我哉！逢掖之士，淹寂窮廬，游詠術藝，呻吟典謨，研朱漬墨，占畢操觚，自厭百家，腕脫大書；若史遷發憤於紀傳，伏生皓首於遺經，董子下帷而講授，劉向閉門而研精，相如托諷於詞賦，揚雄覃思於《法言》，彼皆收功於既死之際，成名於隔世之間，樂為迂闊，往而不反，故汝得以揚眉吐穎，含毫銳思，或逞才以效能，或，扌離藻而綺靡，寫幽思於尺素，垂空言於百世，雖聖智之有餘，諒非爾而菲濟，僕誠不與吾子立，故逃爾而遠逝。於是要　具之劍，擁豐特之旄，左執鞭弭，右屬革建橐，射泓玄之流，招劇季之豪，望蒲類而北向，逾流沙而西涉，嗚鐸伊吾之野，飲馬長城之窟，羈名王子轡組，膏猶豪於鐵鉞，橫四校於龍堆，出九死於虎穴。但見千車雲屯，萬騎雲合，矢如彗流，戈如雷逝，紛紛紜紜，天動地趿，智者為之愚，勇者為之怯。設於是時，固已銷鋒劍跡，顛倒筐筐，聞鉦鼓而迫遁，望羽檄而膽　，又豈能出一奇、畫一乩，以相及哉？夫名不可以虛得，功不可以幸取，勞之未圖，報於何有？」　
　　生乃卓然起立，進而言曰：「吾聞大功無形，大利難名，仁人垂德於上報，志士弛榮而不爭。凡我之功，遠者、大者、人所共知，不待緬縷，近在子身，何獨未喻？子游京師，困於逆旅，與我傭書，來其官府，握手終日，未嘗厭汝。工汝字書，順汝批使，成汝文章，通汝志意。仰事俯畜，皆我是賴。及為令使，掌書蘭台。晨入暮出，必與汝偕，言無汝違，行無汝乖。夫何一旦絕已固之交，結無信之友，壞可成之功，造難就之計；舍聖賢這業，操不祥之器，乘機蹈危，以徼一時之富貴？然我猶圖封官之勛，忍投地之恥，將全汝交，未即背棄。若乃戎車竟野，伏鉞瞻師，文告之修，我記汝詞。虎符尺籍，有所征發，我傳汝信，應期而合。或移書而安文，或安屯而數實，或計功於幕府，或通信於鄰國，凡此多端，匪我弗克。汝在於墨，上書乞兵，我寫汝心，卒獲所請。汝厭西上，情懷百首，泣血騰章，實我所摹。汝姊陳詞，悲歎激切，感動天子，實我所書。既而，還旅窮荒，懸車帝裡，微我之惠，何以及此？雖然，此特其小小者耳。其夫鋪張鴻休，潤色弘烈，書之施常，列之簡冊，使汝得以流芳聲、騰茂實，光明融顯，千載而不滅者，春功豈易易哉？今子徒欲誇淺近之效，忘本原之義，是何異於始皇之疏杰，而平原之木遂也！」　
　　超乃盱睚失容，意若有避。生曰：「未也。願安汝聽，少窮我臆。昔汝先君，間關抵蜀，我在童髦，資其簡牘。逮汝兄固，父書自續，念我前功，復見汝錄。我乃竭其管見，投以寸心，道葉膠漆，利同斷金。相其成書，蔚為詞林。向使固不亙其德，背好忘故，改行易業，效尤於汝，則孰為之綴詞，秉翰以成其製作哉？且夫萬里封侯，立功異域，榮則榮矣，孰與夫論道屬書，為世儒宗，以間父之績？薄伐西戎，恢我疆士，忠則忠矣，孰與夫繼代作史，勒成一家，以佐漢之光？向使戎敵之人，或神巫之言，悼斬使之恥，獸心坌躍，狙許焱起，吾將見汝膏身縣度之墟，暴骨棄之於野，生為囚俘，死為夷鬼，又安敢望青紫乎？故子常鄙我而不用，我亦笑子身勤而事左，勞大而功細也。
　　超聞期言，亻免首流汗，揖客門外，自愧不學，卒以漸死。
　　虯鬚叟傳　
　　呂用之在維揚日，佐渤海王擅政害人。中和四年秋，有商人劉損，挈家乘巨船自江夏至揚州。用之凡遇公私來，悉令偵覘行止。劉妻裴氏，有國色。用之以陰事下劉獄，納裴氏。劉獻金百兩免罪，雖脫非橫，然亦憤惋，因成詩三首曰：
　　其一　
　　寶釵分股合無緣，魚在深淵日在天；
　　得意紫鸞休舞鏡，斷蹤青鳥罷銜箋。
　　金杯倒覆難收水，玉軫傾剞懶續弦；
　　從此蘼蕪山下過，只應將淚比黃泉。
　　其二　
　　鸞辭舊伴知何止，鳳得新梧想稱心；
　　紅粉尚存香幕幕，白雲將散信沉沉。
　　已休靡琢投泥玉，懶更經營買笑金；
　　願作山頭似人石，丈夫衣上淚痕深。
　　其三　
　　舊嘗游處偏尋看，睹物傷情死一般；
　　買笑樓前花已謝，畫眉窗下月空殘。
　　雲歸巫峽音容斷，路隔星河去住難；
　　莫道詩成無淚下，淚如泉滴亦須乾。
　　詩成，吟詠不輟。因一日晚，憑水窗，見河街上一虯鬚老叟，行步迅速，骨貌昂藏，眸光射人，彩色晶瑩，如曳冰雪，跳上船來，揖損曰：「子衷心有何不平之事，抱鬱塞之氣？」損具對之。客曰：「只今便為取賢閣及寶貨回，即發，不可更停於此也。」損察其意必俠士也，再拜而啟曰：「長者能報人間不平，何不去蔓除根，豈更容奸黨？」叟曰：「昌用之屠割生民，奪民愛室，若令誅殛，固不為難，實愆過已盈，神過怒，只候冥靈聚錄，方合身百支離，不唯難及一身，須殃連七祖為君取其妻室，未敢遒越神明。」　
　　乃人呂用之家，化形於斗拱上，叱曰：「呂用之違背君親，持行妖孽，以苛虐為志，以淫亂律身。仍於喘息之間，更慕神仙之事。冥官方錄其過，上帝即議行刑。吾今錄爾形骸，但先罪以所取劉氏之妻，並其寶貨，速還前人。倘更悅色貪金，必見頭隨刀落。」言訖，鏗然不見所適。
　　用之驚懼，遽起焚香再拜。夜遣幹事並齎金及裴氏還劉損。
　　損不待明，促舟子解維。虯鬚亦無跡矣。
　　俠婦人傳　
　　董國度字元卿，饒州人，宣和六年進士第，調萊州膠水簿。會北兵動，留家於鄉，獨處官所。中原陷，不得歸，棄官走村落，頗與逆旅主人相得。念其貧窮，為買一妾，不知何許人也。性慧解，有姿色，見董貧，則以治生為己任。罄家所有，買磨驢七八頭，麥數十斛，每得麵，自騎人市鬻之。至晚，負錢以歸，如是三年，獲利益多，有田宅矣。
　　董與母妻隔別滋久，消息皆不通，居常思戚，意緒無聊。妾叩其故。董嬖愛已深戚，不復隱，為言：「我故南官也。一家皆在鄉裡，身獨漂泊，茫無歸期。每一想念，心亂欲死。」妾曰：「如是，何不早告我？我兄善為人謀事，旦夕且至，請為君籌之。」
　　旬日，果有客，長身虯鬚，騎大馬，驅車十餘乘過門。妾曰：「吾兄至矣。」出迎拜，使董相見，敘姻戚之禮。留飲。至夜，妾始言前事，以屬客。是時虜令：「凡宋官亡命，許自陳，匿不言而被首者，死。」董業已漏泄，又疑兩人欲圖己，大悔懼，乃紿曰：「毋之。」客忿然怒，且笑曰：「以女弟托質數年，相與如骨肉，故冒禁欲致君南歸，而見疑如此，倘中道有變，且累我。當取君告身與我，以為信。不然，天明執告官矣。」董亦懼，自分必死，探囊中文書，悉與之。終夕涕泣，一聽於客。
　　客去。明日，控一馬來，曰：「行矣。」　
　　董請妾與俱。妾曰：「適有故，須少留。明年當相尋。吾手制一衲袍贈君，君謹服之，唯吾兄馬首所向。若返國，兄或取數十萬錢相贈，當勿取。如不可卻，則舉袍示之。彼嘗受我恩，今送君歸，未足以報德，當復護我去，萬一受其獻，則彼責已塞，無復護我矣。善守此袍，毋失也。」董愕然，怪其語不倫，且慮鄰裡知覺，輒揮淚上馬，疾馳到海上，有大舟臨解維，客麾使登。
　　遽南行，略無資糧道路之費，茫不知所為。舟中奉侍甚謹，具食，不相同詢。
　　才達南岸，客已先在水濱，邀請旗亭、相勞苦，出黃金二十兩，曰：「以是為太夫人壽。」董憶妾語，力辭之。客不可，曰：「赤手還國，欲與妻子餓死耶？」強留金而出。董追挽之，示以袍。客曰：「吾智果出彼下！吾事殊未了，明年挈君麗人來。」逕去，不返顧。
　　董至家，母、妻、二子俱無恙。取袍示家人，縫綻處金色隱然。拆視之，滿中皆箔金也。
　　逾年，客果以妾至，偕老焉。
　　鍾情麗集（上）　
　　時有辜生者，輅其名，本貫廣東瓊州人氏，丰姿冠玉，標格魁梧，涉獵經史，吞吐雲煙，其士林中之翹楚者也。一日，父母呼而命之曰：「爾有祖姑，適臨高黎氏，乃子奉朝延命而為土官，即爾之表叔也。經今數載，音問杳然，疏間之甚也。孔子云：『親者毋失其為親，故者毋失其為故，』此人道之當然。即辰春風和氣，景物熙明，聊備微貨，代我探訪一度，以將意耳。」生唯唯聽命，收拾琴書，命僕僮佑哥從行。
　　生既至，人謁表叔，見之盡禮。乃引赴中堂，進拜祖姑暨嬸並諸兄弟，皆相見畢。於是諸親勞苦，再三詢及故舊，生一答之，盡恭且詳。乃館生於西廡清桂西軒之下。
　　明日侵晨，踵春暉堂，揖祖姑，適瑜侍焉，將趨屏後避生，祖姑止之曰：「四哥，即兄妹也，何避嫌之有？」瑜得命，即下階與生敘禮。生奇視之，顏色絕世，光彩動人，真所謂入眼平生未曾有者也。
　　厥後，祖姑甚鍾愛生，晨昏命生與瑜侍食左右。一日，謂生曰：「諸生久失訓誨，汝叔屢求西賓無可意者。幸子之來，姑捨此發蒙，一二年間回，不晚矣，」復顧瑜曰：「四哥寒暑早晚但有所求，汝一切與之，勿以吝嗇。」女唯唯聽命。生亦拜謝。然生雖慕瑜娘之容色，及察其動靜有常，言詞簡約，生心知，不敢有犯，又以親情之故，不敢少肆也。
　　表叔擇日設帳，生徒日至，雖注意於書翰之間，而眷戀之心則不能遏也，累累行諸吟詠，不下二三十首。不克盡述，特揭其尤者，以傳諸好事者焉。是夜，坐舒懷二律，詩曰：
　　連城韞匱已多時，恥效荊人抱璞悲；
　　白璧幾雙無地種，靈台一點有天知。
　　青燈挑盡難成夢，紅葉飄來不見詩；
　　寂寂小窗無個事，娟娟斜月射書幃。
　　又：
　　多愁多病不勝情，悵味蕭然似野僧；
　　綠綺有心知者寡，箜篌無字夢難憑。
　　帶寬頓覺詩腰減，身重應知別恨增；
　　獨坐小窗春寂寂，感懷傷遇思匆匆。
　　一日，生命侍僮佑哥問瑜娘取檳榔，遂以蠟紙封蜜釀者十顆饋生，並標書於其上曰：「進御之餘，敬以五雙奉兄，伏乞垂納。」生但謂其有容色，不意其亦識字也，見之，大悅曰：「西廂之事，可得而諧矣。」乃制《西江月》一詞，命佑哥持以謝云：
　　「蠟紙重重包裹，彩毫一一題封。謂言已進大明宮，特取餘甜相奉。口嚼檳榔味美，心懷玉女情濃。物雖有盡意無窮，感德海深山重。」
　　生情不能已，復繼之以詩曰：
　　有美蘭房秀，嫣然迥不群；
　　清才謝道韞，美貌卓文君。
　　秋水娟娟月，春空藹藹雲；
　　何當階下拜，珍重謝深恩。
　　女見之，微微而哂，就以雲箋裁成小簡以復云：「感承佳作，負荷良多，第以白雪陽春，難為和耳。」生得此簡，歡喜欲狂，不覺經史之心頓放，花月之思愈興，他無所願也，惟屬意瑜娘而已。朝夕求間尋便，欲以感動於瑜。然瑜馴謹穩實，生挑之，不答；問之，不應，莫得而圖之。
　　一夕，月初出，叔嬸會飲於漱玉亭上，命使女召生。生以手揮之，使先行，生徐徐後至蘭房東軒之隅碧桃樹下，遇瑜獨歸。生曰：「五姐何歸之速耶？」瑜曰：「倦矣，故歸。」生曰：「久懷一事，欲以相聞，不識可乎？」女以他辭拒之，曰：「昨承佳作，健羨，健羨！」生曰：「不為是也。」女不答而去。生大慚，悒悒而赴宴，半酣而回。自是桃下之遇，不果所懷，遂制平韻《憶秦娥》以泄悒快之意云：
　　「憶秦娥，憶秦娥，無意奈渠何！一場好事，從此蹉跎茫茫日月如梭，悠悠光景逐流波。花天月地，畢竟閒過。」
　　一日，生在外館，女潛入其所居之軒，發其書笥，見所作之詩詞，知生之意有在也，默記歸錄，至「白璧」「靈台」之句。感歎移時，及察見生之容色變常，飲食減少，頗憐之焉。
　　一夕，女晚繡綠紗窗下，生行過窗外，偶念周美成詞「些小事，惱人腸」之句，瑜隔窗問曰：「四哥何事惱愁腸也？盍為我言之？」生曰：「子自思之。」女曰：「兄欲歸乎？」生曰：「不然。」女又曰：「兄思兄之情人乎？」生又曰：「非也。」女又曰：「春寒逼兄耶？」生曰：「非寒也，愁也。」女曰：「何不撥之乎？」生曰：「誰肯與我撥之？」女笑而不答。生欲進而與之語，自度不可，於是退居軒間，思向者窗前之言，乃作《花心動》詞以識其事：
　　「萬緒千端，惱人腸肚事，有誰共說？多麗多嬌，有意有情，特地為人撩撥。綠紗窗晚珠簾捲，繡牀上描花模月。如簧語，一聲才歇，千愁頓雪。惟恨衷腸未竭。空惆悵，歸來又成間絕，一片乍滅，千種仍生，擁就心頭如結。琴心未必君知否，何日也，山盟同設？休猜訝，不是狂蜂浪蝶。」
　　生命侍僮持以示女。女覽之，擲地曰：「我本無此意，四哥何誣人也！」僮歸以告。生殆無以為懷，乃於軒之西壁墨一鶯，後題一絕於上云：
　　遷喬公子匯金衣，獨自飛來獨自歸。
　　可惜上林如許樹，何緣借得一枝棲？　　
　　見者謂其題鶯，殊不知其托意於其中也。
　　一日，瑜之侍妾王皇桃偶過生軒，歸謂瑜娘曰：「向來見西邊軒裡瓊州官人畫一鳥於壁上，甚是可愛。」瑜因伺生出，遂抵生軒，玩索良久，知其意也，乃作一詞，書於片紙之上，置於几間而歸。詩曰：
　　金衣今已換人衣，開口如啼卻不啼；
　　自是傍牆飛不起，休悲無樹借君棲。
　　生歸，見瑜所和之詩，正想象間，忽見絳桃持一簡至。生視之，乃《喜遷鶯》之詞也。
　　「嬌癡倦極，御柳困花柔，東風無力。桃錦才舒，杏花又褪，種種惱人春色。不恨佳期難遇，惟恨芳年易。不堪據處，有東流游水，西沉斜日。記得此意，早築盟壇，共定風流策。也不難，愁更休煩夢，務要身親經歷。欲使情如膠漆，失使心同金石。相期也，在西廂待月，藍田種壁。」
　　生得此詞，大喜過望，願得之心逾於平昔，每尋間，便思與女一致款曲，終不可得。
　　後二日，表叔赴縣，嬸又寧歸，女乃潛出，直抵生軒。生偶輟講而歸，適瑜在焉。揖而謝曰：「往日之詞誠能踐之，雖死無憾。」瑜曰：「前詞聊以寬兄之意耳，豈有他哉？」生曰：「所以『身親經歷』者，果歷何事耶？」女不答，遂欲引去。生掩窗扉而阻之，因謂瑜曰：「輅自二月來抵仙鄉，今則莢已三更矣。自從見卿之後，頓覺魂飛魄散，廢寢忘餐，奈何無間可乘。今蒙下顧寒窗，而輅偶出適歸，抑且不先不後，豈非天意乎？而卿又欲見拒，此輅之所深不識也。」瑜曰：「兄言良是，妾豈不知而為是沽嬌哉？抑以人之耳目長也。」生曰「為之奈何？」瑜曰：「俗言心堅石也穿，但遲之歲月而已。」生曰：「青春易擲，若遲之以歲月，豈不錯過了時節哉！」瑜曰：「妾，女子也，局量偏淺，無有深謀遠慮，在兄之圖之，則善矣。」言未已，忽聞眾聲喧嘩，遂遁去，不得再語。生乃制《浣溪沙》以記其事云。歌曰：
　　雲淡風輕午漏遲，晝餘乘興乍歸時；忽驚仙子下瑤池，有意鶬鶊窗下語；無端百舌樹梢啼，教人如夢又如癡。
　　一日，生陪叔嬸宴於漱玉亭中，生辭倦先歸。和樂堂側聞有諷誦聲，生趨視之，見瑜獨立薔薇架下，拂拭落花。生曰：「花已謝落，何故惜之？」女曰：「兄何薄倖之甚耶？寧不念其輕香嫩色之時也？」生曰：「輕香嫩色時不能佇賞，及其已落而後拂之而惜，雖有惜花之心，而無愛花之實，與薄倖何異？」女不答。生曰：「往日『圖之』一言何如？」女曰：「在兄主之，非妾所能也。」忽覺人聲稍近，遂隱去一生作《減字木蘭花》勸思其實焉。
　　「小亭宴罷，偶到薔薇花架下，忽驚蘭香，獨立花陰納晚涼，手拈花瓣，輕輕整頓頻頻看，花落花開，厚薄之情何異哉！」
　　又一夕，叔嬸俱赴鄰家飲宴，生獨視軒中，悵悵然若有所失正憂悶間，忽見瑜娘掀扉而入，謂生曰：「兄何憂之多耶？」生曰：「愁何兄惜，但腸斷為可惜耳。」女曰：「何事腸斷？」生曰：「盡在不言中。」女曰：「妾試為兄謀之。」生曰：「卿言既許矣，不可只作一場話柄，恐斷送人性命。惟子圖之。」女曰：「兄尚不念圖，況妾乎？」生曰：「輅圖之熟矣。」女指牆，謂生曰：「奈此何？」生曰：「事至如此，雖千仞之山，尚不足畏，數仞之牆，何足道哉！」女曰：「所能圖者，其計安出？」生乃以扇指示所達之路。女曰：「是不言也，妾之一心，惟兄是從而已。事若不遂，當以死相謝。第恐兄之不能踐言耳。」生以手抱瑜，欲求合歡，女不從。正反覆間。忽聞叔嬸回，遂出迎接。次日，生乃作《鳳凰台上憶吹簫》之句以示女云：
　　「水月精神，乾坤清氣，天生才貌無雙。算來十洲三島，無此嬌娘。堪笑蘭台公子，虛想像，賦詠《高堂》。何如花解語，玉又生香。茫茫！今宵何夕，親曾見女娥，降下紗窗。又以將合，風雨來訪。記得何時，約言難踐，空愁斷腸。腸斷處，無可奈何，數仞危牆！」
　　生念瑜娘之言，欲實其心，奈何無路可達。因自思之：「惟有得向春暉堂安寢，則身可通矣。」遂稱病不起。表叔省之，生詐之曰：「近來數夜臥此軒間，才瞑目，便見鬼魅或牛頭馬面等來相擊鬧，心甚怖焉。但以精神恍惚所至，不以為意。昨夜又夢一長牙者，語余曰：『明日大王來請你，你勿復起。』不覺今日身體沉重，不能起也。」叔聞此語，大驚，遂移之東軒，命其小子名銘者伴生寢焉。生思念：「本欲設計尋人中堂，只得移向東軒，無以異於西軒也。」至夜半，佯狂大叫。舉家驚視，生良久始言曰：「向見一人冠黃巾，同昨所見長牙者坐，罵余曰：『我叫你莫起，你強要起！』黃巾者曰：『大王請先生去作平賊露布耳，無他也。』言未已，又見一紅髮尖嘴者至，曰：『連忙去，無羈滯。』將促余出，我與京力敵良久，喜諸人起來，散去，不然，被伊捉去矣。」祖姑聞言大驚，令請良巫祈禳。生乃厚賂巫者，命伊言曰：「若在此宿臥，恐性命難保。除非移入中堂，則無事矣。」彼時即移生入中堂。生病漸安，日則肄業於軒間，夜則歸宿於堂上。
　　一日，夜靜，生步入蘭房西室之前，正見瑜於月桂叢邊焚香拜月，生立牆陰以聽之。吟：
　　爐煙裊裊夜沉沉，獨立花間拜太陰；
　　心事不須重跪訴，女娥委是我知心。
　　瑜吟訖，突見生至，且驚且喜曰：「聞兄被魅，今安能到此耶？」生曰：「若非被魅，安能得此會乎？」乃相與攜手入室，明燈並坐，生熟視之，容貌愈嬌，肌膚愈瑩，情不能忍，乃曰：「我腸斷盡矣。」欲挽女以就枕。女堅意不從，曰：「妾與兄深盟密約，惟在乎情堅意固而已，不在乎朝朝暮暮之間也。苟以此為念，則淫蕩之女者也。淫蕩之女，兄何取焉！」生曰：「卿雖不從，輅之至此，設使他人知之，寧信無他事也？」女曰：「但秉吾心而已。」生雖不能自持，然見其議論，生亦喜其秉心堅確，不得已而從，遂相與坐談。女曰：「妾嘗讀《鶯鶯傳》《嬌紅記》，未嘗不掩卷歎息，但自恨無嬌、鶯之姿色，又不遇張生之才貌。見兄之後，密察其氣概文才，固無減於張生，第妾鄙陋，無二女之才也。」生曰：「卿知其一，未知其二。且當時鶯鶯有自選佳期之美，嬌紅有血漬其衣之驗，思惟今日之遇，固不異於當時也。而卿之見拒，何耶？抑亦以愚陋之跡，不足以當清雅之意耳，將欲深藏固蔽，以待善價之沽焉？」女正色而言曰：「妾豈不近人情者，但以情慾相期美滿於百年也。假使今日苟圖片時之樂，玉壺一缺，不可復補，合巹之際，將何以為質耶？」生曰：「此事輅任之，勿慮也。但不知此不足以大情之交孚，卿請勿疑。」女曰：「諺語有云：『但得五湖明月在，不愁無處下金鉤。』正此之謂也。兄自此勿復舉矣。」生興稍闌，乃口念《菩薩蠻》以贈之：
　　不緣色膽如天大，何緣得入天台界？辜負阮郎來，桃花不肯開。芳心空一寸，柔腸千萬束。從此問花神，何常苦逼人。
　　女亦口念《西江月》以答生云：
　　「借問朝雲暮雨，何如地久天長」慇懃致語示才郎，且把芳心頓放。苦戀片時歡樂，輕飄一點沉香，那時三萬六千場，樂汝無災無障。」
　　生自後每遇瑜娘，委道百端，略不經意，一見生有異志，則正言厲色以拒之。又作《望江南》詞以示生焉。
　　「堪歎寶到碧紗廚。一寸柔腸千寸斷，十回密約九回孤，夜夜相支吾。駒過隙，借問子知乎？弱草輕塵能幾許，癡雲閣雨待何如，後會恐難圖。」
　　生情不能已，復繼之以詩一絕云：
　　青鸞無計入紅樓，入到紅樓休又休；
　　爭似當初不相識，也無歡喜也無愁。
　　女見此詩，笑曰：「兄豈不喻往夜之言乎？」生曰：「余豈不喻？但以興逸難當，姑排遣之耳。」暨晚，生歸獨坐，自思：「費盡心機，得達女室，終不見從，必無意於己也。」　
　　至夜，復思：「不如與女作別。」至，則長吁短歎，凴几而臥，終不與女一言，問之亦不答，百般開喻，逼勒再三，始一啟口曰：「我今夜被你斷送了也。」女大悟，謂生曰：「兄果堅心乎？」生曰：「若不堅心，早回去矣。」因呼碧桃添香，呼生共拜於月下，祝曰：「妾瑜，生居深閨，一十七歲於茲矣。今夕以情牽意絆，不得已，以千金之體許之於情人辜輅者，非惟有愧於心，亦且有愧於月也。敬以月下共設深盟，期以死生不忘，存亡如一，無負斯心，永遠無也。苟有違者，天其誅之。」祝罷，挽生就寢，因謂生曰：「妾年殊幼，枕席之上，漠然無知，正昔人所謂『嬌姿未慣風和雨，吩咐東君好護持』。望兄見憐，則大幸矣。」生笑曰：「彼此皆然。」遂相與並枕同衾，貼胸交股。春風生繡帳，溶溶露滴牡丹開；檀口　香腮，淡淡雲生芳草溫。曲盡人間之樂，不啻若天上之降也。雖鴛鴦之交頸，鸞鳳之和鳴，亦不足形容其萬一矣。輾轉之際，不覺血漬生裙，乃起而剪之，謂生曰：「留此以為他日之驗。」生笑而從之。女以口念《虞美人》詞以贈生云：
　　「平生恩愛知多少，盡在今宵了。此情之外更無加，頓覺明珠減價玉生瑕。霎時喪卻千金節，生死從今決。祝君千萬莫忘情，堅著一鉤新月帶三星。」　　
　　生亦口念《菩薩蠻》以贈女云：
　　「春風桃李花開夜，燭燒鳳蠟香燃麝。魚水喜相逢，猶疑是夢中。
　　感情良不少，報德何時了。細君問鶯鶯，何人解此情？」
　　瑜得生詞，謝曰：「妾今溺於兄之情愛中，故至喪身失節，殊乖禮法，非緣兄亦不至此也。幸為後日之圖，則妾之所托亦至此矣。」生曰：「五姐千金之身為我而喪，猶當銘肝鏤骨以報子之深恩矣，豈肯負月下之盟耶？」　
　　自後生夜必至。一夕，謂女曰：「我以親托於門下，人皆罔知，誠恐日此事彰聞，親庭譴責，何顏重上春暉堂乎？」瑜曰：「妾雖女流，亦頗知禮，豈不知韞櫝之可嘉，失節之可醜乎！以子之情牽意絆，以至於斯，倘他日事情彰明，尋奉巾櫛於房幃之中。事若不果，當索我於黃泉之下矣。」遂相與泣下數行。又一夕，生復赴約，女目生良久，曰：「觀子之容色辭氣，決非常人，他日得侍房幃，則雖不得為命婦，亦不失為士夫之妻耳。苟流落俗子手中，縱使金玉堆山，田連阡陌，非所願也，惟兄之是從而已。」生感其節義，作詩以贈之：
　　水月精神冰雪肌，連城美壁夜光珠；
　　玉顏偏是蟾宮有，國色應言世上無。
　　翡翠衾深春窈窕，芙蓉褥軟繡模糊；
　　何當喚起王摩詰，寫出和鳴鸞鳳圖。
　　女亦吟一律以答生云：
　　深感陽和一氣噓，吹開玉砌未生枝；
　　合歡幸得逢青史，快睹曾應失紫芝。
　　碧沼鴛鴦交頸處，妝台鸞鳳下來時；
　　此情共誓成終始，莫把平生雅志虧。
　　初，瑜父選民間女之豔色者以為媵，得八人焉。分四與瑜：曰碧桃，曰絳桃，曰仙桃，曰小桃；分四與瓊：曰臘梅，曰月梅，曰紅梅，曰素梅。父命母誨之。自瑜交通生後，四桃心懷憂懼，惟恐事泄，罪及於己。一日，四桃上書諫曰：
　　「娘子生長名門，深居幽閫，世榮封襲，家極華腴，況兄神態芳菲，懿德清淑，才華充贍，妙手精工，芳名洋溢乎三洲，美譽昭彰於十邑。尚不保身律己，卻乃失節喪身，理義有虧，彝倫敗攸倘或閨中事露，門外風聞，非惟有損於己身，抑且玷辱於父母。親庭譴責，他人笑譏，名節蕩然，性命難保，誠恐楚國亡猿，禍延林木，城門失火，殃及池魚。後悔難追，噬臍莫及。苟能先事改過自新，勿蹈前非，待時而動，則娘子幸甚，妾輩亦幸甚！」　
　　瑜得書，覽畢，喟然歎曰：「爾言良是，但余以死許辜生，背之不祥。今日之事，其咎在余，諒必不相累也。」碧桃曰：「其然，豈其然乎！娘子若不自新，我輩終當去矣。」瑜泣而諭之曰：「余與辜生牽情溺已而成痼疾，身可死而情不可解也。雖蘇張更生，不能移吾之初志耳。汝欲去之則去。」四桃同泣而應之曰：「妾輩侍奉閨幃，已非一日。娘子開心見誠，推恩均惠，感戴不已，補報無由。倘若事露，娘子捐身，妾輩安能獨存哉？誓必不相負也。」乃相抱唏噓而泣。久之，拭淚吟詩一首，以釋悶云。至暮，生至，女乃出所吟詩並四桃所諫書以示。生讀之赧然。詩曰：
　　一輪明月本團圓，才被雲遮便覺殘；
　　欲把相思從此絕，別君容易望君難。
　　自後，暮聚曉散九月餘，溫存繾綣之情，益以加矣。不覺大火西流，金風又起。父母以生久別，遣僕持書促歸甚急。生得書，言之叔嬸，治裝行為歸計。生至夜復抵女室。告以將別之由。二人不忍相別，悲不能已。女泣久之，拭淚曰：「第無傷感，且盡綢繆，未知後會何時也。」生曰：「我去三兩月，必至再來，子毋勞苦構思成疾，此時暫別而已。」女吟詩二絕以別生云：
　　烏啼月落滿天霜，執手相看淚滿眶；
　　明月相如歸去也，文君從此倍淒涼。
　　又詩　　
　　秋雨梧桐葉落時，悲秋懷抱正淒淒。
　　多情自古傷離別，莫笑鶯鶯減玉肌。
　　生乃以玉耳環饋女，並留題一絕云：
　　黃雀銜來已數年，別時留取贈嬋娟。
　　莫將閒事勞心曲，常把佳音在耳邊。
　　暨晚，生以他事不果行。至夜，女命侍女以白金十錠、青布四端，花巾二十條，裙帶二十雙並詞一闋以贐生。詞名《柳梢青》：
　　「南陌花殘，西廂月暗，風雨淒淒。見說君歸，頓鬆金釧，暗減玉肌。吁嗟後會難期，將何物，表人別離。萬斛離愁，千行情淚，兩地相思。」　　
　　生亦立綴排十韻，以贈女別云：
　　「驅馳來戚裡，特地探仙鄉。推館開紗帳，攔階隨雁行。二天恩不斷，一德感難忘。況復蒹葭質，親陪蘭蕙旁。塵埃沾潔節，襟袖染餘香。月下深明固，花邊思語長，絕勝魚得水，何異鳳求凰。只謂歡娛永，誰知歸思忙，百年終有在，一旦不須傷。若問重來日，花黃與菊香。」
　　生別，至家後，行止坐臥，無非為女記憶也；經書、家事，略不介意，終日昏昏而已。先是，城之西北隅有林曰「邁游」，山明水秀，多生佳麗。有名小馥者，字微香，亦美麗超群。其欲有紡紗場之習，生嘗游畋其間，與之亦相好也。生有詩以贈之曰：　生長茅茨在邁游，微香兩字動炎舟；
　　玉般溫潤千般馥，花樣嬌妍柳樣柔。
　　巧笑千金蘇氏小，清歌一曲杜家秋；
　　也知好事人人愛，不可明知但暗求。
　　微香緝知生歸，意其必訪己也，日日候待，杳無消息；疑其必有他遇而忘己也，仍效溫飛卿體作《懊恨曲》以怨之云：
　　「蓮藕抽絲哪得長？螢火作燈哪得光。薄倖相思無實意，可憐蝶粉與蜂黃。君何不學鴛鴦鳥，雙去雙飛碧紗沼。蘭房白玉尚縹緲，何況風流雲雨了。大堤男女抹翠娥，貴財賤德君知麼？夭桃濃李雖然好，何以南山老桂柯。悠悠萬事回頭別，堪歎人生不如月。月輪無古亦無今，至今長照丁香結。」
　　微香親書於鸞箋之上以寄生。適生之友王仲顯與生檢閱詩書，得此曲，問：「誰之筆也」生以實告。遂與王生共探之，微香以生久別，見生大喜，而生憂悶之心淒然可掬。微香以王生在彼，亦不敢詰生。
　　至夜，王生倦而寢矣。微香謂生曰：「自從君之別妾也，不覺烏兔沉東西矣，而妾思君之心不啻若大旱之望雲霓也，深藏固蔽以待君久矣。近聞君歸，喜動顏色，思得一見而無由。今夜既蒙垂顧，正當繾綣以償契闊之情，而君之短歎長吁，愀然不樂，何也？豈非疑妾有外意，抑亦君有外遇乎？」生曰：「感子之情，亦已多矣。奈何以新變故易，以故變新難。」微香笑曰：「妾之言果不差矣。君盍均而惠乎？」生不答。微香曰：「君寓臨邑，所寓者得非臨邑之人乎？」生曰：「然。」復問：「女為誰名？何氏之女也？」生不肯言。再三逼勒，良久，始言曰：「子亦我之情人也，語之何害。子宜秘之，勿言其姓名於人，斯可矣。」微香指燈而言曰：「我若違子之祝，有如此燈。請言之，勿慮也。」生乃曰：「黎氏，名瑜娘，字玉真。」微香歎息而言曰：「此女無雙也。其面圓而光，其質富而溫，其目淡而澄，其聲清而婉，果然乎？」生曰：「子之言，若親見也。何以知之？」微香曰：「妾之表親有善穿珠者，前日往臨高，知黎土官宅有此人也。且聞其善詩，有作贈君否？」生乃誦其《柳梢青》與微香，微香擊節歎曰：「才貌兼全，真天上之人也。子之視我如土芥，宜乎！」乃綴《滿庭芳》一闋以贈生：
　　「月下歌聲，風前愈覺，遙思當日風流，枕邊言語，尤記在心頭，玉佩玎　，別後空惆悵，永巷閒幽。行雲去，才離楚岫，卻又入瀛洲。仙境裡，奇逢姝麗，端好綢繆。羨金桃玉李，鳳偶鸞儔。一個文章清雅，一個體態嬌柔。誰念我，雕欄獨倚，一日似三秋。」　
　　生觀訖，答謝曰：「余受卿之情不為不多，負卿之罪不為不少。」立綴《木蘭花》一闋以答之：
　　「念當時行樂，烏乍落，兔乍生，向花下重門，柳邊深巷，弄笛三聲。篳聲斷，柴門啟，見花顏玉臉笑相迎。喜氣春風習習，歌喉山溜泠泠。自從別後阻歸程，非是我無情。奈故思漫漫，新歡款款，誓下深盟。情已固，心意誰評？從今長揖謝芳卿。腸斷紡紗場上，月輪依舊光明。」
　　明日，生與王仲顯回歸。抵家後，因念微香之語，乃賦長歌一篇以貽之云：
　　「我生幸值昇平時，春風和氣長熙熙。幸今喜在繁華地，山水清佳人秀麗。此生此世豈徒然。好展情懷樂所天。不須貪富貴，何必求神仙。萬歲虛生耳，縱有千金亦須死。世間萬事非所圖，惟慕嬌嬈而已矣。君不見卓文君，至今千載芳名傳。古人今人同一致，有能逢之亦如是。人生年少不再來，人生年少早開懷。黃金買笑何足吝，白壁偷期休更猜。我曹不是風流客，懶向金門獻長策。腳跟踏遍海天涯，久慕傾城求未得。親家有貌傾長城，養在閨門十八齡。蕙性芳心真慧默，玉顏花貌最嬌婷。春山遠遠秋波淺，嫩筍纖纖紅玉軟。暗麝芬芬百合香，綠雲繞繞雙烏綰。上迫能字衛夫人，下視工詩朱淑真。柳絮才華應絕世，梅花標格更超群。雲閨霧閫深深處，羅幃錦帳重重貯。絕似女亙娥住廣寒，世人有恨無由睹。記得春光三月天，曾尋流水到桃源，春暉堂上分明見，晚繡窗前款語言。僮僕往來傳意緒，詩詞絡繹通情愫。數向花前密約時，同於月下深盟處。燭搖紅影照蘭房，香噴清煙襲象牀。一線枕痕生玉暈。碧梧枝上鳳求凰。芳情百紐丁香結，真心一點薔薇血。個中頓覺兩心知，妙處偏難向人說。朝朝暮暮戀高唐，忘卻人間日月忙。回首白雲歸思切，金刀寸寸斷人腸。美滿恩情呻吟絕，消魂怕唱陽關疊。依依牛女隔星河，杳杳行雲歸楚峽。香羅玉帶又何時，惆悵西風淚濕衣。舊摺牽連推不去，新愁構結有誰知？惟有多情舊知己，每把甘言慰愁耳。素承佳惠感難忘，自覺違心漸不已。徐徐思後更思前，回首西風一悵然。應是前生曾結種，今生偏得美人憐。」
　　微香得此歌，以示其同伴，眾口稱誇，乃作手卷以贈生焉，名《雙美》，請畫圖於其首。微香又摅妙思，作《並美序》一篇以冠其端，復繼之以長歌一篇，以傳好事者：
　　「瓊南人物傾天下，才子佳人兩無價。吳門越裡何足數，蓬島瑤池此其亞。畫堂重重閉廣寒，青馬總白馬躍金鞍，奇才美貌皆潘岳，膩體香肌盡弱蘭，弱蘭潘岳今何許，聽說瓊林鶯鳳侶，鳳友鸞朋絕世無，一雙兩好真無比，天與風流年少郎，聲名籍甚動炎荒，風流驥子麒麟種，繪句文章錦繡腸。生來灑落起塵俗，繡虎雕龍總入目，萬卷詩書千首詞，儒林聲價僉推獨。」　
　　「清風明月四清香，勝景名山足遍經，曾向朱崖開絳帳，忽從戚裡遇嬌婷。嬌婷自是豪家子，長養綺羅叢隊裡。天上麗質自超群，百媚千嬌誰與比。水月精神冰雪肌，芙蓉如面柳如眉。春山淡淡橫蛾黛，戛玉鏗金滿箱帙。光風溜溜泛崇蘭，碧澗溶溶淄皓月。久擅芳名蕩海天，風流年少總誇妍。笑他有眼何曾見，羨子相逢豈偶然。偶然相逢真奇遇，時人哪得知幽趣。紅葉飄時傳麗情，緋花泛水知山路。直入蓬萊第一層，雲軒謁拜許飛瓊。鮫綃帕上題佳句，鵲尾爐前結好盟。黃鶯喚友遷喬木，丹鳳求凰棲翠竹。醉風芍藥暗生香，著雨夭桃紅杏肉。絕似女亙娥降月宮，宛如神女下巫峰。蟠嫌月殿非人世，卻笑巫山是夢中。何似相逢明盛世，早能償此風流債。負茲通古通今才，遇此傾國傾城態。傾國傾城世無多，通古通今誰復過。絕勝蘭香伴張碩，宛然蕭史共秦娥。秦娥蕭史雖無比，不過如斯而已矣。天香國色產南方，不讓中州獨專美。嗟予與子素相知，記紡紗場夜月時。求作狂歌贊並美，聊傳盛事記佳期。」
　　生自別瑜娘之後，倏爾斗柄三移，而相思之心常在目也。奈鱗鴻杳絕，後會無期。是月某日，適值祖姑生旦，乃托所親於父母曰：「某日祖姑誕辰，理當往賀。何吝四哥一行，而不使這往慶之耶？」父從之。次日，遂命生起行。
　　既至，表叔一家喜生再至，莫不欣然。於是復館生於清桂西軒之下。生遍視窗軒如故，詩畫若新，惟庭前花木有異耳。不勝舊游之感，遂吟近體一律以寓意云。詩曰：　一年兩度謁仙門，前值春風後值冬。
　　草木已非前度色，軒窗還是舊遊蹤。
　　重臨桃柳三三逕，專憶高唐六六峰。
　　知是盟言應不負。虛言萬事轉頭空。
　　生至數日，不能與瑜一語。因設臥中之計，尚未克果，而祖之壽日屆矣。乃制《千秋歲令》一首以慶壽云：
　　「菊遲梅早，報道陽春小。坡老說，斯時好。北堂萱草茂，南極箕星皎。人盡道，群仙此日離蓬島。
　　寶日紅光耀，金獸祥煙裊。絲竹嫩，蟠桃老。永隨王母壽，卻笑　　夭。畫堂年年，膝下斑衣繞。」
　　後一日，生侍祖姑於春暉堂上，忽見堂側新開一池，趨往視之，正見瑜倚牆而觀畫焉。生笑而言曰：「不期而遇，天耶？人耶？」瑜娘曰：「天也，豈人之所能也。不期然而然，非天而何？」遂挽生共坐於石砌之上，且曰：「此地僻陋，人跡罕到，姑坐此，徐徐而入可也。」遂相與訴其間闊之情、夢想之苦，自未及酉，雙雙不離。輒聞嬸喚之聲，女遂辭去，復顧生云：「自此路可以達妾室，兄其圖之。」生頷而歸館。
　　至更深夜散，生遂逾垣而入，直抵女室。時女已睡熟矣。生扣窗良久，女始驚覺，欣然啟扉相迓，謂生曰：「待兄久不至，聊集古句一絕，方凴几而臥，不覺酣矣。」生問：「詩安在？」乃出以示生。詩曰：
　　月娥霜宿夜漫漫，鬢亂釵橫特地賽；
　　有約不來過夜半，月移花影上欄杆。
　　生覽畢，亦口點律詩一首云：
　　再到天台訪玉真，入門一笑滿門春；
　　羅幃繡被雖依舊，璧月瓊枝又是新。
　　可喜可嘉還可異，相恰相愛更相親；
　　何當推廣今宵事，永作天長地久人。
　　女亦和云：
　　洞房今夜降仙真，軟玉溫香滿被春；
　　慢說到離情最苦，且誇歡會事重新。
　　意中有意無他意，親上加親愈見親；
　　欲得此情常不斷，早尋月下檢書人。
　　自是，二人眷戀之情，逾於平昔。一日，生攜微香手卷示瑜，看未畢，怒曰：「祝兄勿多言，卻又多言！妾之名節掃地矣！」生解說百端，女終不與一言。後夜復往，堅閉重門，無復啟矣。女方悔已前非，咎生薄倖，終日閉門愁坐，對鏡悲吟，一二日間才與生相見，見之亦不交半語。凡半月間，生不能申其情，悒怏滿懷，大失所望，乃述近體一律以示之。詩曰：
　　巧語言成拙語言，好姻緣作惡姻緣；
　　回頭恨捻章台柳，赧面慚看大華蓮。
　　只謂玉盟輕蕩泄，遂教鈿誓等閒遷；
　　誰人為挽天河水，一洗前非共往愆！　　
　　女玩味良久，始笑曰：「兄寓此久矣，盍歸紡場之情人乎？」生曰：「卿何為出此言也？獨不記月下深盟乎？且輅當時不合失於漏泄，罪咎固無所逃矣。然古人有言曰：『往者不可諫，來者猶可追。』遽忍以往者之小過而阻來者之大事乎？」瑜拜謝曰：「兄之心金石不諭，妾之怒聊以試兄耳。」亦續呤一律云：
　　一洗前非共往愆，從今整頓舊姻緣；
　　聲名蕩漾雖堪怨，情意慇懃尚可憐。
　　任是春光先漏泄，忍教月魄不團圓；
　　莫言幽約無人會，已被紗場作話傳。
　　自此之後，情好如初。一日，以前卷展開評論，瑜曰：「微之才調何如？」生曰：「卿乃天上之碧桃，月中之丹桂，彼不過微芳小豔而已，豈敢與卿爭妍媸也？正昔人所謂西施、王嬙爭洗腳臉與天下婦人鬥美者也。」女感其言，乃吟《長相思》詞一闋以戲生。詞曰：
　　「大巫山，小巫山，暮暮朝朝雲雨間，誰憐鳳偶閒？　
　　歌已闌，樂已闌，才向瑤台覓彩鸞，金波依舊團。」
　　一夕，天色陰晦，生與瑜待月久之，乃同歸室，席地而坐，盡出其所藏《西廂》、《嬌紅》等書，共枕而玩。瑜娘曰：「《西廂》如何？」生曰：「《西廂記》，不如何人所作也。記始於唐元微之，嘗作《鶯鶯傳》並《會仙詩》三十韻，清新精絕，最為當時文人所稱羨。《西相記》之權輿，其本如此與歟？然鶯鶯之所作寄張生：『自從別後減容光，萬轉千愁懶下牀。不為旁人羞不起，為郎憔悴卻羞郎。』如詩最妙，可以伯仲義山、牧之，而此記不載，又不知其何故也。且句語多北方之音，南方之人知其意味者罕焉。」又問：「《嬌紅記》如何？」生曰：「亦未知其作者何人，但知其間曲新，井井有條而可觀，模寫言詞之可聽，苟非有製作之才，焉能若是哉！然其諸小詞可人者，僅一二焉。子觀之熟矣，其中有何詞最佳？」瑜曰：「《一剪梅》。」生曰：「以余看之，似有病。」女曰「兄勿言，待妾思之……」曰：「誠有之。」生曰：「何在？」曰：「離有悲歡、合有悲歡乎！」生笑曰：「夫離別，人情之所不忍者也。大丈夫之仗劍對樽酒，猶不能無動於心，況子女之交者！其曰離有悲，固然也；離有歡，吾不之信也。至若會合者，人情之所深欲者也。雖四海五湖之人，一朝同處，而喜氣歡聲亦有不期然而然者，況男女交情之深乎？謂之合有歡，不言可知矣；謂之合有悲，吾未之信也。「瑜曰：「兄以何者為佳？」生曰：「『如此鍾情古所稀，吁嗟好事到頭非；汪汪兩眼西風淚，灑向陽台化作灰』一詩而已。」瑜曰：「與其景慕他人，孰若親歷自己？妾之遇兄，較之往昔，殆亦彼此之間而已。他日幸得相逢、當集平昔所作之詩詞為一集，俾與二記傳之不朽，不亦宜乎？」生感其意乃口占一曲，自歌以寫懷云。歌云：
　　「西江月上團團，錦江水上潺潺，荒墳貴賤總摧殘，回首真堪歎。回首真堪歎，可憐骨爛名殘。須要留情種在人間，付與多情看。待月情懷，偷香手段，這般人真好漢。想崔張行蹤，憶溫嬌氣岸，相對著腸頻斷。此情此意，我爾相逢豈等閒。須教通慣，休教明判，若還團　，且作風流傳。」
　　初交通後，收斂行蹤，無罅隙之議，故人無知者。因其再至，情慾所迷，罔有忌憚，一家婢妾，皆有所覺，所不知者，惟瑜父母而已，瑜亦厚禮諸婢，欲使緘口，奈何一家婢妾，皆欲白之。自度不可久留乃設歸計，尚未果也。忽一婢懼事露而罪及己，竊言之祖姑。祖姑以生之馴謹達禮，必無此事，反笞其婢。自是眾口漸息，時又叔嬸同寓別館，祖姑昏耄，不知防備，始大得計，略無畏懼之心，暮樂朝歡，無所不至。
　　一日，生與女同步後園晴雨軒中，徘徊觀竹，正談謔間，而瑜之弟黎銘值而見之。生大駭，恐言於叔嬸、乃厚結銘心。初，生有一琴，名曰「碧泉」，平生所嗜好者，銘嘗問取，生不之與，至是而遺焉。雖得銘之歡心，然而諸婢切切含恨，惟待叔嬸回而發其事。生自思其形跡不寧，「設使叔嬸知之，負愧無地矣！」托以歸省，告於祖姑。祖姑固留之再三，生終不從，瑜夜潛出。與生別曰：「好事多磨，自古然也歡會未幾，讒言禍起、奈之何哉！兄歸，善加保養，方便再來，毋以間隙遂成永別，使設盟為虛言也。」因泣下而沾襟。生亦掩淚而別。女以《一剪梅》詞一闋並詩一首授生，曰：「妾之情意，竭於此矣。兄歸，展而歌之，即如妾之在左右也。」　　
　　「紅滿苔階綠滿枝，杜宇聲歸，杜宇聲悲。交歡未久又分離，彩鳳孤飛，彩鳳孤棲。別後相逢是幾時？後會難知，後會難期。此情何以表相思？一首情詞，一首情詩。」　　
　　又詩　　
　　萬點啼痕紙半張，薄言難盡覺心傷；
　　分明一把離情劍，刺碎心肝割斷腸。
　　生亦綴《法駕引》詞一首以別女云：
　　「歸去也，歸去也，歸去幾時來？峽口雲行仙夢杳，雨中花謝鳥聲衰。落葉滿空階。真個是，真個是惱人腸。沙上鴛鴦棲未穩，枝頭鸚鵡叫何忙。相對淚沾裳。須記得，須記得月前盟。料必兩人扶一木，莫移鉤月帶三星。了此此生情。」
　　女覽畢，謂生曰：「往者邁游諸女，所贈之詩，意甚忠厚，今將薄禮寄兄以饋之，可乎？」生曰：「可。」女乃命侍女取花巾十條、裙帶三十三雙，與生收訖。女含淚再拜而別。
　　生既歸家後，命僕以女所寄之物以遺紡紗微香。微香寄聲與僕曰：「寄語辜郎：彼豈不知趙姬之言乎？」僕歸以告。友王仲顯在焉，生微笑之。友曰：「何謂也？」「按《左傳》趙姬之事，趙姬曰：『好新慢故易』，微香特諷予也。」次日，復命僕持書以貽。微香展而視之，乃唐體詩一律：
　　寄與多情舊故人，幾乎為爾喪良姻。
　　空懷杜牧三生夢，難化瞿曇百憶身。
　　雨散雲收成遠別，花紅柳綠為誰春？　
　　不堪回首紗場上，風雨瀟瀟月一輪。
　　微香靜而思之，終疑於「為爾喪良姻」之句，欲生之來以實之，亦次韻一律以答之。詩曰：
　　彼情人是我情人，就說無因亦有因；
　　千里相思愁裡句，幾番歡會夢中身。
　　天邊依舊當時月，洞口時非往日春；
　　若念小樓移手處，重來花下賞冰輪。
　　生感其意，復以詩一律而之焉：
　　紡紗場下好情緣，回首西風倍慘然。
　　已按赤繩先繫足，免勞青鳥再銜箋。
　　任從柳色隨風舞，莫惜韶光徹夜圓。
　　不是憐新違舊約，由來好事兩難全。
　　微香得此詩，知生之絕己也，然而慕生之心，未嘗少替，亦和一律以答生云：
　　紡紗場下舊情緣，怕說情緣只默然。
　　今日翻成班氏扇，當時休制薛淺箋。
　　玉簫已負生前約，金鏡偏教別處圓。
　　自是人心多變易，休教好事不雙全。
　　生時名籍甚，郡邑感欲舉生為癢生。生父愛子，不欲遠涉利途，恐致離別之苦。然而眾論紛紛，無時休息。生潛喜，乘間言於父母曰：「除非出外可避。」父喜曰：「可往祖姑家少辟五六個月，眾口無不息矣。」生曰：「如或官司逼勒，如何？」父曰：「只言隨伯父之任矣。」生之伯父有為高官者。父即日命促裝起行。
　　既至，祖姑一家欣喜，待禮如初。生告所來之由，叔曰：「倘若不厭寒微，姑寓於此，朝夕與諸少講明理義，此某之所深幸也。」生拜謝，退居所寓之軒，偶見綠紗窗上題詩一絕云：
　　壁上鶯還在，梁間燕已分。
　　軒中人不見，無語自消魂。
　　生知是瑜之筆，亦書一絕於其旁曰：
　　腸斷情難斷，春風燕又回。
　　東風和且暖，雅稱結雙飛。
　　生思玩間，忽見瑜娘獨至，且喜且悲，再拜謂生曰：「兄真信士也緣自兄歸之後，媒妁克諧，逮無虛日，父母亦有許之者，但未成事矣妾心想迫於父母之命，不得已而飲恨於九泉之下，不及與君決別為懷。今幸不死，尚得相見，殆天意乎！未審計將安出？」生曰「此輅之所以日夜切思者也。蓋嘗思之有三：親戚不可為婚，一也；父母之命不可違，二也；不敢言於父母，三也；為今之計，惟在乎卿主之而已。瑜曰：「凡妾可力為者，敢不自效！望兄指引，則善矣「生密約於女耳邊之言。女曰：「正合妾意。」言未已，忽聽籠中鸚鵡叫：「大人回大人回！」女聞之，遂遁去。臨行，反顧生曰：「蘭房之約，三更後、四更前，正其時也。」　
　　是夜，月明如晝，萬籟無聲，生視諸僕皆睡熟，輕步潛至女室。瑜見之，喜不自勝，且曰：「醜陋之質，於兄故不敢辭，但以月明花開之景，不可常得，思與君少同佇賞，以度良宵耳。」生然其言，遂並枕於玩月亭右廂階下。俄而，婢女數輩捧饈肴至，羅列滿前。二人相與勸酬，極盡款曲。女曰：「既逢佳景，可無述作以記之乎？」生曰：「短章寂寥，片文拘泥，與其合筆而和題，孰若同聲相應，亦足以見吾二人之京力敵也。」瑜曰：「就以『月夜喜相逢』為題，五十韻為率。」生即為首倡曰：
　　「今夕是何夕，奇逢不偶然。況當明媚景，正是陽陽天（生）。爛爛星珠燦，圓圓月鑒圓（女）。風輕萬籟寂，露氵邑百花鮮（生）。河影清還淺，奎纏斷復連。乾坤真罔極，光景自無邊。大地冰壺隱，長空雪浪翻。連枝橫鑒發，索暈隔簷穿。更漏轉三鼓，槐陰過八磚。溶溶春似海，緩緩夜如山。織女偷情看，女亙娥著意憐。千年逢一會，二鳥降雙仙。談笑幽亭上，追隨小院前。各分雙美具，端的四兼全，舊恨應皆釋，新愁覺欲顛。重來諧素約，又共展華筵。何須金石奏，且把海螺傳。美酒傾珠落，香羹和玉涎。膾用金刀切，茶將活火煎。冰壺雙髻執，羅扇小鬟掾。並枕挨肩玉，低鬟動髻蟬。柔腸頻眷戀，蓮步漫周旋。紅袖深藏筍，羅衣懶上船。獻酬多節重，議論每牽纏。不必宣金石，何勞奏管弦。休亂同坐久，且共把詩聯。共吐珠璣唾，同裁月露篇。聲聲爭響亮，字字競鮮妍。可羨唐商隱，堪誇燕麗鮮。新清開府句，秀麗薛濤箋。佳興如流水，神詞若湧泉。孟郊應退舍，蔡琰可齊肩。轉戰敵逢敵，擒詞玄又玄。剡藤煩字掃，香劑倩思研。宴罷情將困，吟成意尚牽。掀幃香自馥，入室步爭先。好事雖多舛，佳期喜獨偏。笑攜雙玉手，共臥五花氈。蓮步移紅玉，珊瑚墮翠鈿。交加連理樹，掩映並頭蓮。色膽大如斗，麗情深若淵。耳邊言切切，心上意懸懸。鳳蠟搖紅影，龍誕薰碧煙。情癡疑是夢，骨冷不成眠。繾綣兩情好，綢繆一意專。既如魚水樂，又似漆膠堅。了畢平生願，深酬宿世緣。愈親須愈敬，相守莫相捐。密約長如此，深盟永不遷。任他滄海竭，此樂尚綿綿。」
　　聯成，女出雲箋，命小桃書皆，已四鼓矣。不復就枕，但立會而已。生口占一絕云：
　　名花並立笑春風，誰識常空一竅通；
　　欲驗佳期何處見，白羅襠上有殘紅。
　　自是之後，幽會佳期，殆無虛日；眷戀之情，親昵之意，有不可得而言語形容者。所作詩詞，不可盡述，姑記含蓄意深者十絕：
　　昨夜東風透玉壺，零零湛露滴真珠；
　　寄言未問飛瓊道，曾識人間此樂無？　　
　　一線春風透海棠，滿身香汗濕羅裳；
　　個中好趣惟心覺，體態惺忪意味長。
　　臉脂腮粉暗交加，濃露於今識翠華。
　　春透錦衾紅浪湧，流鶯飛上小桃花；　
　　寶鴨香消燭影低，波翻紅浪枕邊欹。
　　一團春色融懷抱，口不能言心自知。
　　葡萄軟軟蟄酥胸，但覺形銷骨花熔；
　　此樂不知何處是，起來攜手問東風。
　　淡淡溶溶總是春，不知何物是吾身；
　　自驚天上神仙降，卻笑陽台夢不真。
　　形體雖殊氣味通，天然好合自然同；
　　相憐相愛相親處，盡在津津一點中。
　　半夜牙牀戛玉鳴，小桃枝上宿流鶯；
　　露華濕破胭脂體，一段春嬌畫不成。
　　燭盡香消夜悄然，洞房別是一般天；
　　若教當日襄王識，肯向陽台夢倒顛？　　
　　魚水相投氣味真，不覓不漆自相親。
　　兩身忘卻誰為我，恐是天生連理人。
　　一日，祖姑獨坐春暉堂上，生侍之，顧生，謂之曰：「昔傳姻事為『下玉鏡』，何謂也？」生以溫嶠事為對。祖姑曰：「汝知發問之意乎？」生曰：「不知「祖姑復曰：「汝宜益加進修，吾之女孫，誓不他適，當合事汝，亦使溫嶠之下玉鏡台也。」生拜謝。至暮，生以此告瑜。瑜喜，笑曰：「古人有言：『人心同欲，天必從之。』豈虛語乎！」生曰：「明日當辭歸，遣媒言議，勿失時也。」　
　　明日，遂告歸。及抵家，以祖姑之語告其父。父欣然從之。
　　擇日命媒行。既至，以所來之由告叔。叔曰：「四哥才貌，出眾超群，可敬可愛，得婿如此，足慰人心。奈他人譏笑何？「媒曰：「何傷上？溫嶠之下玉鏡台，娶姑之女。」又曰：「老泉女適程氏，舅之子也，況乃孫乎？自古迄今，但聞傳其事以為話，未聞以是病之者，夫何疑之有？」叔嬸允之，遂備黃金二錠、羊一牽為定禮。生婢有名朝華者，從媒同至，乃出書以示瑜。瑜披讀曰：
　　「玉真小娘子妝次：輅世忝姻緣之契，締結絲蘿；叨因叔姪之情，寓居門館。詎意天緣會合，親逢曠世之嬌嬈；人意交孚，果是前生之配偶。榮生意外，喜溢眉間。緬想淑候，蘭蕙其芳，冰霜其潔。秋水為神玉為骨。傾國傾城；芙蓉如面柳如眉，欺花欺月。柳絮因風起，藹然謝道韞之才；寒藻漾漣漪，粲若朱淑真之文采，誠所謂天上之神仙，君子之好逑者也。輅一寒如此，百技無能才匪逮人，貌非出眾，忝得一拜於雲階，幸已足矣。何況側身於玉樹，恩莫大焉。粉身不足報深恩，萬死亦難酬厚德。捫心有愧，揣己何堪！曩間太夫人困親致親之言，歸心如箭；今見椿府君執柯伐柯之舉，喜意若川。倘若叔嬸再不他辭，想應汝我心諧所願。百歲姻緣，在此一舉；千金會合，於此片時。專望竭力贊襄，毋使青蠅諧白玉；同心協力，庶教丹桂近嫦娥。則平生之心願足矣，月下之深盟遂矣。茲因媒氏之行，敬緘鸞而申微悃，犄訴鳳以候佳音。即辰天地皆春，山川自秀，伏乞保重千金之體，永終百歲之斯。不宣。」　　
　　後二日，媒氏告歸，瑜乃出箋以寄生。書曰：
　　「伏自一別，倏爾旬餘。蝴蝶之粉未乾，麝蘭之香猶在。松竹之表，嘗彷彿於目睫之間；金石之盟，每念昭於心胸之內。忽喜冰人之傳事，又兼雲翰之飛來，千欣！千喜！恭惟文侯，學貫天人，博通古今，風采聯賈少年之弱冠，文華負李長吉之奇才，誠所謂文苑中之英華，士林中之翹楚者也。瑜也，貌微無豔，才非道韞，自謂於世而無取，夫何在兄而見憐！幽谷發陽春，多感吹噓之力；葵花傾曉日，幸蒙光照之私。托庇二天，已非一日。詎意人心有欲，天意果從。因親復得致其親，莫非命也；發願竟能諧所願，不亦宜乎！忽然手舞足蹈不自知者，自此生順死安而無復憾。事已定矣，言更何云。惟冀尊所聞行所知，益勵占鼇之志；宜其家宜其室，佇看協鳳之祥。不須待月於西廂，正好挑燈於此牖。毋使前人獨專其美，免思微弱以喪厥躬。伏乞鼎調，以副時望。不宣。」
　　是月也，忽御史按臨，遴選其民俊秀者補弟子員。鄉老舉生為癢生。後數日，生父齎書以告瑜父。生乃吟詩一首，並寫花箋以寄瑜云。詩曰：
　　書寄平生故友知，白衣今已換藍衣；
　　微軀從此如鷹繫，佳兆何時協鳳飛？　
　　上苑杏花愁客去，西廂明月為誰輝；
　　幾回暗想蘭房事，不覺臨風淚雨霏。
　　瑜得生書，亦作一啟並歌一篇以復云：
　　「寂寂蘭房愁獨倚，忽見長鬚致雙鯉。雲是瓊林天上郎，如今已入黌宮裡。入黌宮裡為何如？漸磨仁義樂菁莪。方巾員領真超卓，黃卷青燈好切磋。君不見買臣衣錦歸鄉裡，至今名姓光青史。又不見縣官負弩迎相如，至今千載揚芳譽。男兒得志皆如此，男兒莫厭窮經史。上方治定崇文儒。彬彬濟濟紆青紫夫君子，真英豪，器宇堂堂氣象高。心通萬卷猶嫌少，日誦千篇不憚勞。此時已入文章島，如今遂卻平生志。鏖戰文場應可期，太平治化真堪異。蒲柳應知得所依，鳳凰何日又同飛？坐看花誥班班降，羞殺人間俗子妻。」
　　僕歸，將詩以示生。生與同學生覽畢，無不歎服稱美者。其啟中有儆句云：「但能有理可明，不怕無官可做。」又云：「前日之良心因妾既喪，今日之放心在君當收。」又云：「莫為蒲柳之姿，墮卻雲雷之志。」若此之言，非見理分明者，安能及此耶？但恨不見全篇以書記焉。
第十卷    
　　鍾情麗集（下）　
　　時生入泮宮，不兩月間，生父捐館。生哀毀逾禮，水漿不入口者三日。既葬，躬自負土，不受人助。事喪之後，終日哭泣而已，不復視事。時有白鶴雙竹之祥，人以為孝感所致。自是家道日益凌替，而瑜娘之父始有悔親之心，遂不復相往來。而生以守制不暇理事，故相聞者二載。
　　然而，瑜娘慕生之心曷嘗少置？風景之接於目，人事之感於心累累形諸詩詞，多不盡錄，姑記一二以語知音者：　
　　《鵲橋仙》　
　　征鴻無信，游鯉無信，更相望斷春潮無信。玉郎何處不歸來，怎禁許多愁悶。
　　青山有盡，綠水有盡，惟有相思無盡。眼中珠淚幾時乾，腸一寸截成千雨。
　　《瑞鷓鴣》　
　　芭蕉葉上雨難留，松柏梢頭風未收。萬悶千愁無著處，並歸心上與眉頭。
　　腸如襪線條條斷，淚似源頭混混流；倚遍欄杆人不見，滿天風雨下西樓。
　　《長相思》　
　　春望歸，秋望歸，目斷江山幾落暉？啼痕點點垂。
　　朝相思，暮相思，終日何時是盡期，腹心寄與誰。
　　一剪梅　
　　雨打梨花深閉門，辜負青春，虛負青春。傷心樂事共誰論？花下消魂，月下銷魂。
　　愁聚眉峰盡日顰，千點啼痕，萬點啼痕。曉看天色暮看雲，行也思君，坐也思君。
　　《滿庭芳》　
　　愁鎖春山，淚潺秋水，時時獨向西樓。望窮千里，山水兩悠悠。惆悵故人獨在，離別後，日月難留，腸斷處，愁愁悶悶，風雨五更頭。相思何日了？無腸可斷，有淚空流。湘江潮信斷。楚峽雲收。只恐尋春來晚，東君去，花謝鶯愁。蘭房下，何時與你，交頸綢繆。
　　時有同郡富室符氏者，素聞瑜娘才色，聞生久不至，遂散財賂，冀必得瑜娘為婚而後已焉。故有與瑜娘父言者，非譽符家道之華腴，必稱符才貌之出眾；非言生家道之簫條，必毀生行止之落魄。瑜父遂欲解盟，然猶慮構成詞訟，猶豫未決。又有為其畫策者，曰：「內外兄弟姊妹，不可為婚，法律所禁。倘或興訟，以此推之，何畏之有？」遂決意許符氏，然猶未敢輕動。或勸其家納符氏聘禮者，瑜父從之。
　　後瑜娘緝知，悲不自勝，以死自誓，終不他適。黎聞之怒。瑜乃以白巾自縊，賴眾知覺救解，得免，黎方覺悔。
　　然瑜之心雖不肯從，而符之盟終不可解。正憂悶間，忽值其姑適王氏者歸宅，黎命之解慰瑜心。乃從容勸瑜百端，瑜應之曰：「結親即結義，是以寸絲既定，千金莫移。兒非不愛榮盛而惡貧賤，但以棄舊憐新、厭貧就富，天理有所不容，人心有所未安。」姑以瑜言告黎。黎曰：「瑜言誠有理，奈彼符氏何！」凡瑜所親愛者，皆令勸之。
　　一日，碧桃乘間諫瑜曰：「娘子懿德嬌顏為諸姊妹中之巨擘，然諸娘子俱適名門宦族，或田連阡陽，或金玉盈箱，娘子獨許塞酸，妾輩甚不愜意。近見大人別締良姻，甚喜，甚喜。娘子何故短歎長吁，減卻飲食，損壞形容，而為傷感之甚耶？」瑜曰：「汝知其一，不知其二。古人有言：『今日之富貴，安知異日不貧賤乎？今日之貧賤，安知異日不富貴乎？』彼符氏雖富，而子弟之品不過一庸夫而已，縱有金玉盈箱，田連阡陌，生為無名人，死亦作無名之鬼，何足道哉！且辜生雖貧，丰姿冠世，學問優長，他日折丹桂如採薪，取青衿如拾芥，何患不至富貴乎？未受他人盟約，尚當求擇其人，況先受其人之聘而負之，可乎？有死而已，誓無他志！」　
　　一日，絳桃復諫曰：「自從定親於辜生之後，一別三年，諒必他娶矣。娘子何故勞心苦志以思之？」瑜曰：「汝勿言，吾意已決矣，縱蘇張更生，不能搖動。且辜生久不至者何哉？蓋生之為人，孝心純篤，乃翁捐館，方泣血而不暇，況有心相憶乎！」又曰：「夫願相守而厭相離者，淫婦之道也；托終身而期遠大者，賢女之所慮也。爾何以淫婦期我，而不以賢女期我也？」絳桃拜謝而去。
　　未幾，生家蒼頭忽持書至，密以一箋付瑜。瑜泣讀之，乃疊韻詩一首。詩曰：
　　一自往年邊扁便，無奈鱗鴻專轉傳；
　　勸君莫把海山盟，移向他人擅閃善。
　　自是生即礻覃之後，夜就枕間，忽夢往黎室。至相見，托延至於春暉堂後新創亭上，坐，顧其額曰「剪燈書窗」。壁間所掛吹彈歌舞四面，上題有詩，附錄於此：
　　誰家有女顏如玉，手持幾竿崑崙竹。鏤玉編雲一片形，含商弄羽千般曲。一聲遲，曉起丹山彩鳳啼，一聲疾，半夜孤舟嫠婦泣。一聲喜，秦樓仙侶同飛起。一聲悲，異時忠臣乞食歸。十分妙趣真無比，良工寫入霜縑裡。時人莫道是無聲，仙聲不入凡人耳。右調《佳人呂玉簫》）　　
　　中虛外實木一片，吟向佳人懷裡見。玎玎　　幾點聲，細細粗粗四條線。一聲清，半夜天空萬籟鳴。一聲濁，八月秋風群木落。一聲苦，昭君馬上啼紅雨。一聲歡，妃子宮中洗祿山。風流畫史龍眠老，筆端寫出心機巧。勸君莫道是無聲，仙聲不入凡人耳。（右調《美人弄琵琶》）　　
　　及生至黎室，正想間，忽見瑜至，相見之際，再拜再悲。遂相攜手入於蘭房之內，二人席地而坐，歷道其夢想之苦，解盟之由，相對泣下。己而，瑜收淚言曰：「今日相逢，將以為可喜，則又可悲；將以為可悲，則又可喜。悲耶？喜耶？吾不得而知之。」生曰：「苦盡甘來，一定之理。前日之別固為可悲，今日之逢則又可喜。可悲者既已過矣，可喜者當以與卿共之。」瑜遂命絳桃取酒，與生共飲；復命仙桃以侑觴。仙桃請歌東坡《水調歌頭》。生曰：「時勢不同，情懷各異，彼調雖妙，非吾事也。」乃止。綴《念奴嬌》一曲，命仙桃歌之。絳桃和之。
　　「牽情不了，歎人生、無奈別離多少。一自慇懃相送後，天際歸舟杳。倩女魂消，崔微夢斷，瘦得肌膚小。寒閨深閉，腸斷幾番昏曉。----悵望鳳鳥不至，妖禽怪鳥，恣狂呼亂叫。悄悄憂心何處告，且喜故人重到。滿酌流霞，浩歌明月，與爾開懷抱。等閒信筆，寫出《念奴嬌》調。」
　　曲盡，二人相顧，淚灑數行。已而，復相謂曰：「今夜相逢，何啻夢中，可無述以記之乎？」生請其題。女曰：「以『夢寐』為題，不亦宜乎？」生遂援筆書於紙屏之上：
　　久別喜相會，春從何處來？四眼頻相顧，雙睛何快哉！對此一盞燈，如醉又如癡。大旱見雲霓，和羹得鹽梅。憂心冰似泮，笑臉天如開。乎童且奉酒，與君開此懷。」
寫畢，忽聽角起樵樓，鐘鳴梵宇，推枕欠伸，乃是南柯一夢。
　　而且憶其詩詞，因起而錄之。始欲治裝竟尋舊約，奈何秋闈在邇，正吾人當發憤之際也，更兼有司催逼赴試甚急，生無奈何，只得起服回學肄業。故特命蒼頭北行，以申前好。豈知瑜父不以生為念，終無一言以及親事，但厚賂以饋生耳。蒼頭臨行之際，瑜乃以箋付之，令持以獻生。
　　一日，蒼頭抵家復命，具言以結盟符氏，生心大恚。復聞瑜有書奉寄，生大喜，拆而視之，乃情札一紙，並詩十韻。生讀之，歎曰：「清才麗句，雖李易安、朱淑真不過是也。」書曰：
　　「妾瑜，蓋嘗因親致親，雖有慚於聖訓，以愛結愛，豈有負於初心？敬陳悃　之誠，上達高明之聽。伏念妾瑜三才末品、一介女流，愧無傾國傾城之姿，且有至愚至陋之累。叨蒙不棄，肯結契緣；復感納聘，重申結好。感恩有日，報德無由。豈期凶變於門，山崩水竭，遂使魚沉湘水，雁杳衡陽。一別悠然，三年在邇。寸心千里，眼窮雲海之微芒；一日三秋，腸斷光陰之轉遞。前言難踐，後會何時？風風雨雨不曾停，悶悶愁愁何日了！罄南山之竹簡，寫意無窮；決東海之洪波，流情不已。愁如雲而常聚，淚若水以難乾。春苑花開，悵滿豔陽之景；夏涼燕乳，情嗟長養之天秋觀明月倍傷神，冬玩香梅增感慨。警於心，觸於目，無非惆悵之時；俯乎人，仰乎天，盡是相思之處。一心怏怏，兩淚汪汪。一日十二時，時時悵望；五更三四點，點點生愁。坐如屍，立如齋，形同枯木；瞻在前，忽在後，目若紫芝。簪折瓶沉，月下已幸向日約；香消玉減，鏡中無復舊時容。密約成虛，怕過舊時游處；歡娛陳跡，難斯後會何時。深懷千言萬語，與誰說浼；決盡一心一意，惟子是從。願若果乖，雖生無益；情如不遂，便死何妨！凱拋彩鳳文鸞，去遂山雞野鷺？父縱許盟於異姓，妾肯委質於他人？誓於此生，靡敢失節，皇天后土，實所鑒臨！碧落黃泉，要同一處。天作比翼鳥，地成連理枝，允副王郎之願；生為同室親，死為同穴鬼，毋為居易之言。趙璧重完，尚希躬往；樂鏡再合，早致良圖姑共挽桓君之車，庶免抱淑真之恨。償足死生之債，莫負錙銖；未終龜鶴之齡，長堅金石。誠能如此，妾雖垂首九原之下，亦且甘心矣。惟兄是圖之，毋使落他人之手也。臨書腸斷，不知所云。更有平日所作鄙句，並用奉呈：
　　朝朝暮暮憶崔徽，鬢霧蓬鬆淚兩垂。蠶繭絲何日了，鷺鷥骨瘦幾時肥！西廂待月人何？在北裡鏘鸞事已違。腸斷畫梁雙紫燕，飛來飛去又飛歸。
　　相思相望淚頻傾，欲化雲娘恨未能。簾外厭聞無喜鵲，窗前愁伴有心燈。千般嬌媚何在？一種風流病又增。可惜佳斯成阻隔，愁愁悶悶幾層層。
　　紅顏薄命古今同，不怨蒼天只怨儂。松柏歲寒終不改，鴛鴦頸白也相從。要知趙客終完璧，莫學陳王只賦龍。今日西廂門下過，汪汪雨淚灑西風。
　　鸞風分群失一友，朝思暮憶倍淒涼。當時何啻魚游水，今日方成參與商。流淚淚流流盡淚，斷腸腸斷斷無腸。風流有債難償子，獨對西風歎幾場。
　　平生志願未能酬，百歲姻緣一旦休。兩股釵分誠有日，一根簪折整無由。愁攢眉上鉛難盡，淚落牀頭枕欲浮。倘若情緣中道絕，微軀此外復何求。
　　寂寂深閨盡日閒，傷情無語倚欄杆。恨從別後生千種，愁擁心頭結一團。藕斷也知絲不斷，燭乾信是淚難乾。他時若落庸夫手，璧碎珠沉也不難。
　　雨打梨花倍寂寥，幾迴腸斷淚珠拋。睽違一載更三載，情緒千條有萬條。好句每從愁裡得，離魂多自夢中消。香羅重解知何日，辜負巫山幾暮朝。
　　兩地相思各一天，可憐辜負月團圓。每盟金石堅孤節，生怕紅塵隨俗緣。鸞鳥柔腸雖斷盡，鮫綃鮮血尚依然。花開月白人何處，無奈千愁萬恨牽。
　　濁紙鮮鮮染淚紅，遙傳長恨寄匆匆。須知身在情終在，務要生同死亦同。蘇雁影沉傳去後，秦簫聲斷月明中。雲收雨散知何處，目斷巫山十二峰。
　　如此鍾情世所稀，這般心事有誰知？丁香到死香猶在，竹節經霜節不移。有意有心常悵望，無言無語但呆癡，碧梧翠竹無由見，一日思君十二時。」
　　生得書後，遂整飭再尋舊約，奈何秋闈在邇，有司催逼赴試急，生不得已，即時回學溫習舊業。與友人數輩，雖朝夕同學共榻，然而思慕瑜娘之心無時不然。他不暇及，集古人詩句十首，以思瑜焉：
　　豈是丹台歸路遙，月魂潛斷不勝招。何因得薦陽台夢，幾度難尋織女橋。慘慘淒淒仍滴滴，霏霏沸沸又迢迢；砌成此恨無量處，縱得春風亦不消。
　　丈夫身上淚沾襟，書盡誰憐得苦吟。紫府有緣同羽化，瑤台無路可追尋。能消造化許多力，不受塵埃半點侵。惟有當時端正月，只應常照兩人心。
　　花有清香月有陰，斷腸魂夢兩沉沉。才開暖律先偷眼、莫為游蜂便吐心。薄霧浮雲愁永晝，落花流水怨離琴。相思一夜梅花發，夕夢時時到竹林。
　　魚在深淵月在天，魂歸冥漠魄歸泉。相思相見知何日，多病多愁損少年。獨坐獨行還獨立，相憐相愛莫相捐。兩情宛轉如心素，願作鴛鴦不羨仙。
　　擘破雲鬟金鳳凰，離人別處倍堪傷。雙雙瓦雀行書案，兩兩時禽噪夕陽。誰愛風流高格調，我憐真白重寒芳。而今往事誰重省，說與流鶯也斷腸。
　　路隔星河去往難，羅裳不暖午風寒。朱經玉樹三山礻壽，共待天池一水乾。閬苑有書難附鶴，碧桃何處共驂鸞。山長水闊人還遠，春色不由得再看。
　　臨高萬丈日斜西，相望長吟有所思。白雪為肌玉為骨。芙蓉如面柳如眉。鴛鴦被合拋何處，紅葉蛾黃化為遲。獨倚欄杆意難寫，援毫一詠斷腸詩。
　　雲想衣裳花想容，美人千里思無窮。春從流水三分盡，心有靈犀一點通。長樂夢回春寂寂，館娃愁重雨氵蒙。不堪吟罷重回首，更隔巫山幾萬重。
　　寄語麻姑借大鵬，瓊台重密許飛瓊。常疑好事皆虛事，誰識鸞聲似鳳聲。霧鬢雲鬟差玉頸，雲裾月風想娉婷。此時為汝腸肝斷，一片傷心畫不成。
　　月窟孀娥不惜栽，天花冉冉下瑤台。獨教羅鄴能呤畢，曾是劉郎再看來。滿眼春愁無處著，半生懷抱向誰開？此時愁望情多少，一寸相思一寸灰。」
　　詩即成，乃命僕持書報黎，稱「將赴試」，密付前詩，以寄瑜娘。瑜見之，不覺失聲長歎，亦集古詩十首以復生曰：
　　「故園東望路漫漫，泣血悲風翠黛殘；去日漸多未日少，別時容易見時難。春蠶到死絲方盡，滄海揚塵淚始乾。無可奈何花落盡，五更風雨五更寒。
　　玉容寂寞倚欄杆，抱得秦箏不忍看。桂樹參天煙漠漠，月娥霜宿夜漫漫。春花秋月何時了，慕雨朝雲去不還。正是消魂時候也，金爐香燼漏聲殘。
　　殘妝漏眼淚欄杆，睹物傷情死一般。三逕冷香迷曉月，十分消瘦怯春寒。黃花冷落不成豔，青鳥慇懃為探著。天若有情天亦老，可憐辜負月團圓。
　　黃菊枝頭破曉霜，此花不與俗人看。車輪生角心猶轉，蠟炬成灰淚始乾。雲鬢懶梳愁折鳳，曉妝羞對怕臨鸞。故人信斷風箏線，相望長吟淚一團。
　　暑往寒來春復秋，故人別後阻山舟。世間美事難雙得，自古英雄不到頭。荳蔻難消心上恨，丁香空結雨中愁。欲知此後相思處，海色西風十二樓。
　　百歲中來不自由，同君身上屬誰憂。金丹擬注千年貌，仙鶴空成萬古愁。豈有蛟龍曾失水，敢教鸞鳳下妝樓。兩身願托三生夢，幾度高吟寄水流。
　　枯木寒鴉幾夕陽，自從別後減容光。遙看地色連空色，人道無方定有方。披扇當年歎溫嶠，此生何處問劉郎。愁來欲唱相思曲，只恐猿聞也斷腸。
　　天上人間兩渺茫，天涯一望斷人腸。多情不似無情好，塵夢哪如鶴夢長。滄海客歸珠送淚，墜樓人去骨猶香。人生自古誰無死，烈烈轟轟做一場。
　　天涯海角有窮時，此恨綿綿無絕期。明月清風如有待，冷猿秋雁不勝悲。曾聽弄玉人間曲，只許高人個裡知。寂寞日長誰問我，每因風景寄君詩。
　　真成命薄久尋思，獨立滄浪自詠詩。粉面怕遭塵土浼，此心惟有老天知。詩成夜月人何在，花落深宮雁亦悲。今日春風亭上過，寒猿晴鳥逐時啼。」
　寫畢，令僕持報以復。
　　生見瑜詩，歎賞不已，思慕倍常，功名之心如霧之散，眷戀之意若川之流。不覺成疾，勿能言動。旁求良醫，拱手默然，莫知所以。有一後至者，歎曰：「此必害相思之病也，雖盧扁更生，亦莫能施其術誠能遂其懷，不治而自愈矣。」初，生之遇瑜，人莫知之也，至是，聞醫者之言，舉家失措，莫知其由。乃詢諸僕，咸曰：「不知。」詢之　哥，姑以實告。即時命僕亟至臨邑，別以他事詣瑜父，而密以實告祖姑。祖姑得之，竊以言瑜。瑜即解玉戒指一枚並魚箋一幅，以投僕，曰：「食欠之即愈。」僕回抵家，遂以玉戒指磨水，與生飲之，頓覺輕減，稍稍能言。僕乃以瑜娘所與之箋呈上。生拆視之，乃詩一首云：
　　妾即君兮君即妾，君令有恙妾何安。
　　鳳凰倒了連雲翼，松柏須宜保歲寒。
　　當日造端良不易，從今燃尾諒猶難。
　　天應憐憫人辛苦，破月應知自有圓。
　　生覽詩數次，忽覺身健，漸漸病癒。時槐黃在邇，生以病故，天不克赴試，始有重訪舊游之意。
　　又月餘，仍催裝復抵黎室。既至，表叔以生久別，眷待甚厚，廷於宣撫外堂之西廡。生見頗有外之之意，意甚不快，又以瑜娘平昔敬重於生，疑其必有交通，每使瑜弟黎銘伴在。生自念負疾遠來，思欲與瑜一致款曲，留連半月，竟莫能得，悒怏殊深。
　　忽值瑜母壽旦，夜間設席慶壽，生入伴齋，至三更後，遂輕步入瑜房中。瑜正優間，見生前至，相與唏噓，歎息久之。已而，細訴衷湯，論其間阻解盟之事、致病之由，不勝悽慘。言猶未盡，忽聞門外呼喚之聲，生遂含淚而別。臨行之際。瑜謂生曰：「兄姑留此，不數日父親將有遠行。」生曰：「諾。」
　　後數日，黎與子果去。生大喜。即日黃昏，外門未閉，生直至女室，相攜玉手，同至剪燭西窗。生顧窗中詩畫，宛如夢中，無有或異於始謀私奔之約，生深然之。既而，參橫斗落，遂不復寢，乃相送而出。東方漸白，門猶未啟，二人相返於剪燭軒下，此軒遠僻，人跡罕聞，乃制《南宮一枝花》一曲，按琵琶歌贈生。夫瑜平昔善歌恐聞於外，昔時生每強之不得，今請自歌之。生心欣聽，響遏行雲，聲振林木，駭然驚服。詞名《一枝花》，帶過《小梁州》：
　　「春愁豔色中，夏景繁華裡，秋悲霜降後，冬恨雪零時。觸目攢眉，許多情意，心事有誰知？三年裡幾不通，一日間百憂並集。
　　《小梁州》
　　望碧天，茫茫不盡；念青鸞，杳杳無期。可憐辜負深盟誓。玉人何處？招之不至樂昌鏡破，鳳釵雙離。蕭郎簫斷，蔡琰笳悲。怪累朝鳥雀頻啼，喜今宵玉手同攜。《小梁州》，漫把曲兒歌，大都來細把離情訴，聲聲短歎長吁。鍾情到此，悲歡離合都經歷。悵殺我無雙翼，安得雙雙花並蒂、對對鳳于飛？古人言：『在天願作比翼鳥，入地願成連理枝。』這言兒也、君須記。死生隨你。問我何歸，相思而已。」　
　　歌畢，天明，生乃出。瑜遂書前曲，命婢持示生。
　　生制《耍孩兒》一曲，暮春同游，命瑜歌之，生拂弦以和之，並附於此：
　　《耍孩兒》　
　　老天生我非容易，把俺置入花天月地。歡娛正值少年時，況兩人貌美才奇。我便是瓊瑤藏中無雙寶，你便是紫陽場中第一枝。往古誰堪比？冠世才、風流曹子建，傾城色、窈窕太真妃。
　　《五煞》
　　雖二人、只一身，十分佳、一樣齊，根如連理花同蒂。琪花瑤草相暉映，玉蕊金英付護持。誰知得、真情意。博山下深深密約，洞房中悄悄幽期。
　　《四熬》
　　情乍深漸妮親，頭妒交又解攜，回頭間別三年矣。爾思予兩行紅粉淚，予思爾幾句斷腸詩。鱗鴻絕、書難寄。百樣相思端緒，萬般離況情思。
　　《三煞》
　　可勝歎嗟！椿樹倒、痛在心，那堪岸泮嚴束繫。欲重來，奈多修阻不克諧。我的心情，秋冬春夏四時裡，恨怨悲傷四字兒。此無聊不在心，便在眉。令那割人腸的花開月白，那更苦人心的燕語鶯啼。
　　《二煞》　
　　我只道破鏡不圓，誰承望去璧重歸。訴艱辛、一一從頭起耳才聞處腸先斷，口未言時淚早垂。相對幾聲長吁氣：哀哀怨怨，噫噫唏唏。
　　《煞尾》　
　　此意兒重若山，此情兒融似泥。兩人莫負平生志。情黏骨髓刀難割，病入膏肓藥怎醫？任先生死死，要一處相依。
　　《尾聲》　
　　如此如此，永由伊。由伊肯嫁情人，殞身做一個風流鬼。休獨使崔張、卓司馬專美。
　　自是之後，多會於漱玉亭上。
　　次夜，生復至，且約以是月中秋，相與踐東門之約。瑜允之。
　　次日，生將辭歸，適黎亦回，乃設席以待生。酒至半酣，黎起，舉杯謂生曰：「往日時誤結絲蘿，有乖國法，今思改正。且瑜娘，老夫所鍾愛者，不欲外適，恐致相見之難，將求佳婿以贅之。況且子既絆於文林，必歷乎仕路，但與瑜娘相呼為兄妹，不亦宜乎？」生聽其言，唯唯從命。復以紅羅一匹以與生，曰：「勞子遠來，無以為饋，聊以表吾違約之過。子其納之。」生亦受之不辭。宴罷，日暮，生回室，思欲與瑜一會，重申舊約，奈何無間可乘，轉輾反覆，莫能成寢。既曉，瑜乃命碧桃以囉鱗趾一片並近體一首以別生云：
　　間別三年始得逢，才逢數日卻匆匆；
　　一身歸去輕如葉，萬恨生來重似蓬。
　　莫把仙桃輕漏泄，好教雲翼早相從；
　　向來言約君須記，只在中秋一月中。
　　生歸家數日，復往舊約。及至，不復露身，但寓於佃夫之家，陰使老嫗為通情焉。至中秋夜，賞月罷散，俱已醉寢，瑜乃竊開後門走出時生正佇立俟候，忽見瑜至，相與同到寓所。命佃夫抬轎，至海濱。時舟在岸，生乃抱瑜登舟，渡海而東。半月間，始得登岸。其程中所作《八景》，附此：　
　　《蘭房寂寞》　
　　素娥今夜到蟾宮，鶴怨猿悲惆悵中；
　　香冷博山人不見，秋風秋雨泣寒蛩。
　　《花檻蕭條》　
　　繞欄濃豔四時開，都是區區手自栽；
　　此生鶯花誰自主，故園猿鶴不勝哀。
　　《仙門夜月》　
　　慘淡中秋半夜天，相期私出小門前；
　　回首見月顏何厚，步未移時淚已漣。
　　《古道秋風》　
　　野草寒煙望眼荒，秋風颯颯樹蒼蒼；
　　不知此地是何處，怕聽猿聲恐斷腸。
　　《博浦開船》　
　　平生不省出門前，今日飄零到海邊；
　　同駕木蘭從此去，鶴歸華表是何年？
　　《扁舟駕浪》　
　　一葉輕舟鼓浪行，搖搖擺擺幾層層；
　　也知平日優游好，爭奈安從險處成。
　　《孤掉搖風》
　　苦愛風流不肯休，西風吹起浪波流；
　　人言舟裡黃泉近，終日昏昏怕舉頭。
　　《列樓登岸》　
　　沙白茅黃海氣腥，人言此地是豐盈；
　　岸頭舉目非吾土，兩淚汪汪別二親。
　　登岸之際，忽見僕夫在彼俟候，迎瑜歸家。
　　即至，擇日設花燭之會，行合巹之禮。二人交歡之時，不啻若仙降也。乃於枕上共成一詞，以識喜云。詞名《一剪梅》：
　　「金菊花開玉簟秋，鸞下妝樓，鳳下妝樓。新人原是舊交遊，魚水相投，情意相投。舉案齊眉到白頭，千歲綢繆，百歲綢繆。頂香待月舊風流，從此休休，自此休休。」　　
　　自是之後，符氏緝知，具狀詞告於郡。
　　時亻卒郡者由進士出身，博學好事，亦重風情案，聞生之才名、瑜之佳譽，勒生與瑜供狀詞。輅供曰：
　　「伏以不告而娶，固知獲罪於聖門；竊負而逃，未免有乖於國法。雖然有咎，未必無因。謹具狀由，備陳始末。緣念我祖之妹、我父之姑，早適臨高之縣，厥姓曰符，厥官曰土，世居臨邑之鄉。所有孫女，正及可笄之歲；念予小子，先成結誼之盟。自是冰人親斷千金一諾，復兼月老更交禮於雙壁。玉鏡之台，吾已下矣；芙蓉之褥，余得隱焉。詎念人心不測，天地無常，俄焉時候，倏爾云亡。彼海翁遽然易慮，慕彼千金之值，欺予六尺之孤，棄舊好而結新歡，見小利而忘大義。父心母意雖欲更張，女願男情黏滯不了，是以犯在色之戒，通知好之私。日盛月新，膠堅漆固，兩情難捨，百計無由。萬慮千思，惟恐破樂昌之鏡；三更半夜，遂竊效桌氏之逃。自博浦而下船，至烈樓而登岸。艱於山，險於水，始克到家；寄諸東，轉諸西，未遑寧處。冤家有頭債有主，已被告明；官司無黨亦無偏，從公勘審。今蒙喚問，所供是實，得罪惟甘。尚冀審緣由，果孰先而孰後；曲成斯美，俾有始而有終。望大人寬宏法之仁，小子遂宜家之樂。生則仰天而祈禱，死則結草以報恩。不在多言，伏乞台鑒。」
　　瑜娘供狀：
　　「妾瑜告則不得娶，所以悖理而私奔；觀過斯知仁，尚望容情而恕罪。荷申悃　、上瀆高明。伏念瑜父生母育，忝處中閨，師順婉閒，謹訓內則。先時結誼，以締好於辜生；近日解盟，復許親於符氏。欲從乎先進，則不順乎親；欲適乎後人，則有於信是以猶豫而莫決，未知定向以適從，三思於心，兩端互執。出乎此則入乎彼，理勢必然；舍乎利而取乎義，心情方慊。況且符氏粗粗魯魯，孰若辜子　　昂昂，涇渭判然，薰蕕別矣；難離難合，不得不然。所以月下花前，預許偷香之約；更闌人靜，竟為懷璧之逃。駕一葦之仙舟，凌千層之碧浪；渡蓬萊之仙境，抵瓊館之名區。誰想洞房之樂方深，而符氏誣詞已下；枕席之歡未已，而府中胥吏來拘。自作自歡，事已發矣；吐情吐實，伏乞鑒焉。尚冀秦台之鏡照臨，孟母之刀剖析。庶俾一段良緣，始終美滿；免喪三分微命，翕剡雲亡。夫如是，則妾再生之辰也。謹具厥由，詳情乎理。」
　　郡扌卒覽畢，以硃筆判曰：
　　蓋聞《易》備三才，貴陰陽之正義；《詩》稱四始，開男女之及時。《春秋》著謹始之友，經書重大婚之禮。茲乃彝倫之大，實為風化之原。著於理逕昭昭者也；傳諸後世，郁郁乎哉！矧今聖化，人物衣冠之盛，不異中州，尚期媲美於魯鄒，豈意猶存於鄭衛。切照書生辜輅，初知文墨，略涉詩書，況能懷席上之珍，何患無書中之玉？處子瑜娘，生長富華，性質婉娩，何不韞匱藏之寶，待夫善價之沽？處子瑜娘，生長富華，性質婉娩，何不韞匱藏之寶，待夫善價之沽！卻乃逞己私情，污吾淳俗，非獨有違於國法，抑且有叛於聖經。揆諸理而罪固難逃，原其心而情實可恕。再照土官黎稠，蠢小黎蠻，野哉羯者，不能修理幃幕，安能制服黎民？矧令背約欺孤，損貧就富，事由其始，罪所當先。原告符氏，猴頭曾尾，狼子野心，不能揣己自量，卻又奪人匹配。且復捏虛詞誣告，欺誑官司，理既有虧，法當坐罪。牽連之人數，各科斷於本條。嗚呼！一理所存，兩端互執。欲斷地之符氏，恐開爭占之方；欲斷之辜生，慮起淫奔之路。是故度以中正之道，宜歸父母之家。風流案自此打開，陷入坑從今填滿。曠夫怒女，永無間言；債主冤家，大家解結。一惟聖朝之律，深懲蕩俗之非。凡諸後生，當鑒前轍。判語已畢，合屬施行。」　　
　　於是命黎父領之回。
　　先是，二人淹滯囹圄，極情悽慘。乃至判斷明白，將使瑜父領瑜
　　前回，二人相語別曰：「妾與君歷盡危險，備經辛苦，猶不得遂其美滿之情，今日繫於囹圄之門，此人之意惡者也。非緣兄，亦不出此。我父又將領妾遠回，今夜與君於此，不知明日又在何處也。死則已矣，倘若不死，庶毋相忘於患難之中。」二人抱頭大慟，絕而復甦者數次既而，拭淚立會數次，極其綢繆，不覺樵閣日上三竿。女遂自摘其髮繫生之臂，生亦摘髮以繫瑜臂。已而，仰天歎曰：「縱今生不得為同室人，亦當死為同穴鬼；縱有死生之殊，永無違背之異。皇天后土，其證之焉！」瑜乃口《沁園春》一闋，歌以別生。每歌一句，長歎一聲。滿獄聞之，莫不掩泣。歌曰：
　　「夫為妻去，妻為夫死，死又何難？念狼虎叢中，曾經險阻，鑊湯獄裡，受盡辛酸。有口難言，含冤莫訴，碎了心腸爛了肝，愁殺處，見君尤縲泄，我獨生還。
　　恩情萬鍾千般，誓死死生生永不單。這三世冤家無解結，一條性命惜摧殘！生不同衾，死當同穴，付與符氏冷眼看。須記取，綿綿長恨，天上人間。」
　　女別時，生之婢女以酒送瑜。瑜出一簡以付之，使其與生。乃《醉春風》詞一曲：「玉貌減容色，柳腰無氣力。可憐好事到頭非。啾啾唧唧，彩鳳分飛。寶瓶墜井，魂招不得。-------回頭長歎息，血點蓋胸臆。乾坤有盡意無窮，惜惜愁愁，嗟嗟歎歎，相思罔極。」
　　瑜娘既出，生亦疏放，而溺於所愛，恩愈厚而情愈深，終日不食，終夜不寐，癡癡呆呆，如醉如夢，動靜語默，皆思瑜之心形也。其至精神耗損，容有變色，所為之事，旋踵而忘，不知其與荀情崔魄，孰果先而孰後來。嘗作《玉蝴蝶》令一闋云：
　　「憔悴玉人去也，深盟已負，幽怨難招。終日昏昏，無賴無聊。恨如山，重峰疊嶂；悉若線，萬緒千條。想嬌娘，眼波波深恨，旆搖搖難招-------遊魂飛散，金釵脫股，玉帶寬腰。被冷香殘，蘭房寂寂，長夜迢迢。僧金迦，倩誰解結？風流案，何日能消？可憐俏玉人何在，風雨瀟蕭。」　　
　　又詩曰：
　　「臨風長歎息，好事到頭非。一點心難朽，千年願已違。離鸞終日怨，塞雁幾時回？寂寂寒窗下，無言但淚垂。誰想鳳和凰，翻成參與商。燈殘心尚在，燭冷淚還長。當日同司馬，如今似樂昌。相思成痼疾，自覺斷中腸。」
　　瑜娘自歸之後，黎幽之冷室，使之自盡。瑜終日獨自悲吟，欲殞命，然以未得與生決別，尚不能忍，乃作哀詞八首以弔云：
　　「暗室兮寥寥，長夜兮迢迢。欣歡兮今何在，天涯兮亦何遙。愁頻結兮不能消，魂已飛兮不能招。風流債兮償未了，鴛鴦頸兮何時交。
　　妾心兮悲又悲，皇天兮知不知？想思兮此際，相見兮何時？雁兒東去，燕兒西歸，鏡已分兮釵已離。心盟有在兮君應不違，靈神作證兮吾將誰依？在天願作兮比翼鳥，在地願為兮連理枝。天地兮無窮盡，此情兮無絕期。
　　日在兮青天，魚在兮深淵。天與淵兮懸何切，我與君兮合無緣！不怨父兮不怨母，不怨人兮不怨天。但怨紅顏多薄命，倚門長歎淚漣漣。
　　幽室無人兮與鬼交親，微喘苟存兮與鬼為鄰。愁眉兮終日顰，幽恨兮幾時伸。誓此生兮不惜身，即與子兮合其真。生當為兮同室人，死當為兮同穴塵。
　　春風桃李兮今何在，秋雨梧桐兮增感慨。填不平兮美滿坑，償未了兮風流債。香羅重解兮何時，佳期已失兮難再。
　　百年伉儷兮一旦分張，覆水難收兮拳拳盼望。倘若不遂所懷兮死也何妨，正好烈烈轟轟兮便做一場。莫教專美兮待月西廂，何心偃仰兮苦戀時光。
　　樹欲靜兮風不休，梗欲停兮波不流。海縱柘兮心尚在，石雖爛兮情猶存。於今堪歎亦堪悲，無緣佳期不到頭。甘向牡丹花下死，便為情鬼也風流。
　　只為君情兮苦牽纏，遂使今日兮受斯愆。竊負而逃兮真可慊，縲紲而拘兮猶可憐。父兮母兮不相見，只兮弟兮不相捐。與其苟生於人世，孰若飲恨於黃泉！」
　　詞成，黎以公幹之縣，祖姑乃竊開縱瑜潛而出。
　　時生家僕來探訪消息，瑜乃出一簡付之，命遺與生。生拆視之，不覺放聲大哭。其書曰：
　　「妾與君自交會以來，殆始四載於斯矣。吾兄使妾眷戀之心始終弗替，綢繆之意生死弗改。瑜月下之盟，口血猶未乾也；燈前之語，德音尚在耳也。妾拳拳是念，切切惟思，未嘗一日而去懷，惟冀與子偕老而已。曩者中秋之行，始得遂志，自謂可以馴至百年而不負，燈前月下之心遂矣。奈何無知惡小切齒，在州構成官訟，遂至釵分鏡破，簪折瓶沉。父母惡之，鄉人賤之，臭穢彰聞，閨門駢笑，良可悲夫！妾今幽居別室，風月不通。正欲自盡也，則恐自經溝瀆，人莫知之；正欲苟存也，則將何面目去見父母？是以猶豫未決，思欲與子一訣而後捐身也。嗚呼！百年伉儷，一旦分張；千載佳期，時難再得。想迎風待月之時，握雨攜雲之會，其可得乎？吁！不可得也。此妾之所以長歎深悲者也，所以飲恨長逝者也。妾所以作哀詞錄之以奉呈焉，以表生死不忘之志。瑜泣血謹書。」
　　生覽畢，忽焉如有所失，乃作《嗟嗟鳳侶》六章以自廣云：
　　「嗟嗟鳳侶，在天一方。思之不見，我心孔傷。
　　嗟嗟鳳侶，在天一涯。思之不見，我心孔悲。
　　嗟嗟鳳侶，非梧不棲。胡為乎哉，一東一西。
　　嗟嗟鳳侶，非竹不食。胡為乎哉，一南一北。
　　嗟嗟鳳侶，遭幽囚兮。一日不見，如三秋兮。
　　嗟嗟鳳侶，落樊籠兮。一日不見，如三秋兮，使我心忡忡兮。」
　　生即日促裝兼道而行，直抵黎之左右潛居焉。使人以密告祖姑。祖姑密以告瑜。瑜聞生至，思得一見而無由，乃作《首尾吟》二律以饋生云：
　　「生不從兮死亦從，天長地久恨無窮----玉繩未上瓶先墜，全軫初調曲已終----烈女有心終化石，鮫人何術更乘風？拳拳致祝無他意，生不相從死亦從。
　　生不相從死亦從，吁嗟好事轉頭空。睽違已似河邊柳，偶得全憑塞上翁。幽香未消幽恨結，此身雖異此心同。拳拳致祝無他意，生不相從死亦從。」
　　辜生是日又得此詩，越加憂慘。知瑜以死相許也，乃溺恨燥腸作賦，名曰《鍾情》，密以饋女云：
　　「予自與卿交合之後，悲歡離合，莫不備經。然後知吾二人鍾情之至，亙古至今，天上人間所未有者也。自前寓此，倉卒並日，埋身晦跡，一月餘矣。思與子一會，以敘往昔之好，以成往昔之盟，以諧往日之願，以踐往日之言，不可復得，可勝歎哉！近得子所作《首尾吟》二律，感傷悲慼，怨恨悽慘，且以見吾子之無二志矣。讀之再三，感之不已。嗚呼！不知何時復得相見也。茲不揆愚魯，強寫情懷，作成鄙賦一篇，名曰《鍾情》。夫情所鍾者，皆吾與子經歷之所履也，不待贅言已可知矣，然未有不因言而見心者也。吁！韓子所謂『物不得其平則鳴』，豈虛語哉！今因人便，敬述謬作以寄吾子，希吾子其彩子。雖然，文華雖工，無補於事，要在踐言耳。同生死人辜輅拜獻賦曰：
　　心動為情，與生俱生。蘊之而為至中之德，發之而為至和之聲。至微至妙，惟純惟精。因乎萬物之感，故有二者之名。歎夫人之所稟雖同，我之所鍾獨異。非憂懼之切心，匪愛惡之介意。杳杳焉莫究其由，茫茫焉莫窺其際。但見感乎物，應乎中，觸於目，著於躬。乾旋坤轉，吾情之無窮也；日往用來，吾情之交通也；春風和氣，吾情之衝融也；驟雨濃去，吾情之朦朧也；淚之灑然，氣之噓然，吾情之所以如山如峰也。然一身之有限，而萬狀之無涯。既而樂之，樂忽變而哀，情之所鍾，為何如哉！察其所由，源源而來。想其月明風清，寂無人聲；蘭啟矣。情人止矣。爾乃一氣潛消，兩情不已；貫兩玉而一串，洽兩身而一體。歲羽歲羽　焉焉猗猗焉，不啻乎鳳之和鳴、枝之連理也。雖文蕭之絆彩鸞、三郎之幸妃子，天下鍾情之樂，又豈加於此哉！至若子規聲若秋閨夜雨，人既歸兮，臂既解兮，爾乃恨結於心，愁塞於眉、嗟赤繩之緣薄，歎鱗雁之音稀，肅肅焉，切切焉，奚啻乎雁之失群鸞之分飛也。雖溺愛之荀情、多情之崔魄，天下鍾情之苦，又豈有加於此哉！鳴呼！噫嘻！吾之與之，交情之至，此於此矣！　粉牆，游洞房，待月明，竊仙香，趕雲雨之幽會，期天地而長久，此情之鍾於樂之一也。及其辭閬苑，歸瓊館，赴月之流邁，傷春景之不返，此情之鍾而為若之一也及至久別而相逢，久窒而復通，攜琴以遂相如，舉案以待梁鴻，此又情之鍾而為若之一也。詎意事發入於公門，身居於囹圄，埋尤劍於獄中，分明鏡於江滸，此又情之所鍾而為苦之一也，情兮情兮，鍾情立此當何如！樂極衰生，言既不虛；苦盡甘來，方豈我誣？悼往者之不可救，念來者之猶可圖。望趙卿之返璧期合浦之珠還哲此心兮，生死不殊；誓此情兮，生死不逾；身雖異處，情非二途。卿其我乎？我其卿乎？鍾情這賦，止於如斯，復何言之可言　仍從而歌之曰：乾坤易盡兮，情不可極。雲霧可消兮，情難釋江海可量兮，情難測。情之起，先天地無地無始。情之穹後天地無終。微此人兮，吾誰與同？微此情兮，吾何以。」
　　瑜覽賦畢，不覺失聲大哭。既而，援筆修書一覽以答生云：
　　同生死人妾瑜試淚含涕，謹布心聲，特令便人代為申達微意，以瀆情人辜兄：妾惟悲歡相繼，雖事勢之必然，生死同途，人情之至原。皇上后土，鑒一生無二之心；霜竹雪梅，乘萬古不移之節。春情如海，永不枯乾；盟誓若山，何由轉動。但惹---短短，特在人亡，空垂首於九原，枉分身於兩處，為此悲耳，豈不哀哉！妾今在幽房，何殊地獄。吞聲哽咽，絕如泣血之子規，顧影悲吟，恰似失群之孤雁。欲苟延性會，親卻不後；將殞滅生身區兄又不至。傷心積恨，豈止一端：殘喘微軀，惟欠一死，感兄不棄，幸輕百里而來詢：嗟妾無緣，不得一朝而朝見室邇人遐懷恨焉；月缺花殘，實可傷也。近得情書飛墜，華翰傅來，別亮新奇，淒涼慘切，備盡悲歡離合之狀，極夫風流慷慨之言。蹙額開緘，含淚披讀，泄胸中之苦趣，開筆下之陳言。奈何紙短情長，未免言窮意並，伏乞採之，實為幸也。」　　
　　黎歸，聞其母縱瑜，大怒，愈加禁錮，節其飲食。生潛往月餘，不通其消息，愈加憂快。然賴祖姑時加問，且命生姑留於此，因便竊　發。
　　又月餘，值黎岳父之誕辰，黎偕其妻俱往之外氏。是夜，祖姑乃穴牆縱瑜而出，命佃人舁之，隨生東歸。
　　數日至家，再設花燭之宴，重誓山海之盟。生乃命婢把酒，與瑜共飲。歡甚，生口占一絕以侑女云：
　　經霜松柏愈森森，足見平生鐵石心；
　　今夜燈前一杯酒，故人端為故人斟。
　　瑜接卮，亦吟一絕以答生云：
　　經霜松柏愈蒼蒼，足見平生鐵石腸；
　　今夜燈前一杯酒，故人端為故人嘗。
　　瑜復酌酒，再酬生云：
　　經霜松柏愈班班，足見平生鐵石肝；
　　今夜燈前一杯酒，故人端為故人談。
　　瑜接卮，亦吟以復云：
　　經霜松柏愈青青，足見平生鐵石盟；
　　今夜燈前一杯酒，故人端為故人傾。
　　瑜歸之後，祖姑乘間勸黎，因許瑜歸寧。祖姑密使人報生如，夫妻遂備禮起行。既至，俯伏請罪。居月餘方歸。
　　瑜娘孝敬其姑，恭順其夫，待姊妹以和友為先，遇僕婢以恩惠為本。一家內外，無不敬之。機杼之精，剪制之巧，為一時之冠，時譽翕然稱之。暇日，則與生吟詠。厥後生掇巍科，偕老百年，永終天命。
　　玉峰主人與生交契甚篤，一旦以所經事跡、舊作詩詞備錄付予，今為之作傳焉。既成，乃為之贊曰：
　　偉哉辜生！卓冠群英，玉質金聲。懿哉瑜娘！秀出群芳，國色天香。日秀日芳。今古無雙。可羨可嘉，千載奇逢。意密情濃，成始成終。洋洋美譽，流播鄉閭，莫不曰善。斯色斯才，生我瓊台，猗歟休哉。玉峰主人，筆力通神，相像寫真，作此傳讓，傳之天涯。」
　　玉峰主人慶生詩：
　　幾回離合幾悲歡，如此鍾情世所難；
　　雪凍不催松落落，飛蛾難掩月團團。
　　豐城龍劍分終會，合浦明珠去又還；
　　從此玄霜俱用盡，好將詩句詠關關。
　　俟軒陳隱公詩：
　　好將詩句詠關關，青鳥何妨再探看；
　　無可奈何風大急，似曾相識月團團。
　　畫蛇笑彼安蛇足，失馬知君得馬還；
　　好把風流收拾起，早攜書劍上長安。
　　玉峰主人結：
　　早攜書劍上長安，莫戀人家歲月長；
　　金榜題名千古舊，布衣換卻錦衣還。
　　張於湖傳　
　　宋朝淮西和州涇陽縣，有一秀才，姓張，名孝祥，字安谷，號於湖。腹中背記五車書，胸內包藏千古史。因戀新婚，不赴科第。其父作詩以誡之，云：
　　西風颯颯逼槐黃，文士紛紛赴選場；
　　休戀鳳衾鴛被暖，桂花香似麝蘭香。
　　於湖見詩，遂上京應舉。幸喜高登，除授江西臨江縣尹。在任一清如水，四民咸仰。一日餘閒，往臨江亭觀玩。但見山青水秀，景物鮮明。見正面屏風畫著瀟湘八景，左壁「范蠡歸湖」，右壁「子房歸山」。攸攸之樂，猛然觸心，遂於壁上題詩一首云：
　　洞庭潮送客，景物晚煙籠；
　　雨過山嵐靜，潮回港艤通。
　　北去搜千疊，南來轉萬蓬；
　　不欲趨潮去，江邊學釣翁。
　　題畢，歸衙。
　　後不覺日月如梭，三年任滿，越升州通判。未任一年，改升金陵建康府尹。帶領伴僕王安，僱船前去。
　　來到揚子江，過金山寺，見十數人駕快船一隻，問云：「來船莫不是建康府尹張爺爺的麼？」於湖叫王安答道：「只說不是。」王安依言回答。那接官公人去了。王安問曰：「相公因何不要公人跟隨入城？」於湖曰：「他們跟著，不得閒行遊玩。且同你入城尋親訪友，茶坊酒肆，勾欄寺觀，俱以遊玩，方可理任。」　
　　來到通江橋邊，時八月天氣，尚且炎熱。於湖吩咐王安：「上岸尋個寺觀，燒湯洗浴。」王安行無半里，見一座道觀，向前與門公唱喏，曰：「我官人行船辛苦，欲借浴堂洗澡，未知允否？」門公曰：「待小人與觀主說知，然後請進。」門公告知觀主。觀主曰：「天氣炎熱，洗浴何妨。」傳語請入。
　　王安報知於湖。於湖即入軒前與觀主相見。但見觀主頭戴星冠，身披鶴氅，人物清標，丰姿伶俐。於湖暗忖曰：「不知來到此間，得遇此觀主恁般風韻。」遂調《西江月》詞一闋，單道觀主妙處：
　　「半舊鞋兒著穩，重糊紙搧風多。隔年煮酒味偏濃，雨過天桃色重。強距公雞快鬥，尾長山雉梟雄。燒殘銀燭燄頭紅，半老佳人可共。」
　　吟畢，與觀主分賓主而坐，觀主問曰：「尊官何處？高姓大名？因什到此？」於湖曰：「小生洛陽人氏，姓何，名通甫。遊玩至此，天氣炎熱，致到上宮，借求一浴。請問觀主高姓？貴壽？」觀主答曰：「貧道在俗姓潘，年四十有八，諱名法成。」正說之間，簾櫳響處，只見一人俄然而入，頭戴七星冠，身披紫霞服，皂絲縧，紅　履，約有二十餘歲，顏色如三十三天天上王女臨凡世，精神似八十一洞洞中仙女下瑤池。生得丰姿伶俐，冠乎天成。於湖一見，蕩卻三魂，散了七魄。觀主令她進前，稽首施禮華，佇立一旁，啟唇問曰：「官宰高姓？」於湖曰：「姓何，名通甫。」那道姑曰：「小道事冗，不及陪奉。」稽首而去。於湖曰：「好個佳人，可惜做了道姑。」又問觀主曰：「適間來者是何院觀主？」曰：「就是敝觀知客。」　
　　正問之間，只見小童請相公沐浴。於湖至浴堂浴罷，到客房梳篦整冠。值門公在側，便問：「門公多少年紀？」門公曰：「小人今年六十二歲。」於湖曰：「你在此幾年？」門公曰：「有二十餘年。」於湖又問曰：「你身上衣服，誰管你的？」門公曰：「小人但得三餐足矣。衣服有無，隨時過日。」於湖謂王安曰：「你去船中取布一匹，賜與門公做衣服穿。」王安取與門公。門公拜謝。於湖就問門公曰：「方才鶴軒相見，姓名什麼？哪裡人氏？今年幾何？」門公曰：「姓陳，名妙常，今年二十三歲，金陵建康府人氏。」於湖曰：「她的宿房在哪裡？」門公曰：「在東廊第一間便是。」言未己，被女童來請相公晚齋撞散。
　　於湖到鶴軒相見，謂觀主曰：「蒙容洗浴，又賜晚齋，何以克當？生之舟中炎熱，故假館借宿一宵，來日便行，自當拜謝。」觀主曰：「無妨。如若未行，寬住幾日。」　
　　當晚齋罷，於湖閒步東廊之下，明月如晝，吟詩一首：
　　浩蕩偏宜八月秋，蟾光皎潔照諸州；
　　誰家寶鏡新磨出，掛在長空忘卻收？　　
　　閒行之間，聽得琴聲響亮，見座黑門樓半開，挨身而入。見十餘個道姑盤環而坐，知客中坐撫琴。於湖歎曰：「此女正是鳳凰入雞伴，難以類比。」正看之際，忽然琴弦已斷。知客曰：「莫不是有人盜聽吾琴？」於湖慌忙而轉身，言曰：「何年日月，再逢此女，吾願足知。」遂題詩一首於粉壁，以歎其美：
　　星斗當天月正圓，忽聞窗畔理琴弦；
　　瑤池降下真仙子，看罷教為獨慘然。
　　尾後書「洛陽才子何通甫題」。題畢，回房歇息。
　　次早，門公來請早齋。齋罷，卻待收拾起程，只見門公報曰：「知客有請。」於湖即至知客房中，分賓主而坐。茶罷，知客曰：「夜來軒中有失迎迓。」於湖曰：「冒瀆多端，不罪幸矣。」觀見壁上有詩，而讀曰：
　　曉日瑤台夜氣清，天風吹落步雲聲。
　　塵根未盡俗緣在，千里關山月正明。
　　於湖讀罷，問曰：「此詩何人所作？」知客答曰：「昔漢光武游王母宮，見仙妃在彼，數日撫琴，故作此詩。第一曰，是非之心，人皆有之，故作『天風吹落步雲聲』。」於湖暗忖：「十分人物，寫作俱高，有十二分奇妙。」知客曰：「小道今日上殿回來，見壁間題有佳作，重蒙過獎。」於湖曰：「小生衝撞貴寓，竊聽琴音，回房亂道《臨江仙》小詞以奉。」知客拆開讀之曰：
　　「誤入蓬萊仙洞裡，松陰忽睹數嬋娟。眾中一個最堪憐。瑤琴橫膝上，共坐飲霞觴。雲鎖洞房歸去晚，月華冷氣侵高堂。覺來猶自惜餘香。有心歸洛浦，無計到巫山。」
　　知客看罷，忖曰：「正是引賊入寨。」於湖曰：「休要見笑。」知客曰：「重蒙所賜，又好笑，又好惱，小道意欲答相公，勿罪。」於湖曰：「小生誠為拋磚引玉耳。乞見教。」知客落筆即寫《楊柳枝詞》一闋云：
　　「襄王魂夢雲雨期，兩心癡，子今無計戀瓊姬，自著迷。道心堅似絮沾泥，不往飛。任取楊枝作柳枝，強挨屍。」
　　寫罷，於湖觀看，大笑。知客曰：「斑門弄斧，幸勿哂焉。」於湖曰：「誠所謂人才雙全，非世之常出也。」然於湖看畢，亦作《楊柳枝》詞以奉云：
　　「碧玉冠簪金縷衣，雪如肌。從今休去說西施，怎如伊。杏臉桃腮不傅粉，最偏宜。好對眉兒好眼兒，覷人遲。」　　
　　寫畢，知客觀見，不語，亦作前詞以答：
　　「清淨堂前不捲簾，景幽然。閒花野草漫連天，莫胡言。獨坐黃昏誰是伴？一爐煙。閒來窗下理琴弦，小神仙。」
　　於湖看畢，即忙起身。知客曰：「言詞冒犯，宥非為幸。」於湖謝別，到船中叫王安取絹一匹，送至觀中，謝了觀主。進城上任理事。
　　那陳妙常懊恨不及，從此惹起凡心，常有思念之意。不覺又是十月初一日，本觀設齋，會集眾道姑，道姑齊來與觀主稽首。正問答間，門公報曰：「外有一秀才，言稱和州涇陽縣人，姓潘，要見觀主。」觀主曰：「請他進來。」門公出去，引到鶴軒相見。觀主問曰：「姪兒幾時到此？」那潘必正拜了四拜，退而言曰：「列位姑姑，就此相見。」眾道姑還禮，俱各請坐。觀主與眾道姑曰：「這是我姪兒潘必正也。從家而來，家眷安否？」必正曰：「俱各平安，有書在此。」觀主曰：「幾時離家？」必正曰：「舊歲十二月離家，正月到京應舉，二月初九頭場過了，忽然患病，未得終場。待欲回家，奈有書在此，未及下得，所以特來拜見。」觀主曰：「行李在何處？」必正曰：「在船上。」觀主曰：「你與門公去搬上來，住數日，另討船回去。」必正同門公將行李搬至觀中。觀主叫女童灑掃後房，與必正安歇。
　　次早，必正到各道姑房裡相訪訖。閒坐之間，問門公姓名。門公曰：「小人姓戚，名中立。」必正又問曰：「東廊盡頭那個道姑，姑什名誰？」門公曰：「姓陳，名妙常。吟詩作賦，撫琴誦經，無有不能。」必正
　　曰：「曾有秀才過客與她賡和否？」戚公曰：曾有外客人，姓何名通甫，號為洛陽才子。是我引他見妙常，將布一匹，送與小人。」必正即將綿纟由海青一件與他，又吩咐曰：「休對人說我將衣服送你。」戚公謝曰：「小人謹領。」必正就調一個《相見楊柳詞》封了，令門公送與知客。
　　門公見妙常曰：「潘官人特來相訪。」妙常微笑曰：「在哪裡？請進。」必正向前施禮，分賓主而坐。茶罷，必正曰「適間小生送一柬，奉呈叱覽，孔幸。」妙常讀曰：
　　「傍觀道觀過茅屋，驚人目。星冠珠履逍遙服，能妝束。絕世儀容瓊姬態，傾城國。淡妝全無半點俗，荊山玉。」
　　妙常看畢，驚曰：「此人言詞典雅，字若龍蛇，況兼人物厚重，比那何家大不同。」妙常曰：「多承佳句。請問官人青春有幾？」必正曰：「二十有五。」又曰：「哪月壽旦？」必正曰：「八月十三。」妙常曰：「官人是大。」必正曰：「知客是幾時壽旦？」妙常曰：「目下不遠。」　
　　正說之間，小童來請，曰：「觀主有請。」必正即回。見了觀主，觀主問曰：「你這幾日身體如何？」必正曰：「托庇苟安。」觀主曰：「小心住一程回去。」必正曰：「以是攪擾姑娘。」茶罷，相別。
　　到房中，自思曰：「回心甚急，奈被此人勾住，又得姑娘相留。」十分喜悅，就在房中撫琴。陳妙常在花園聽，曰：「此曲乃《鳳求凰》也。」暗暗喝采而回。
　　次日，妙常使女童來請必正吃茶。必正即到房內，依次而坐。茶罷，妙常將琴放在几上，燒炷好香，打個稽首，請必正撫琴。必正曰：「不能。」妙常曰：「何故太謙？」觀主曰：「必正先撫一曲，然後知客亦撫。」撫畢，各自散了。
　　自此，往來半月。一日，必正走到妙常房中。女童曰：「官人請坐。」必正曰：「師父何在？」女童曰：「去石城長春院訪一觀主，未回。」必正見書廚未鎖，開拿一部《通鑑》來看。內有一帖，見了大驚，去了三魂，蕩了七魄。讀曰：
　　「松院青燈閃閃，芸窗鐘鼓沉沉。黃昏獨自展孤衾，欲睡先愁不穩。一念靜中思動，遍身慾火難禁，強將津唾咽凡心，爭奈凡心轉盛。」
　　必正曰：「此是凡胎俗骨，何苦出家，有此怨意？不若乘機嘲戲，她若不從，卻有招詞在此。」亦寫《西江月》一首云：
　　「玉貌何須傅粉，仙花豈類凡花。終朝只去戀黃芽，不顧星前月下。冠上星簪北斗，案頭經誦《南華》。未知何日到仙家，曾許彩鸞同跨。」
　　寫畢，放在硯匣底下，露些紙角出來。把《通鑑》安頓了，卻待轉身，妙常回來，與必正相見，敘禮坐定。必正問曰：「何來？」妙常曰：「長春院觀主患病，去訪，留吃中飯。有失相迓。敢問潘官人中膳否？」必正曰：「正欲回房吃飯。」妙常曰：「寬坐，取琴來請教一曲。」取琴安兒，見硯匣下一簡，拿出觀看。此時柳眉剔起，星眼圓睜，叫道：「好也!好也!潘必正，是何道理!此間是清淨道場，祝聖之所，寫什淫詞豔曲，調戲良人!先到觀主處說明，再到官府處定奪!」必正雙膝跪下，曰：「望師兄高抬貴手，一時狂興，誤寫此詞，伏乞恕罪!」妙常曰：「你是讀書之人，此理難容!定要與觀主說知，再不許上我門來!」必正曰：「自古道『有風不可使盡帆。』有應即對，有問即答。」妙常曰：「我有什言詞許你？」必正曰：「『強將津唾咽凡心，爭奈凡心轉盛。』斯言果何謂耶？」妙常回嗔作喜，曰：「從何而來？」必正曰：「在我袖中。」妙常用手來取，卻被必正抱住，曰：「同到你觀主處說明，卻送官司定奪。」妙常陪笑曰：「罷了，落在你手中。」眉來眼去，情興如火。必正曰：「且將這兩個女童如何發落？」妙常就叫兩個女童送一幅素絹與長春院觀主，這兩個女童去了。
　　必正妙常乃攜手同入蘭房。必正曰：「死生不忘卿恩。」妙常曰：「你莫比等閒看，我身猶處子，並無點泄。」卸下星冠，脫下衣服，取一幅白香綾帕，親手取紅。必正見了，心中大喜。妙常曰：「潘郎，這是五百年前結了這段姻緣，今日交付與君，休使賤妾有白頭之歎。」交會間，恰似鴛鴦戲水，渾如鸞鳳穿花。喜孜孜連理共枝，美甘甘同心結蒂。恰恰鶯聲，不離耳畔；喃喃燕語，甜吐舌頭。楊柳腰，點點春濃；櫻桃口，微微氣喘。星眼朦朧，細細汗流香玉體；酥胸蕩蕩，涓涓露滴牡丹心。真合美愛色情多，怎比偷香滋味別。又有一篇《南鄉子》詞單道日間雲雨。詞曰：
　　「情興兩和諧，摟定香肩臉貼腮。手摸酥胸軟似綿，美奇哉裉了褲兒脫繡鞋。玉體著郎懷，舌送丁香口便開。倒鳳顛鸞雲雨罷，多情今夜千萬早些來。」
　　雲雨罷，起，妙常帶了冠子，問曰：「還是帶冠子好，不帶冠子好？」必正遂作《鷓鴣天》一闋云：
　　「卸下星冠睹玉容，宛如神女下巫峰。霎時雲雨歡娛罷，無限恩情兩意濃。輕摟抱，款相從，時間一度一春風。若還得遂平生願，盡在今宵一夢中」。
　　妙常看罷，曰：「今夜不許你再來。我要上殿誦經，不可污了身體。」必正曰：「總不如錦帳歡娛，便是非常之樂。」妙常曰：「不要閒說。」必正遂出一聯，與妙常對云：
　　霎時雲雨，難同徹夜之歡娛。
　　妙常對云：
　　半晌恩情，怎比通宵之快樂。
　　必正曰：「承蒙不阻，犬馬不能報也。今夜莫上殿罷。」妙常曰：「待我上殿回來，你房正連著我房，晚間掇梯從牆上過來，使觀主不疑。」必正歡喜無限，吟詩一首云：
　　一見仙容不下懷，愁眉深鎖幾曾開？　
　　多蒙窈窕慇懃意，暮暮朝朝暗約來。
寫畢，妙常看罷，大怒，回詩一首：
　　君還欲我隔千山，我欲還君彈指間；
　　今日與君成配偶，莫將容易意闌珊。
　　必正曰：「承蒙師兄佳意，我輩如何發遣？」妙常回嗔作喜，曰：「自今為始，以夫婦敘禮，不許以師兄稱。」正說之間，女童回來，阻生。必正作別回房。
　　次早，見姑娘。姑娘曰：「姪兒身體如何？」必正曰：「稍安。」辭別回房，坐定，自思：「妙常生得十分人物，寫作俱高。」正欲掇梯過牆，只見日色未落，不得到晚，口吟一詩云：
　　紅輪何苦不銜山？佇立階前幾度看。
　　但得疏星三四點，免教仙子候花間。
　　吟畢，只聞樓頭鼓擂，寺內鐘鳴，眾道姑上殿各散，回房睡了。必正關了房門，正欲掇梯過牆之際，只聽得隔牆叫一聲，「潘必正!」叫者是何人？　　
　　花面金剛，玉體魔王。綺羅織就豺狼。法場斗帳，牢獄牙牀。柳眉刀，星眼劍，絳唇槍。口美香舌，蛇蠍心腸。共他者，無不遭殃。纖塵落水，片雪投湯。秦是強，吳越比，也為他亡。早知色是傷人劍，殺盡世人也不妨。
　　必正聽叫，連忙下來，卻是姑娘。姑娘曰：「你哪裡去？」必正曰：「登廁。」姑娘曰：「你彈一曲《鳳友鸞交》與我聽者。」必正即撫。及畢，姑娘去了。
　　必正依舊上牆，陳妙常接著下來，兩個攜手到亭子上，並肩而坐。妙常曰：「你先上牆來了，如何又下去撫琴？」必正曰：「如此，如此。」妙常曰：「早是不曾過來，倘若被她看見，如何是好？」必正看看一座好花園，但見：
　　淡煙籠院宇，薄霧罩池塘。雙雙粉蝶宿花叢，對對游蜂穿柳砌。湖山隱，依稀見座峰尖；池沼汀清，彷彿一天星斗。颯颯金風穿繡幕，團團明月透珠簾。
　　妙常曰：「等你不來，因見湖山石眼透出月光，遂吟一絕云：
　　蟾蜍一線透湖山，斜倚欄杆偷眼看；
　　仰觀斗柄橫三點，心忙移步出花間。
　　必正聽得，大笑曰：「我不能得日落，口吟四句，韻腳一般相同。」妙常曰：「願聞。」必正吟曰：
　　紅輪何苦不銜山，佇立階前幾度看。
　　但見疏星三四點，免教仙子候花間。
　　妙常曰：何斯不約而自同如此？」必正曰：「我與你同心同意，前世分定夫妻。」言罷，二人入房，解衣共寢，覆雨翻云。正是：歡娛嫌夜短，顛鸞倒鳳，猶如粉蝶探花心。歡戲間，不覺天曉。必正仍歸舊路去了。
　　次日，見姑娘。姑娘曰：「吃早飯未？」必正曰：「未曾吃。適來偶見一太醫，看脈，說我身體甚是虛弱，若不用葷腥調理，恐傷性命。」姑娘聽罷，吃了一驚。便叫門公買酒肉果品之類，送在必正房中。必正檢入。
　　到晚，將酒肴與妙常同飲。正是：竹葉穿心過，桃花上臉來；茶為花博士，酒是色媒人。燈光之下，看妙常有傾國傾城之色。口占《菩薩蠻》一闋云：
　　「芸房空鎖傾城色，萬態千嬌誰能及？何幸到鸞幃，春心不自持。點染香羅帕，遂我平生願。此處會雲英，何須上玉京？」　
　　妙常聽罷，亦口占《菩薩蠻》云：
　　「香衾初展芭蕉綠，垂楊枝上流鶯宿。花嫩不禁揉春風卒未休。千金身已破，默默愁眉鎖。密語囑檀郎，人前口謹防。」
　　必正看罷，情興越濃，遂解帶雲雨。及罷，即於枕上說海誓山盟，就中訴深情蜜意。忽聞鄰雞三唱，最怪的曉霞穿碧落，偏嫌的紅日照紗窗。必正披衣起，回。
　　自是之後，約有半年之期。必正一日與妙常閒坐，只見妙常兩眼垂淚，眉頭不展。必正將手帕與妙常試了眼淚，問曰：「因何這等煩惱？」妙常袖裡取出一個帖子，遞與必正，必正看時，卻是《臨江仙》詞一闋，云：
　　「眉似雲開初月，纖纖一搦腰肢。與君相識未多時，不知因個什，裙帶短些兒。茶飯不餐常似病，終朝如醉如癡。此情尤恐外人知，專將心腹事，報與粉郎知。」　　　必正看畢，曰：「既有此事，何不早說？有什難哉!」妙常曰：「我平日在此欺著手下的人，今日做出這醜事，如何是了？只得尋個死路，免污他人耳目。」淚下如雨。必正曰：「但放心懷。待我明日入城，贖一帖
　　墮胎藥。吃了便好。」妙常曰：「我曉得你做個脫身之計，去了不回。我命只在今夜。」必正曰：「若有此心，天地不佑。」　
　　辭別妙常，入到城中。正行間，只見喝道前來，必正避不及，街傍佇立。卻是必正的故友張於湖。於湖一見必正，連叫：「住轎!」與必正相見。邀必正同到府中，分賓主而坐。茶罷，於湖問曰：「行館何處？」必正曰：「在城外女貞觀姑娘處。」於湖曰：「令姑是何人？」必正曰：「是住持潘法成。」於湖曰：「既是此觀，其中有一好物在彼。」必正曰：「兄長何以知之？」於湖曰：「舊歲在彼借水洗浴，曾作《柳枝詞》。」必正曰：「莫不是洛陽才子何通甫的作？」於湖細說，二人大笑。必正亦備言前事。於湖曰：「不難。你捏作指腹為親，為因兵火離隔，欲求完聚，告一紙狀來，我自有道理。」　
　　必正別了於湖，回到觀中，與妙常具說前事。晚間，到姑娘房中，必正雙膝跪下，將妙常之事，說與姑娘。姑娘曰：「我已知文。但不知你肯娶她麼？」心正曰：「小姪願娶。」姑娘曰：「叫她來，問她。」必正叫妙常到房裡，見了姑娘。姑娘曰：「你做得好事!」妙常低頭不語。姑娘曰：「去寫狀子來，明日進城去告。」　
　　次日，三人同到建康府中下狀。當日，三人跪下。太守問曰：「告什麼狀？」觀主人告：「乞還俗事。」太守曰：「捲簾。抬頭。」叫妙常，問曰：「你曾云『清淨堂前不捲簾』？」唬得陳妙常魂不附體。太守曰：「潘必正、陳妙常二人既是指腹為親，各供本身之事。供得明白，准你還俗。」必正供曰：
　　「鄉貫舉人潘必正，伏蒙琴堂判府龍圖侍郎台下：告為結親完娶事。伏聞才愧相如，無挑琴之興；賢同顏子，有秉燭之憂。為因兵火流離，情意懼絕；豈期默然之會，所有前因。各有祖留衫襟之表，幸望仁慈，得配終身，偕老終身。所供是實。」　　
　　女貞觀知客陳妙常供曰：
　　「伏聞生居宦族，乃無謝女之才；長在玄門，叨沐孫姑之德塵根已盡，絕孟光之慕梁鴻；盜緣以再，斷雲英之約裴航。鬧中取靜，打坐看經；忙裡偷閒，尋師講道。豈期百年冤債來尋，況是嚴師力　。今有度牒，係是官文，未敢自專。伏望判府俯察來詞，特賜與決。」　
　　金陵建康府女貞觀道姑潘法成狀供：
　　「本觀女姑陳妙常供，父陳谷英存日，將女妙常曾指腹與潘必正為妻。見有原割衫襟合同為照。為因兵火離散，各無音耗。幸蒙天賜，偶然相會，所說舊日根苗，輻輳姻緣。俱在青春之際，如樂昌破鏡重圓，似文君駕車之願。所有原關度牒在身，未敢自便還俗。恕蒙准告。望乞台判。」　
　　太守看畢，援筆判曰：
　　「道可道，名可名。強名曰道。空即是色，色即是空。清者濁之源，守不住煉藥丹爐；動者靜之機，熬不過凡情慾火。大都未撞著知音，多管是前生注定。拋棄了布袍草履，再穿上翠袖羅裳；收拾起紙帳梅花，準備著羅幃繡幕。無緣處，青浦黃庭消白日；有分時，洞房花燭照乾坤。」　　
　　張於湖判畢，即令還俗。
　　潘必正與陳妙常成親後，於湖舉必正賢良方正，除授蘇州府吳江縣尹。官至禮部侍郎。妙常生一男一女。夫妻衣錦榮歸，盡天年而終。
　　續東窗事犯傳　
　　錦城士人胡生，名迪，性志倜儻，涉獵經史，好善惡惡，出於天性。一日，自酌小軒之中，飲至半酣，啟囊探書而讀。偶得《秦檜東窗傳》，觀未畢，不覺赫然大怒，氣湧如山，擲書於地，拍案高吟曰：
　　「長腳邪臣長舌妻，忍將忠孝苦謀夷。天曹默默緣無報，地府冥冥定有私，黃閣主和千載恨，青衣行酒兩君悲。愚生若得閻羅做，剝此奸臣萬劫皮！　　
朗吟數次，已而就寢。
　　俄見皂衣一人，至前揖曰：「閻君命僕等相招，君宜速往。」生醉間，不知閻君為誰，遂問曰：「閻君何人？猥素昧平生，今而見召，何也？」皂衣人笑曰：「君至則知，不必詳問。」強挽生行。
　　及十餘里，乃荒郊之地，煙雨霏微，如深秋時候。前有城郭，而居人亦稠密，往來貿易者如市廛之狀。既而，入城，則有殿宇崢嶸，朱門高敞，題曰「曜靈之府」，門外守者甚嚴。皂衣者令一人為伴，一人白之。少焉，出，曰：「閻君召子。」生大駭愕，罔知所以，乃移入門。殿上王者袞衣冕旒，類人間祠廟中繪塑神像。左右列神吏六人，綠袍皂履，高幕廣帶，各執文簿。階下侍立五十餘眾，牛頭馬面，有長喙朱髮者，卓立可畏。生稽首階下。王問曰：「子胡迪耶？」生曰：「然。」王怒曰：「子為儒，須讀書習禮，何為怨天怒地，謗鬼侮神乎」生答曰：「賤子後進之流，早習先聖先賢之道，安貧守分，循理修身，未嘗敢怨天尤人，而矧乃侮神謗鬼乎！」王曰：「然則『天曹默默原無報，地府冥冥定有私，之句孰為之邪？」生方悟為怒秦檜之作，再拜謝曰：「賤子酒酣，罔能持性，偶讀奸臣之傳。致吟忿憾之詩，　望神君，特垂寬宥。」王命吏以紙筆令生供款，讓曰：「爾好掉筆頭議論古今人之臧否，若所供有理，則增壽放回，詞意舛訛，則送風刀之獄。」生謝過再四，援筆而供曰：
　　「伏以混沌未分，亦無生而無死；陰陽既判，方有鬼以有神。為桑門傳因果之經，知地獄設輪回之報。善者福而惡者禍，理所當然；直之升而屈之沉，亦非謬矣。蓋賢愚之異類，若幽顯之殊途。是皆不得其平則鳴，匪沽名而釣譽；敢忘非法不道之戒，故懼罪以招愆。出於自然，本自天性。切念某幼讀父書，早有功名之志；長承師訓，慚無經緯之才。非惟弄月管之毫，擬欲插天門之翼。每夙興而夜寐，常窮理以修身。讀孔孟之微言，思舉直而措枉；觀王王圭之確論，愁激濁以揚清。立貞忠欲效松筠，肯衰老甘同蒲柳！天高地厚，深知半世之行藏；日居月諸，洞見一心之妙用。惟尊賢而似寶，第見惡以如仇。視岳飛父子之冤，欲追求而死諍；視秦檜夫妻之惡，便欲死而生吞。因東窗贊擒虎之言，到北狄知無回鑾之望。懼忠臣被屠戮而殘滅，恨賊子受棺槨以全終。天道無知，神明安在？俾奸回生於有幸，令賢哲死於無辜。謗鬼侮神，豈比滑稽之士；好賢惡佞，實非迂闊之儒。是皆至正之心，焉有偏私之意？飲三杯之狂藥，賦八句之鄙吟，雖冒大耳息，誠為小過。惟神鑒之。」
　　王看畢，笑曰：「腐儒倔強乃此。雖然，好善惡惡，固君子之所尚也。至夫『若得閻羅做』，其不毀孰甚焉。汝若為閻羅，將吾置於何地？」生曰：「昔者韓擒虎云：『生為上柱國，死作閻羅王。』又寇萊公江丞相，亦嘗為是任，明載簡冊，班班可考。以此征之，冥君皆世間正人君子之所為也。僕固不敢希韓、寇二公之萬一，而公正之心，頗有二公之毫末耳。」王曰：「若然，冥官有代，而舊者何之？」生曰：「新者既臨，舊者必生人道而為王公大人矣。」王顧左右曰：「此人所言，甚有玄理。惟其狂直若此，苟不令見之，恐終不信善惡之報，而視幽冥之道如風聲水月，無所忌憚矣。」即呼綠衣吏，以一白簡書云：「右仰普掠獄冥官，即啟狴牢，領此儒生遍視報應，毋得違背。」　
　　既而，吏引生之西廊，過後殿三里許，有巨垣，高數仞，以生鐵為門，題曰：「普掠冥司獄。」吏扣門呼之。少焉，夜叉數輩突出，如有擒生之狀。吏叱曰：「此儒生也，無罪。閻君令視善惡之狀。」以白簡與之示焉。夜叉謝生曰：「吾輩以為重罪鬼入獄，不知公為書生也，幸勿見罪。」乃啟關揖生而入，其中廣五十餘里，日光淡淡，冷風蕭然。四維門碑，皆榜名額：東曰「風雷之獄」，南曰「火車之獄」，西曰「金剛之獄」，北曰「冥冷之獄」。男女荷鐵枷者千餘人。又至一小門，則見男子二十餘人，皆被髮裸體，以巨釘釘其手足於鐵牀之上，項荷鐵枷，舉身皆刀杖痕，膿血腥穢，不可近傍。一婦人裳而無衣，罩於鐵籠中，一夜叉以沸湯澆之。綠衣吏指下者三人，謂生曰：「此秦檜父子與萬俟　，此婦人即秦檜之妻王氏也。其他數人，乃忄敦，蔡京父子、耿南仲、丁大全、賈似道，皆其同奸黨惡之徒。王遣吾施陰刑，令君觀之。」即呼鬼卒五十餘眾，驅檜等至風雷之獄。縛於銅柱，一卒以鞭扣其環，即有鋒刀亂至，繞刺其身。檜等體如篩底。良久，雷震一聲，擊其身如齏粉，血流凝地。少焉，惡風盤旋，吹其骨肉，復為人形。吏謂生曰：「此震擊者陰雷也，吹者業風也。」又呼卒驅至金剛、火車、冥冷等獄，各獄將檜等受刑尤甚。饑則食以鐵丸，渴則飲以銅汁。吏曰：「此曹凡三日則遍歷諸獄受諸苦楚。三年之後變為牛、羊、犬、馬，生於凡世，使人烹剝而食其肉。其妻亦為牝豕，與人畜離，食其不潔，亦不免刀烹之苦。今此眾以為畜類於世五十餘次矣。」生問曰：「其罪有限乎？」吏曰：「歷萬劫而無已，豈有限焉！」復引生至西垣一小門，題曰：「奸回之獄。」荷桎梏者百餘人，舉身插刀，渾類猥形。生曰：「此曹何人？」吏曰：「皆是歷代將相，奸回黨惡，欺君罔上，蠹國害民者。每三日。亦與秦檜等同受其刑。三年後，變為畜類，皆同檜也。」復至南垣一小門，題曰「不忠內臣之獄」。內有牝牛數百，皆以鐵索貫鼻，繫於鐵柱，四週以火炙之。生曰：「牛畜類也，何罪而致是耶？」吏曰：「君勿言，姑俟觀之。」即呼獄卒，以巨扇拂火。須臾，烈燄沖天，生皆不勝其苦，哮吼躑躅，皮毛焦爛。不久，大震一聲，皮忽綻裂，突出者皆人觀之，俱無髮髯，悉閹人也。吏呼夜叉致於鑊湯中烹之。已而，皮肉融消，惟存白骨而已。復以冷水沃之，仍復人形。吏謂生曰：「此皆歷代宦官，漢之十常侍，唐之李輔國、仇士良、王守澄、田令孜，宋之閻文應、童貫之徒。曩者長養禁中，錦衣玉食，欺誑人主，妒害忠良，濁亂海內，令受此報，歷萬劫而不原也。」復至東垣，其女數千，皆裸身跣足，咸烹肉刳心，或坐刂燒舂磨，哀痛之聲，徹聞數裡。吏曰：「此皆在生為官為吏，貪污虐民，不友兄弟，悖負師友，姦淫背夫，為盜為賊，不仁不義者，皆受此報。」生見之大喜，曰：「自今日始出吾不平之氣也。」吏笑攜生之手，偕出。
　　仍入曜靈殿，再拜稽首謝曰：「可謂天地無私，鬼神明察，善惡不能逃其責也。」王曰：「爾既見之，心境坦然矣。煩為吾作一判文，以梟秦檜父子夫妻之惡。」即命吏以紙筆給之。生辭別弗獲，為之判曰：
　　「嘗聞軒轅得六相而助理萬機，則神明應至；虞舜有五臣以揆待百事，而內外平成。苟非懷經天緯地之才，曷敢受調鼎持衡之任？今照：奸臣秦檜，斗筲之器，閭閻小人，雖居宰輔之名，實乃匹夫之輩。獐頭鼠目，何至意以逢迎；羊質虎皮，阿邪情而諂諛。豈有論道經邦之志，全無扶危拯溺之心！久占都堂，懷奸謀而肆為僭分；閉塞賢路，固寵渥而妒忌忠良。殘傷猶剽掠之徒，貪鄙勝穿窬之盜。既忝職居師保，而叨任處公台，惟知黃閣之榮華，罔竭赤心之左右。欺君罔上，擅行予奪之權；嫉賢妒能，專起竄誅之典。姦宄逾其莽、操，兇頑猶勝斯、高。以梟獍為心，蛇蠍成性。忠臣義士盡陷於羅網之中；賊子亂臣，咸置於廟廊之上。視本朝如敞甑，通敵國若宗親。鴟鷹啄架臂之人，犭契犬吠豢牢之主。奸心迷措，受詭胡兀術之私盟；凶行荒殘，害賢將岳飛之正命。悍妻王氏，不言豹隱而言放虎之難；愚子秦火喜，只顧狼貪不顧迴鸞之幸。一家同性而捻惡，萬民共怒以含冤。雖僥倖免乎陽誅，其業報還教陰受。數其罪狀，書千張繭紙不能盡其詳；察此愆非歷萬劫畜生不足償其債。合行榜示，幽顯同知。
　　生呈上，王覽之大喜，贊曰：「讜正之士也！」生因告曰：「奸回受報，僕已目擊，信不誣矣。其他忠臣義士，在於何處？願布一見，以釋鄙懷，
　　不勝感幸。」王人免首而思良久，乃曰：「諸公皆生陽世，為王公大人，享受天祿，數萬餘次矣。壽滿天年，仍回原所。子既求見，吾躬詣導。」　
　　於是登輿而前，俾從者請生於後。行五里許，但見瓊樓玉殿，碧瓦參差，朱牌金字，題曰：「忠賢天爵之府。」既入，有仙童數百，皆衣紫綃之衣，懸丹霞玉　，執彩幢絳節，持羽葆花旌，雲氣繽紛，天花飛舞，龍吟鳳唱，仙樂鏗鏘，異香馥鬱，襲人不散。殿中坐者百餘人，皆冠通天之冠，衣雲錦之裳，躡珠寶之履，玉珂瓊　，光彩射人。絳綃玉女五百餘人，或執五明之扇，或捧八寶之盂，圜侍左右。見王至，悉降階迎迓。賓主禮畢而坐。采女數人，執瑪瑙之壺，捧玻璃之盞，薦龍睛之果，傾鳳寶之茶，世罕聞見。茶既華，王乃道生所見之故，命生致拜。諸公皆答之盡禮，同聲贊曰：「先生可謂仁者能好人、能惡人矣。」乃具席命生坐。生謙遜不敢當賓禮。王曰：「諸公以子斯文，故待之厚，何用苦辭？」生揖謝坐。王謂生曰：「坐上皆忠良之臣、節義之士，在陽則流芳百世，身逝則陰享天恩。每遇明君治世，則生為王侯將相，輔佐朝廷，功施社稷，以輔雍熙之治也。」言既，命二吏送生還。謂生曰「子壽七十有二，今復延一紀。食肉躍馬，五十一年。」生悅，再拜而謝。
　　及辭出，行十餘里，天色漸明。吏指謂生曰：「日出處，即汝家也。」生挽二吏衣，延歸謝之，不覺失手而釋，即展臂而寤，時五鼓矣。
　　清虛先生傳　
　　先生，空谷人也，與麗香公子，飛白散人、玄明高士為友，甚相得，三人者，每感其吹噓之力。惟玄明稍以高自據，先生遣弟子山雲遮道而進，將掩其不備以玷之。
　　雲至，玄明斂容問曰：「子欲日矇昧我邪？」雲曰：「非弟子之浮薄敢與先生抗，實先生使之來耳。先生樂人之從，高士顧精士自顧，不從之，而迷，何相忤邪？」玄明曰：「先生固東西南北人也。某循途守從之士，安能順之？且先生行必萬里，急則怒號，其性恍惚，令人不能捉摶。是以麗香公子觸之而脫冠拜謝，飛白散人遭之而委身如狂。先生且以為鼓舞之術，而不自知其嚴。子亦知之久矣。子以輕清之才，必有覆護之德。幸為我解焉。」雲曰：「高士誠明見萬里者。其如前驅，實無定蹤。倘解高士之圍，必被掃逐。」　
　　言未畢而先生至。雲乃避之，先生復就焉。雲又避之如飛，先生怒而追之，雲乃散去。先生怒益急，山鳴虎嘯，石走沙飛，江湖作浪，天地震動。雲懼，盡其族而復請命。
　　頃之，飛白散人嘯舞而至，與先生相翱翔而問故。先生號呼道之。飛白拍地而笑曰：「玄明乃公之良夜友也，胡相隔哉！」遂挽先生訪麗香。
　　麗香方苦寒，如沉醉狀，顛倒欲眠。先生扶之，而麗香益泄不寧，惟顛首而已。飛白亦擊其額而侵之。麗香力不能勝，乃微告曰：「二公少避，某即醒矣。」飛白乃避地，先生亦息焉。麗香遂振衣而起，含笑相揖。既而，知玄明之外見，乃赤頁然對曰：「吾四人者，天地之秀也。安能缺一哉？某傳世幾葉，支衍雖盛，使無玄明公照顧，則皆影滅矣。況玄明亦與二公有光，何獨避之？」飛白亦笑曰：「玄明雖有缺處，亦頗明白可接。」先生乃和聲然之，令雲去側而請焉。
　　玄明至，交好如初。情思相合，心膽相照，終夜依依，密不忍舍。自是以為常。每至曉，玄明扶雲西歸，惟麗香則與先生倚欄相笑而已。
　　先生盛蓋天下而不征諸色，澤及萬物而不見諸形。然晚年亦性暴好殺。觸之者股栗，犯之者容槁。此其所稟之氣然也。天下之人，想像其豐采，而不能物色之，故稱之曰「清虛先生」云。
　　麗香公子傳　
　　公子，世傳春申君所生，而又曰大樹將軍之別枝，皆未老，然其為人，色豔質美，人咸愛之。與清虛先生交，先生每狎之，公子必佯狂而舞。及飛白散人至，公子必傾心飽其慧而低首不言，若曲腰向謝之意。玄明高士笑而問曰：「子非賤也？遇清虛而即舞；子非貧也？見飛白而多貪。吾甚昏於是。」公子笑而答曰：「以子之明，不能亮察我邪？某奕葉聯芳，身榮朱紫，根據封土，孰能搖兀？但清虛先生善發人，故某一相接，遂胸中道理勃然萌動，是以不覺其舞蹈耳。至于飛白散人，則輕狂無籍人也，得借一枝，便合繾綣，且欲相壓，令人心腹不能自露。況稍得意，瀰漫天地之志，欲使萬物皆出其下。某以一介之資，安能不順受其澤邪？」　
　　明日，玄明以告飛白。飛白怒罵曰：「公子出身草莽，令色諛言。某雖輕狂，力能屈之，使不見天日。」玄明懼，求解於清虛。清虛飄然而來，以和氣勸飛白。飛白意乃釋，且謝曰：「得先生之解，不覺點化矣。」公子遂洗容出見，不動顏色。飛白愧，披指倒地，不敢仰視，且自釋曰：「欲使公子流芳耳，敢有淚滴之累耶？」自是飛白甘為下流，不復與公子比肩矣。
　　玄明知之，亦負慚自蔽者數日。後形跡稍露，乃逾垣一窺公子之影。公子挽清虛，顛首招之。玄明傴僂而來。且掩其半面以謝。公子曰：「某與高士形影相隨，何避嫌之有？」乃席地而坐，終日依依，至曉而散。識者謂公子有容人之度，良有以也。
　　公子少時為婦人女子所愛，有妝殘者，必捐己以親之。清虛先生每戒之曰：「子為色所累，必遭夭折。」公子曰：「今已衰老矣。夫大丈夫寧寸斬焚身，豈死於婦人女子之手耶？」遂謝事，甘朽林下，其族亦漸見零落。
　　後青帝宰世，公子之子孫漸盛，支宗繁衍，不可勝計。然成之者，清虛與力焉。而玄明、飛白，特往往來一親近而已。
　　飛白散人傳　
　　散人乃神仙者流，性喜寒，為人灑落，絕無渣滓。四友中獨與清虛交契，甚不值於麗香，而於玄明，則淡淡相安而已。
　　一日，玄明方出遊，麗香俟於牆陰，猶未相接，而清虛先生搖麗香之肩而問曰：「玄明今夕來否？」曰：「未也。」曰：「子慣為玄明影射。」曰：「玄明家於東海，其來也逾萬山，渡長水，所至之地，一草皆輝。某生於斯，長於斯，進不能前，退不能後，所知者不過撮土之區耳。而玄明之來否，安能逆睹哉？」清虛不悅，乃使人捉散人至。散人遣其僕霰子先報曰：「奈將六出矣。」頃之，前呼後擁，結陣而至。如銜枚疾走，不聞行聲。見者皆凜凜佇目而視。玄明知之，中道而避。清虛以為得計，狂蕩不能自禁。
　　麗香垂首斜欹，若有怒意，噓氣成霧，直浮青霄。玄明知之，乃乘呼挺身而出，與飛白相對。飛白亦仰視玄明，輝光相蕩，似有爭意。玄明讓曰：「吾二人者，不擇富貴。而子入長安，貧者蹙額，何不仁也！且自古田土不擇高下，雖不潔地亦委身親之，何不義也！人皆上進，而子獨甘下賤，雖公庭之前，萬舞自得，何無禮了也！辱泥塗，投井壑，而庭除之前每見侮於童子，何不智也！積厚如山，誇耀於世，方見重於人，人皆稱賞，而略受溫存，去不旋踵，何不信也！某之所以避子者，誠不屑見子耳，豈有所畏哉！」飛白乃回首應曰：「子真蟾蜍耳！胡不自鑒，敢與某比？某之術，倏然而滅，倏然而成，清虛且讓吾之神；剪髮不足以盡巧，飛絮不足以象容，麗香且讓吾之色。子何人也？昭昭者未幾，而昏昏者繼至。安能若某之所至，旁燭無疆，孫康得以夜讀，李　得以擒吳，偉烈照輝，舉世稱瑞，豈不壓倒元白邪？」　
　　清虛因二人凜色交射，各爭容采，乃與麗香從中解紛。散人笑曰：「玄明以滿足自恃耳！」玄明亦笑曰：「飛白以撒潑自放乎！」麗香曰：「二公之才，皆皓皓乎不可尚者，正相映以揚休光可也，而乃爭高下間哉？」二人感而謝焉，遂為莫逆友。自是宇宙重光，皆二人力也。
　　後散人遇詞客於庭中，客曰：「想公久矣。公能爽吾憤耶？」散人不應。客怒，令童子掃其黨而烹之。散人知不免，乃投於鼎鑊，屍解而去。時玄明在上，麗香在前，而清虛往來於左右，皆不能挽而留也。

　　高士生於東海，而其長也。又涉於西海，轍跡遍天下，人皆仰之。未有一登其門者，惟唐玄宗幸其第，遂有廣寒宮之名。
　　高士為人豐采無比，圓神不滯，且識盈虛之數，不以顯晦介意。清虛、麗香、飛白三人皆親炙其輝，而麗香猶一步不忘焉。清虛、飛白忌之，遂加屈辱之苦。麗香望救於高士，高士自晝至暮，始素服而來。
　　麗香方負罪鞠躬叩首以謝，而高士惟冷視而已，不能扶之起也。麗香怒曰：「高士以經天緯地之才，昭明洞察之德，乃不能驅清虛於空谷，掃飛白於炎方，使我草莽之士垂首喪氣於此耶？」高士曰：「居，吾明與子：子非歲寒材也，求免於飄零足矣，而欲拔萃以取榮哉？」麗香益怒，復求解於清虛。清虛不覺大笑，奮然一聲，飛白驚倒。麗香遂排脫而起，自是感清虛而疏高士矣。
　　高士一夕為陰謀所掩，卒然臨之，魂魄俱喪，平生所有，吞並殆盡。九州之人，無貴賤，無大小，皆焚香秉燭以救之。而三人者，則如常而已。然清虛猶淒然有慘意；飛白猶闇然有悲色；而麗香則迎笑而問之，若有幸其磨滅者。既而，高士幸完璧。清虛、飛白從而短之，高士曰：「麗香非有他也，限於力也。某與麗香可以神交，不可以力助；可以形影，不可以形求。何我韜晦之時多，相會能幾何哉！」麗香聞之，歎曰：「一疵不存、萬里明盡者，吾高士也！向壓于飛白而不救者，亦限於力耳！某誠非才，何以知高士之量！」尋續舊交，遨遊良夜，或平原曠野之中，或　岩古壑之嶺，或瓊樓玉宇之上，或紗窗靜檻之下，四友無所不至。所至之處，清氣鬱然，非尋常俗比矣。
　　然高士少時愛學美人眉。麗香謂曰：「以某之色，得君之眉，媚不
　　可言矣。至老年，血魂消瘦，每持一鉤，釣於江漢間。」飛白謂曰：「獨釣寒江，寧舍我為伴耶？」清虛乃笑曰：「吾稍奮焉，則公等或昏昧而逃匿，或棄職而捐軀，尚能相安相得於宇宙間哉？」三人拱而謝曰：「願淡洵以交，萬年一日。幸毋相忄專，以至於是。」清虛曰：「戲之耳！」復叮嚀以為永友，期與天地相終始。
　　風流樂趣
　　風月場中毛女、雲雨帳內將軍，二人但遇就相爭，不顧忘身喪命。
　　一個喜鑽竅尋孔，一個喜啖肉吞□。要知勝敗與輸贏，且聽下回詞詠。
　　詩曰：
　　散悶無拘不作忙，只憑談笑度時光。
　　聊將大豔風流傳，說與知音笑一場。
　　話說烏將軍與毛洞主的故事。這將軍生在臍下，長在腰州，姓烏名龜，表字骨輪，列號風月散人。其性有剛柔兼濟之才，其身有變化多端之術，弄手段能縮能伸，顯威風可小可大。喜時節似鐵加鋼掘上而掘下，悶來時如綿去種倒東而倒西。竊玉偷香，不亞於西廂張珙；取勇當先，勝似那江東楚王。莫道不可將凡比聖，聖凡皆賴此物而生。
　　忽一日，奉□太保命令，兵前往裸人縣，剿捕毛洞中女寇走一遭。唱：一邊點動人和馬，炮響三聲離了老營。抗槍舞棒軍吶喊，叉手趨腳將威風。碗子盔邊生紫霧，龜背殼上蚌青□。這一去，高山峻嶺堂條路，鐵壁　牆撞透明。
　　在路行程多風景，中間少帶骨碑名。將軍掛印俱人馬，正馬軍隨拗馬軍。兵似群鴉來噪△，將如楚漢慣爭鋒。
　　這一去揉碎梅花誠妙手，劈破蓮蓬手歪斷根。鰍如菱窩鑽到底，雙龍入海定成功。短槍刺開格子眼，雙彈打破錦屏風。
　　只用孤紅一拈香肌俏，引得我臨老入花叢。過了九溪十八洞，見了些金菊到芙蓉。劍行十里人馬進，不覺春分晝夜停。對對藍旗報回玉，拍馬已到黑松林。
　　兩乳尖幽屯駟馬，杜家在上紮轅營。中間揭起青衿帳，五爪將軍兩下分。坐下腰州□太保，捉下能爭慣戰人。
　　話說□太保便問：「是何人出馬？」聲音未竟，只見黑松林下閃出一將，生得粗粗大大，又不細細長長。要知此將住何方，腰州府成群結黨。道：「末將不才，出馬一遭，不　兵卒，只須二子。」
　　一騎馬衝出營來，但見洞門外好景：陰崖險峻，玄孔深幽；兩行黑松掩映，一股清水奔流；前尖後長，猶如邊城圍繞；中間水發，恰似湖海汪洋。觀不盡洞門好景，高叫：「紅心小卒，報與你毛洞主得知，叫她強將出馬，弱將休來！」
　　這小校不聽便罷，既然聽說，即到裡面聲言：「禍事！外邊有一獨目將軍，甚是雄將，聲聲叫殺，句句不饒。」
　　毛洞主聽說，帶　水手，身出洞來。且看來將如何排兵，怎生打扮：戴一頂紫巍巍一抹耿不呆的簷盔，披一　細毛織就的烏油龜背鎧，使一根光筋纏就□木炳的點鋼槍，騎一匹追風趕日慣戰豎頭馬。
　　這將軍更看那女怎生模樣，如何裝束：她生得丹△眼，懸膽　；一張沒牙口、兩片粉紅唇；戴一頂前尖後長荷包樣扁食盔，披一　裡紅外白、青邊黑縫兩片頑皮甲，使一條不伸不縮明傷人、暗埋伏紫金□，騎一匹能顛慣跛赤眼清　大口無頭馬。
　　問知：「來將通名，不消問吾。」
　　言：「乃是威鎮腰州烏將軍是也！今奉腰州□太保命令，　兵討伐作亂淫寇。早早下馬受降，免遭千戳萬島之苦。若是牙崩半個不字，憑著俺景東人馬大披掛的將軍，填鑿洞口，殺進子宮，拿住你等，刺血飲馬，取髓補精，那時悔之晚矣 ！」
　　這女子微微冷笑，答曰：「但見你人物標緻，未知你出馬鏖戰如何？此時休要逞羅羅，管叫你一會兒剛強性過，那時節洞門伏首，休教二子來拖。直殺你人困馬乏要求和，那時方才怕我！」
　　這將軍也不答話，兩手拈定光金似鐵硬的獨龍槍，照著那女子分心就刺。這女子也不慌，也不忙，△點頭側身躲過，取出五彩盤桓錦皮套數，及駕相還，兩下皮鼓打動，怎見得好殺。
　　唱：你與你主爭自在，我與我主助風情。你使懶漢推車法，我使駕牯去催更。倒澆蠟燭身流汗，隔山討火洞門紅。正是兩家盤桓處，中間捎帶果子名。
　　兩個栗子答了話，一對枇杷大爭鋒。只愛平坡員眼口，金桔懷內有風菱。怠杏高時蓮子放，膠棗烏梅緊皺紋。小紅染污葡萄被，櫻桃口內咬橙丁。柿　臉兒通紅了，欖橄回味各人心。
　　只戰得月暗秋窗嫌夜短，風吹竹逕恨更鍾。第一合才用機關無勝負；第二合再加手段見輸贏；第三合打起精神嗷戰久；第四合看看筋力不從心。當時惱了毛洞主，怒髮衝冠起歹心：「我今若不顯手段，樂得冤家丟精神。」
　　口裡念動妖邪咒，款款輕輕叫了幾聲。金蓮高峰兩腿裡，悠悠戲溝洞紅心。
　　烏將不識輕生計，盡力具兵重撲門。佳人見來心內喜，放出大水要淹人。五爪將軍忙來展，怎當他急浪滔滔裡外生。煙漫陰崖傍岸柳，撞塌洞口正當鬆。
　　常言道：勢硬難熬軟。話不虛傳果是真。三略六韜雖是曉，二十四解欠分明。怎當他手歪上手歪下來得快，左別右扭不饒人。翻身再擺龍翻裡，拿住將軍胯下存。
　　腰　腿困難咂爭，手軟心忙沒了神。再著一會兒不丟了跑，定死在佳人手相中。
　　幸虧二子多能幹，倒把將軍拉出洞門，虛點一槍逃了命，到底難熬久戰人。
　　前走的厭頭塌腦腰間將，後趕的跛口張牙再興兵。一身英雄隨流水，五陵豪氣逐東風。好似猛風吹敗葉，猶如急雨打殘紅。雨散雲收鴛帳冷，香消風盡繡樓空。
　　編成毛女烏龜傳，說與風流子弟聽。

     "=La Guardia Blanca.=--Es el título de una novela escrita en inglés
     por Conan Doyle y publicada en español por la casa de Appleton de
     Nueva York, que acabamos de leer con toda complacencia, una vez que
     reune á su ingenio y fácil lenguaje, un tema muy bien urdido y
     descripciones sumamente interesantes. En la Guardia Blanca
     encontramos episodios históricos de la Edad Media trazados con una
     naturalidad pasmosa, de tal modo bien pintados los cuadros, de tal
     manera descritas las costumbres, que le parece á uno encontrarse en
     aquella edad y trabar conocimiento con los personajes. Comienza la
     acción en un convento de monjes, presentado con todos sus
     adminículos de mano maestra y luego se desarrolla la trama con
     creciente interés, descollando en medio de aquel ruido de armas y
     de combates que se repiten á cada momento sin motivo como era la
     usanza entonces, los personajes principales como el barón Morel,
     Dugueslin, el Príncipe Negro y todos los otros que figuran en
     primera línea, que tan vivamente impresiona, el ánimo del lector,
     de la misma manera que el héroe de la novela del joven Roger
     Clinton tan varonil y tan honrado á pesar de haber recibido su
     educación en un convento. En suma la obra de Conan Doyle es una
     preciosa joya de gran valor entre las obras literarias de su mismo
     género. De la misma manera que la Guardia Blanca nos cautivó la
     lectura de otra lindísima novela escrita por Roberto Stevenson con
     el título de Plagiado la cual igualmente es una narración deliciosa
     hecha por un joven que al salir por la vez primera de su pueblo y
     de su hogar, tuvo las más raras y las más inesperadas aventuras.
     Esa obra también fué publicada por la casa de Appleton que siempre
     demuestra el mejor gusto en sus ediciones españolas."--_La Patria_,

PRÓLOGO DE LA EDICIÓN ESPAÑOLA
En el campo abundantísimo de la moderna literatura inglesa, la casa de
Appleton no ha tenido sino el embarazo de la elección, para decidir qué
obra debería ocupar el segundo lugar en la colección de novelas
inaugurada con el aplaudido "Misterio..." de Hugo Conway.
Roberto Luis Stevenson ha sido el autor elegido, y si la traducción no
ha sido tal que borre todos los méritos del original, ya encontrarán no
poco que aplaudir y más aún con que solazarse los lectores
hispanoamericanos.
_La Isla del Tesoro_ no tiene la pretensión de ser una novela
trascendental encaminada á mejorar las costumbres ó censurar los hábitos
de un pueblo. No entran en ella en juego todas esas pasiones candentes
cuyo hervidero llena las modernas obras de ficción con miasmas que hacen
daño. El lector que busca en libros de este género un mero solaz que
refresque su espíritu, después de largas horas de un pesado trabajo
moral ó material, no se verá aquí detenido por disertaciones inoportunas
ni problemas ociosos. Nada de eso.
_La Isla del Tesoro_ es una narración llana, un romance fácil, un cuento
sabroso con un niño por héroe, y que, á pesar de sus peripecias
dramáticas y conmovedoras, conserva en todo el discurso del libro una
pureza y una sencillez tales que no habrá hogar, por mucha severidad
que impere en él, del cual pueda desterrársele con razón.
Stevenson se propuso, además, describir con esa difícil facilidad que
parece ser un secreto suyo, esas escenas y aventuras marinas en que el
lector percibe, desprendiéndose de la sencilla narración, ya el olor
acre de las brisas de la playa, ya el rumor de la pleamar deshaciéndose
contra las rocas, ya el eco monótono de los cantos de marineros y
grumetes empeñados en la maniobra.
La fábula es sencilla pero perfectamente verosímil; con sólo que se
recuerden los horrores que realizaron en los mares que dividen el
Antiguo del Nuevo Continente aquellas hordas de piratas ingleses que
tantas veces abordaron las naos de Nueva España y del Perú, se comprende
la posibilidad de ese feroz Capitán Flint que, tras de adquirir un
tesoro por la rapiña y la audacia, lo esconde en el corazón de una isla
desierta para excitar con él, á su muerte, la avaricia y la sed de oro
de sus mismos cómplices.
_La Isla del Tesoro_ ha sido juzgada de la manera más favorable por los
más severos críticos ingleses, y es de esperarse que, salvo lo que pueda
haberla depreciado la traducción, encuentre una acogida que corresponda
al mérito del original, no menos que al empeño con que la casa de los
Sres. Appleton han llevado á cabo la edición española.

LA ISLA DEL TESORO
PARTE I
_EL VIEJO FILIBUSTERO_
CAPÍTULO I
EL VIEJO LOBO MARINO EN LA POSADA DEL "ALMIRANTE BENBOW"
Imposible me ha sido rehusarme á las repetidas instancias que el
Caballero Trelawney, el Doctor Livesey y otros muchos señores me han
hecho para que escribiese la historia circunstanciada y completa de la
Isla del Tesoro. Voy, pues, á poner manos á la obra contándolo todo,
desde el _alfa_ hasta el _omega_, sin dejarme cosa alguna en el tintero,
exceptuando la determinación geográfica de la isla, y esto tan solamente
porque tengo por seguro que en ella existe todavía un tesoro no
descubierto. Tomo la pluma en el año de gracia de 17--y retrocedo hasta
la época en que mi padre tenía aún la posada del "_Almirante Benbow_," y
hasta el día en que por primera vez llegó á alojarse en ella aquel viejo
marino de tez bronceada y curtida por los elementos, con su grande y
visible cicatriz.
Todavía lo recuerdo como si aquello hubiera sucedido ayer: llegó á las
puertas de la posada estudiando su aspecto, afanosa y atentamente,
seguido por su maleta que alguien conducía tras él en una carretilla de
mano. Era un hombre alto, fuerte, pesado, con un moreno pronunciado,
color de avellana. Su trenza ó coleta alquitranada le caía sobre los
hombros de su nada limpia blusa marina. Sus manos callosas, destrozadas
y llenas de cicatrices enseñaban las extremidades de unas uñas rotas y
negruzcas. Y su rostro moreno llevaba en una mejilla aquella gran
cicatriz de sable, sucia y de un color blanquizco, lívido y repugnante.
Todavía lo recuerdo, paseando su mirada investigadora en torno del
cobertizo, silbando mientras examinaba y prorrumpiendo, en seguida, en
aquella antigua canción marina que tan á menudo le oí cantar después:
    "_Son quince los que quieren el cofre de aquel muerto
       Son quince ¡yo--ho--hó! son quince ¡viva el rom!_"
con una voz de viejo, temblorosa, alta, que parecía haberse formado y
roto en las barras del cabrestante. Cuando pareció satisfecho de su
examen llamó á la puerta con un pequeño bastón, especie de espeque que
llevaba en la mano, y cuando acudió mi padre, le pidió bruscamente un
vaso de rom. Después que se le hubo servido lo saboreó lenta y
pausadamente, como un antiguo catador, paladeándolo con delicia y sin
cesar de recorrer alternativamente con la mirada, ora las rocas, ora la
enseña de la posada.
--Esta es una caleta de buen fondo--dijo en su jerga marina--y al mismo
tiempo una taberna muy bien situada. ¿Mucha clientela, patrón?
--Nó, le respondió mi padre, bastante poca, lo cual es tanto más
sensible.
--Bueno, dijo él, entonces este es el camarote que yo necesito. Hola,
tú, grumete, le gritó al hombre que rodaba la carretilla en que venía su
gran cofre de á bordo, trae acá esa maleta y súbela. Pienso fondear aquí
un poco. Y luego prosiguió:--Yo soy un hombre bastante llano; todo lo
que yo necesito es rom, huevos y tocino y aquella altura que se vé allí
para estar á la mira de las embarcaciones. ¿Quieren Vds. saber cómo han
de llamarme? llámenme Capitán. ¡Oh! ¡ya sé lo que van á pedirme! Al
decir esto arrojó tres ó cuatro monedas de oro en el umbral y añadió con
un tono de altivez y una mirada tan orgullosa como de un verdadero
Capitán:--¡Avisarme cuando se acabe eso!
Y la verdad es que, aunque su pobre traje no predisponía en su favor, ni
menos aún su lenguaje tosco, no tenía absolutamente el aspecto de un
tramposo, sino que parecía más bien un marino, un maestro de embarcación
acostumbrado á que se le obedezca como á Capitán. El muchacho que traía
la carretilla nos refirió que la posta ó coche del correo lo había
dejado la víspera por la mañana en la posada del "_Royal George_," que
allí se informó qué albergues había á lo largo de la costa, y que
habiendo oído buenos informes probablemente acerca del nuestro, y
habiéndosele descrito como muy poco concurrido, lo había elegido de
preferencia á todos los demás para su residencia. Eso fué todo lo que
pudimos averiguar acerca de nuestro huésped.
El Capitán era habitualmente un hombre de muy pocas palabras. Todo el
día se lo pasaba, ya vagando á orillas de la caleta, ó ya encima de las
rocas, con un largo telescopio ó anteojo marino. Por las noches se
acomodaba en un rincón de la sala, cerca del fuego y se consagraba á
beber rom y agua con todas sus fuerzas. Las más veces no quería
contestar cuando se le hablaba: contentábase con arrojar sobre el que le
dirijía la palabra una rápida y altiva mirada, y con dejar escapar de su
nariz un resoplido que formaba en la atmósfera, cerca de su cara, una
curva de vapor espeso. Los de la casa y nuestros amigos y clientes
ordinarios pronto concluimos por no hacerle caso. Día por día, cuando
llegaba á la posada, de vuelta de sus vagabundas excursiones, preguntaba
invariablemente si no se había visto algunos marineros atravesar por el
camino. Al principio nos pareció que la falta de camaradas que le
hiciesen compañía era lo que le obligaba á hacer esa constante pregunta;
pero muy luego vimos que lo que él procuraba más bien era evitarlos.
Cuando algún marinero se detenía en la posada, como lo hacían entonces y
lo hacen aún los que siguen el camino de la costa para Brístol, el
Capitán lo examinaba al través de las cortinas de la puerta, antes de
entrar á la sala, y ya se sabía que, cuando tal concurrente se
presentaba, él permanecía invariablemente mudo como una carpa.
Para mí, sin embargo, no había mucho de misterio ni de secreto en sus
alarmas, en las cuales tenía yo cierta participación. Un día me había
llamado aparte y sigilosamente me había prometido darme una pieza de
cuatro peniques el día primero de cada mes con la sola condición de que
estuviese alerta, y le avisara, en el momento mismo en que descubriera,
la aparición de un "marino con una sola pierna." Con frecuencia, sin
embargo, cuando el día primero del mes iba yo á reclamar mi salario
prometido, no me daba más respuesta que su habitual y formidable
resoplido de la nariz y clavar sus ojos airados en los míos, obligándome
á bajarlos; pero antes de que se hubiera pasado una semana, ya estaba yo
seguro de que su parecer habría cambiado y lo veía, en efecto, venir á
mí trayéndome espontáneamente mi moneda de cuatro peniques, no sin
reiterarme sus órdenes de estar alerta para avisarle la aparición de
aquel "marino con una sola pierna."
Imposible me sería contar hasta qué punto ese esperado personaje turbaba
y entristecía mis sueños. En las noches tempestuosas, cuando el viento
hacía estremecer los cuatro ángulos de nuestra casa y cuando la marea
bramaba despedazando sus olas á lo largo de la caleta y sobre los
abruptos riscos, yo le veía aparecérseme en sueños en mil formas
diversas y con mil expresiones diabólicas. Ya era la pierna cortada
hasta la rodilla, ya desarticulada desde la cadera; ya se me aparecía
como una especie de criatura monstruosa que jamás había tenido sino una
sola pierna, y ésa de forma indescriptible. Otras ocasiones lo veía
saltar y correr y perseguirme por zanjas y vallados, lo cual constituía,
por cierto, la peor de todas mis pesadillas. Hay que convenir, pues, en
que pagaba yo bien cara mi pobre soldada mensual de cuatro peniques, con
aquellas visiones abominables.
Pero si bien es cierto que tal era mi terror á propósito del marino de
una pierna, también es verdad que, por lo que respecta al Capitán mismo,
le tenía yo mucho menos miedo que cualquiera de los que lo conocían.
Había algunas noches en que se permitía tomar mucho más rom del que
podía razonablemente tolerar su cabeza. Entonces se le veía sentarse y
entonar sus perversas y salvajes viejas cántigas marinas de que ya nadie
hacía caso. Pero á veces le ocurría pedir vasos para todos y forzaba á
su tímido y trémulo auditorio á escuchar sus patibularias historias ó á
formar un coro á sus siniestras canciones. Con frecuencia oía yo á la
casa entera estremecerse con aquel estribillo:
    "_El diablo ¡yo--ho--hó! el diablo ¡viva el rom!_"
en el que todos los vecinos se le unían por amor á sus vidas, con el
temor de que aquel ogro les diese la muerte, y cada cual procurando
levantar la voz más que el compañero de al lado, á fin de no llamar la
atención por su negligencia, porque en aquellos accesos el Capitán era
el compañero más intolerante y arrebatado que se ha conocido. Á veces
golpeaba bruscamente con su callosa mano sobre la mesa para imponer
silencio absoluto á los circunstantes; otras, se dejaba arrebatar á un
ímpetu de cólera salvaje á la menor pregunta y en otras le producía el
mismo efecto el que ninguna se le dirijiese, porque decía que la
concurrencia no estaba atendiendo á su narración. Por ningún motivo
hubiera él consentido en que alma nacida abandonase la posada hasta que,
sintiéndose ya completamente ebrio y soñoliento él mismo, se iba
tambaleando á tirarse sobre su cama.
Sus cuentos y narraciones era lo que á las gentes espantaba más que
todo. Horribles historias eran, por cierto; historias de ahorcados,
castigos bárbaros como el llamado "_paseo de la tabla_" y temerosas
tempestades en el mar y en el Paso de Tortugas--y salvajes hazañas y
abruptos parajes en el Mar Caribe y costa firme. Según sus narraciones
debió pasar su vida entera entre los hombres más perversos que Dios ha
permitido que crucen sobre los mares; y el lenguaje que usaba para
contar todas sus historias disgustaba á aquel sencillo auditorio de
campesinos, casi tanto como los crímenes espantosos que describía con
él. Mi padre siempre estaba diciendo que la posada concluiría por
arruinarse, porque las gentes pronto dejarían de concurrir á ella para
que se las tiranizase allí, y se las asustara y se las mandara á acostar
horripiladas y estremeciéndose; pero yo creo que, al contrario su
presencia no dejó de sernos de algún provecho. Las gentes comenzaron por
tenerle un miedo atroz pero á poco, según hoy puedo recordarlo, ya
empezaban á gustar de él. Porque, á la verdad, el Capitán era una fuente
de valiosas emociones, enmedio de aquella quieta y sosegada vida del
campo. Algunos de los más jóvenes de nuestros vecinos no le escatimaban
ya ni su misma admiración, llamándole un verdadero lobo marino, un
tiburón legítimo y otros nombres parecidos, agregando que hombres de su
ralea son precisamente los que hacen que el nombre de Inglaterra sea
temido y respetado sobre el océano.
Pero también, en cierto modo no dejaba de llevarnos bonitamente hacia la
ruina; porque su permanencia se prolongaba en nuestra casa semana tras
semana, y después un mes tras de otro, de tal manera que ya las monedas
de oro aquellas habían sido más que devengadas, sin que mi padre se
hiciese el ánimo de insistir demasiado en que renovase la exhibición. Si
alguna vez se permitía indicar algo, el Capitán resoplaba por el fuelle
de su nariz de una manera tan formidable que casi se pudiera decir que
bramaba y con su feroz mirada arrojaba á mi pobre padre fuera de la
habitación. Yo lo ví, con frecuencia, después de tales repulsas,
retorcerse los manos desesperadamente y tengo la certeza de que, el
fastidio y el terror que se dividían su existencia contribuyeron
grandemente á acelerar su anticipada é infeliz muerte.
En todo el tiempo que vivió con nosotros el Capitán no hizo el menor
cambio en su traje, sino fué el comprarse algunos pares de medias,
aprovechando el paso casual de un buhonero. Habiéndosele caído una de
las alas de su sombrero, no se ocupó de reducir á su lugar primitivo
aquel colgajo que era para él una gran molestia, sobre todo, cuando
hacía viento. Me acuerdo todavía de la miserable apariencia de su jubón
que remendaba, él en persona, arriba en su habitación y que, antes de su
muerte, no era ya otra cosa más que remiendos. Jamás escribió ni recibía
carta alguna, ni se dignaba hablar á nadie que no fuese de los vecinos
que él conocía por tales, y aun á éstos hacíalo solamente cuando bullían
en su cabeza los espíritus del rom. En cuanto al gran cofre de á bordo,
ninguno de nosotros había logrado verlo abierto.
Solamente una vez sufrió un verdadero enojo, lo cual sucedió poco antes
de su triste fin, en ocasión en que la salud de mi padre estaba ya
declinando en una pendiente, que acabó por llevarlo hasta el sepulcro.
El Doctor Livesey vino una vez con cierto retardo, por la tarde, con el
objeto de ver á su enfermo; tomó alguna ligera comida que le ofreció mi
madre y se entró, en seguida, á la sala, para fumar su puro, en tanto
que le traían su caballo desde el pueblo, porque en la posada carecíamos
de bestias y de caballerizas. Yo me fuí tras él y me acuerdo haber
observado el contraste que ofreció á mis ojos aquel doctor fino y
aseado, de cabellera empolvada, tan blanca como la nieve, de vivísimos
ojos negros y maneras gratas y amables, con aquellos retozones palurdos
del campo; y más que todo con el sucio, enorme y repugnante espantajo de
pirata de nuestra posada, que se veía sentado en su rincón habitual,
bastante avanzado ya á aquella hora en su embriaguez cuotidiana, y
recargando sus brazos musculosos sobre la mesa. De repente nuestro
huésped comenzó á canturriar su eterna canción:
    "_Son quince los que quieren el cofre de aquel muerto_
       _Son quince ¡yo--ho--hó! son quince ¡viva el rom!_
     _El diablo y la bebida hicieron todo el resto,_
       _El diablo ¡yo--ho--hó! el diablo ¡viva el rom!_"
Al principio me había yo figurado que el cofre del muerto que él cantaba
sería probablemente aquel gran baúl suyo que guardaba arriba en su
cuarto del frente de la casa, y este pensamiento no había dejado de
mezclarse confusamente en mis pesadillas con la figura del esperado
marino de una sola pierna. Pero cuando sucedió lo que ahora refiero, ya
todos habíamos dejado de conceder la más pequeña atención al extraño
canto de nuestro hombre que, con excepción del Doctor Livesey, no era ya
nuevo para nadie. Pude observar, sin embargo, que al Doctor no le
producía un efecto de los más agradables, porque le ví levantar los ojos
por un momento, con un aire de bastante disgusto, hacia el Capitán,
antes de comenzar una conversación que emprendió enseguida con el viejo
Taylor, el jardinero, acerca de una nueva curación para las afecciones
reumáticas. Entre tanto el Capitán parecía alegrarse al sonido de su
propia música, de una manera gradual, hasta que concluyó por golpear con
su mano sobre la mesa de aquella manera brusca y autoritativa que todos
nosotros sabíamos muy bien que quería decir: "¡Silencio!" Todas las
voces callaron á la vez, como por encanto, excepto la del Doctor Livesey
que continuó dejándose oir imperturbablemente clara y agradable,
interrumpida solamente, por las vigorosas fumadas que daba á su puro
cada dos ó tres palabras. El Capitán lo miró fijamente por algunos
momentos, volvió á golpear sobre la mesa, le lanzó una nueva mirada más
terrible todavía y concluyó por vociferar, con un villano y soez
juramento:
--¡Silencio, allí, los del entre-puente!
--¿Es á mí á quien Vd. se dirijía? preguntó el Doctor, á lo cual nuestro
rufián contestó que sí, no sin añadir otro juramento nuevo.
--No le replicaré á Vd. más que una cosa, dijo el Doctor, y es que si
Vd. continúa bebiendo rom como hasta aquí, muy pronto el mundo se verá
libre de una bien asquerosa sabandija.
Sería inútil pretender describir la furia que se apoderó del viejo al
escuchar esto. Púsose en pie de un salto, sacó y abrió una navaja marina
de gran tamaño y balanceándola abierta sobre la palma de la mano
amenazaba clavar al Doctor contra la pared.
El Doctor no hizo el más pequeño movimiento. Tornó á hablarle de nuevo,
lo mismo que antes, por encima de su hombro y con el mismo tono de voz,
solo un poco más alto de manera que oyesen bien todos los circunstantes,
pero con la más perfecta calma y serenidad:
--Si no vuelve Vd. esa navaja al bolsillo en este mismo instante, le
juro á Vd. por quien soy que será ahorcado en la próxima reunión del
Tribunal del Condado.
Siguióse luego un combate de miradas entre uno y otro, pero pronto el
Capitán hubo de rendirse, guardó su arma y volvió á su asiento gruñendo
como un perro que ha sido mordido.
--Y ahora, amigo--continuó el Doctor--desde el momento en que me consta
la presencia de un hombre como Vd. en mi distrito, puede Vd. estar
seguro de que ni de día ni de noche se le perderá de vista. Yo no soy
solamente un médico, soy también un magistrado; así es que, si llega
hasta mí la queja más insignificante en su contra, aunque no sea más que
por un rasgo de grosería como el de esta noche, ya sabré tomar las
medidas más del caso para que se le dé á Vd. caza y se le arroje del
país. Haga Vd. que baste con esto.
Poco después llegó á la puerta la cabalgadura, y el Doctor Livesey
partió en ella sin dilación. Pero el Capitán se mantuvo pacífico aquella
noche y aun otras muchas de las subsecuentes.

CAPÍTULO II
"BLACK DOG" APARECE Y DESAPARECE
No mucho tiempo después de lo referido en el capítulo precedente,
ocurrió el primero de los sucesos misteriosos que nos desembarazaron,
por fin, del Capitán, aunque no de sus negocios como pronto lo verán los
que leyeren. Corría, á la sazón, un invierno crudo y frío, con largas y
terribles heladas y deshechos temporales. Mi pobre padre continuaba
empeorando de día en día, al grado de que ya se veía muy claramente la
poca probabilidad de que llegase á ver una nueva primavera. El manejo de
la posada había caído enteramente en manos de mi madre y mías, y ambos
teníamos demasiado que hacer con ella para que nos fuese dable el parar
mientes con exceso en nuestro desagradable huésped.
Era una fría y desapacible mañana del mes de Enero--muy temprano
todavía--la caleta, cubierta toda de escarcha, aparecía gris ó
blanquecina, en tanto que la maréa subía, lamiendo suavemente las
piedras de la playa, y el sol, muy bajo aún, tocaba apenas las cimas de
las lomas y brillaba allá muy lejos en el confín del océano. El Capitán
se había levantado mucho más temprano que de costumbre y se había
dirijido hacia la playa, con su especie de alfange, colgando bajo los
anchos faldones de su vieja blusa marina, su anteojo de larga vista
bajo el brazo y su sombrero echado hacia atrás sobre la cabeza. Todavía
me parece ver su respiración, suspensa en forma de una estela de humo,
en el camino que iba recorriendo á largos pasos, y aún recuerdo que el
último sonido que oí de él cuando se hubo perdido tras de la gran roca,
fué un gran resoplido de indignación, como si todavía revolviese en su
ánimo el recuerdo desagradable de la escena con el Doctor Livesey.
Ahora bien, mi madre estaba á la sazón, con mi padre, en su habitación y
yo me ocupaba en arreglar la mesa para el almuerzo, mientras volvía el
Capitán, cuando repentinamente se abrió la puerta de la sala y penetró á
ésta un hombre que yo no había visto hasta entonces. Era éste un
individuo pálido y encanijado, en cuya mano izquierda faltaban dos dedos
y que, aunque llevaba también su cuchilla al cinto, no tenía, ni con
mucho, el aspecto de un hombre de armas tomar. Yo siempre estaba en
acecho de marineros de una sola pierna, ó de dos, pero el que acababa de
aparecérseme era para mí un enigma. No tenía el aspecto de un verdadero
marino y sin embargo había en él no sé qué aire de gente del mar.
Le pregunté, desde luego, en qué podía servirle y él me contestó que
deseaba tomar un poco de rom, pero apenas iba yo á salir de la sala en
busca de lo que pedía cuando se sentó á una de las mesas excitándome á
que me acercase á él. Yo me detuve en el sitio en que su indicación me
había cogido, teniendo en mi mano una servilleta.
--Ven aquí, muchacho, me repitió, acércate más.
Yo dí un paso hacia él.
--¿Es para mi camarada Bill para quien has preparado esta mesa? me
preguntó dirijiéndome cierta mirada extraña.
--Ignoro quien es su camarada Bill, le contesté yo; esta mesa es para
una persona que se aloja en nuestra casa y á quien nosotros llamamos el
Capitán.
--Eso es--replicó él--mi camarada Bill lo mismo puede ser llamado
Capitán, que nó. Tiene una cicatriz en una mejilla y unos modos
valientemente agradables, muy propios suyos, sobre todo, cuando está
bebido. Como señas, pues... ¿qué más?... te repito que tu Capitán tiene
una cicatriz en un carrillo... y si más quieres, te diré que ese
carrillo es el derecho... ¡Ah! ¡bueno! Ya lo había yo dicho... ¿con que
mi camarada Bill está aquí, en esta casa?
--Ahora anda fuera, le contesté yo; ha salido á paseo.
--¿Por dónde se ha ido, muchacho?
Señalé yo entonces en dirección de la roca, diciéndole que el Capitán no
tardaría en volver; respondí á algunas otras de sus preguntas y entonces
él añadió:
--¡Ah! ¡vamos! esto será tan bueno como un vaso de rom para mi camarada
Bill.
La expresión de su cara, al decir esto, no tenía nada de agradable, y yo
tenía mis razones para pensar que aquel extraño se equivocaba, en el
supuesto de que creyese lo que decía. Pero, al fin y al cabo, pensé que
aquello no era negocio mío, además de que no era asunto muy fácil el
saber qué partido tomar. El recién venido se mantenía esquivándose tras
la parte interior de la puerta de la posada, ojeando de soslayo en torno
de su escondrijo, como gato que está en acecho de un ratón. Una vez,
salíme yo afuera hacia el camino, pero él me llamó adentro
inmediatamente y como no obedeciese su mandato tan pronto como él
quería, un cambio instantáneo y espantoso se operó en su semblante
enjuto, y me repitió su orden acompañándola de un juramento que me hizo
brincar. Tan luego como estuve de nuevo adentro resumió él su primitiva
actitud, mitad halagüeña, mitad burlona, dióme una palmadilla sobre el
hombro y me dijo:
--Vamos, chico, tú eres un buen muchacho, yo no he querido más que
asustarte de broma. Yo tengo un hijo de tu edad, añadió, que se te
parece como un motón á otro, y te aseguro que ya es él el orgullo de mi
arte. Pero la gran cosa para los muchachos es la disciplina, chico...
mucha disciplina. Mira, si alguna vez hubieras tú navegado con Bill, á
buen seguro que te hubieras quedado allí esperando que te hablaran
segunda vez; yo te digo que no. Nunca Bill ha obrado de otro modo, ni
ninguno de los que han navegado con él. Ahora bien, no me engaño, allí
viene el camarada Bill con su anteojo bajo el brazo, bendito sea su
viejo arte que me permite reconocerlo. Sea en hora buena: tú y yo,
muchacho, vámonos allá detrás, á la sala, y nos esconderemos tras de la
puerta para dar á Bill una pequeña sorpresa; y bendito sea de nuevo su
arte una y mil veces!
Al decir esto mi hombre retrocedió conmigo á la sala y me colocó detrás
de él, en el rincón, de tal manera que á ambos nos ocultaba la puerta
abierta. Yo estaba positivamente inquieto y alarmado, como es fácil
figurárselo, y añadía no poco á mis temores el observar que aquel nuevo
personaje tampoco las tenía todas consigo. Yo le veía alistar el puño de
su cuchilla y aflojar la hoja en la vaina, sin que, durante todo el
tiempo que estuvimos en espera, hubiera cesado de _tragar gordo_, ó como
si hubiera tenido, según la expresión familiar, un nudo en la garganta.
Por último entró el Capitán, empujó la puerta tras de sí, sin ver á
izquierda ni á derecha, y marchó directamente, á través del cuarto,
hacia donde le esperaba su almuerzo.
Entonces mi hombre pronunció, con una voz que me pareció se esforzaba en
hacer hueca y campanuda, esta sola palabra:
--¡Bill!
El Capitán giró rápidamente sobre sus talones y se encaró á nosotros.
Todo lo que había de moreno en su rostro había desaparecido en aquel
momento y hasta su misma nariz ofrecía un tinte de una lividez azulada.
Tenía toda la apariencia de un hombre que vé un espectro, ó al diablo
mismo, ó algo peor, si es que lo hay y, créaseme bajo mi palabra, sentí
compasión por él, al verle, en un solo instante, ponerse tan viejo y tan
enfermo.
--Ven acá, Bill, tú me conoces bien. Tú no has olvidado á un viejo
camarada, Bill, estoy seguro de ello; continuó diciendo el
recién-venido.
El Capitán exclamó entonces en una especie de boqueada penosa:
--¡Black Dog![1]
--¿Pues quién había de ser sino él? replicó el otro, comenzando á
sentirse un poco más tranquilo. Black Dog, sí, que, lo mismo que antes
viene aquí, á la Posada del "_Almirante Benbow_" para saludar á su
viejo camarada Billy. ¡Ah, Bill, Bill, cuántas cosas hemos visto juntos,
nosotros dos, desde la época en que perdí estos dos "garfios"! añadió,
levantando un poco su mano mutilada.
--Bien, dijo el Capitán, ya veo que me has cogido... aquí me tienes...
vamos... ¿qué quieres?... habla... dí... ¿de qué se trata?
--Veo bien que eres el mismo, replicó Black Dog; tienes razón Bill,
tienes razón. Voy á tomar un vaso de rom que me traerá este buen
chiquillo á quien tanto me he aficionado desde luego; en seguida nos
sentaremos, si tú quieres y hablaremos lisa y llanamente como buenos
camaradas que somos.
Cuando yo volví con el rom ya los dos se habían sentado en cada una de
las cabeceras de la mesa en que el Capitán iba á almorzar. Black Dog
habíase quedado más cerca de la puerta y se le veía sentado de lado, de
modo que pudiese tener un ojo atento á su camarada antiguo, y otro,
según me pareció, á su retirada libre.
Despidióme luego ordenándome que dejase la puerta abierta de par en par,
y añadió:
--Nada de espiar por las cerraduras, muchacho, ¿entiendes?
Yo no tuve más que hacer sino dejarlos solos y retirarme á la cantina
del establecimiento.
Durante muy largo tiempo, por más que puse mis cinco sentidos en tratar
de oir algo de lo que pasaba, nada llegó á mis oídos sino fué un rumor
vago y confuso de conversación; pero al cabo las voces comenzaron á
hacerse más y más perceptibles; y ya me fué posible el escuchar
distintamente alguna que otra palabra, la mayor parte de ellas,
juramentos é insolencias proferidos por el Capitán.
--¡Nó, nó, nó nó! le oí proferir, nó! y concluyamos de una vez!" Y
después añadió: si hay que ahorcar, ahorcarlos á todos: y basta!
Luego, de una manera repentina, todo se volvió una tremenda explosión de
juramentos y otros ruidos temerosos. La silla y la mesa rodaron en masa,
siguióse un chischás de aceros que se chocaban y luego un grito de
dolor: en ese mismo instante pude ver á Black Dog en plena fuga y al
Capitán persiguiéndole encarnizadamente: ambos con sus cuchillas
desenvainadas y el primero de ellos, manando sangre abundantemente de su
hombro izquierdo. Precisamente al llegar á la puerta, el Capitán
descargó sobre el fugitivo una última y tremenda cuchillada con la cual
sin duda alguna lo habría abierto hasta la espina, si no hubiera
tropezado su arma con la enseña de nuestra posada que fué la que recibió
el golpe, cuya señal es fácil ver, todavía hoy, en el marco de nuestro
"_Almirante Benbow_" hacia la parte de abajo.
Aquel mandoble fué el último de la riña. Una vez afuera ya, y sobre el
camino público, Black Dog, á despecho de su herida, pareció decir, con
una prisa maravillosa, "pies, para qué os quiero" y en medio minuto le
vimos desaparecer tras de la cima de la loma cercana. El Capitán, por su
parte, permaneció clavado cerca de la enseña del establecimiento como un
hombre extraviado. Poco después pasó su mano varias veces sobre sus
ojos, como para cerciorarse de que no soñaba, y en seguida volvió á
penetrar en la casa.
--Jim, me dijo, ¡trae rom! y al hablarme se bamboleaba un poco y con
una mano se apoyaba contra la pared.
--¿Está Vd. herido? le pregunté.
--¡Rom! me repitió,--necesito irme de aquí... rom! rom!
Corrí á buscárselo; pero con la excitación que los sucesos ocurridos me
habían ocasionado, rompí un vaso, obstruí la llave, y cuando todavía
estaba yo procurando despacharme lo mejor posible, escuché el golpe
ruidoso y pesado de una persona que se desplomaba en la sala. Acudí
corriendo y me encontré con el cuerpo del Capitán tendido de largo á
largo sobre el suelo. En el mismo instante, mi madre, á quien habían
alarmado las voces y rumores de la pelea, descendía corriendo la
escalera para venir en mi ayuda. Entre ambos levantamos la cabeza al
Capitán, que respiraba fuerte y penosamente, pero cuyos ojos estaban
cerrados y en cuya cara aparecía un color horrible.
--¡Cielos, cielos santos! grito mi madre, ¡qué desgracia sobre nuestra
casa, y con tu pobre padre enfermo!
Entre tanto á mí no se me ocurría la más insignificante idea sobre lo
que pudiera hacerse para socorrer al Capitán, pareciéndome seguro que
había sido herido de muerte en su encarnizado combate con aquel extraño.
Traje el rom para asegurarme de ello y traté de hacerlo pasar á su
garganta; pero tenía los dientes terriblemente apretados los unos contra
los otros y sus quijadas estaban tan duras como si hubieran sido de
acero. Fué para nosotros, entonces, un grandísimo alivio el ver abrirse
la puerta y aparecer en ella al Doctor Livesey que venía á hacer á mi
padre su visita cuotidiana.
--¡Oh, Doctor! exclamamos mi madre y yo á la vez. ¿qué haremos? ¿en
dónde estará herido?
--¿Herido? dijo el Doctor; ¡qué va á estarlo! ni más ni menos que
ustedes ó yo. Este hombre acaba de tener un ataque como yo se lo había
pronosticado. Ahora bien, Mrs. Hawkins, corra Vd. arriba y, si es
posible, no diga Vd. á nuestro enfermo ni una palabra de lo que pasa.
Por mi parte, mi deber es tratar de hacer cuanto pueda por salvar la
vida tres veces inútil de este hombre. Anda pues, tú, Jim, y trae luego
una palangana.
Cuando volví, trayendo lo que se me pidió, el Doctor había ya
descubierto el nervudo brazo del Capitán, desembarazándolo de sus
mangas. Todo él aparecía pintado con esas figuras indelebles que se
dibujan en el cuerpo los marineros y los presidiarios. "_Buena suerte_"
decía una de sus inscripciones; y en otras, "_Vientos prósperos_,"
"_Caprichos de Billy Bones_" se podía leer en caracteres claros y
cuidadosamente ejecutados sobre el antebrazo. Un poco más arriba, cerca
del hombro, se veía un esbozo de patíbulo y pendiente de él un hombre
ahorcado, todo ello, según á mí me pareció, ejecutado con bastante
destreza y propiedad.
--¡Profético! dijo el Doctor, tocando este último dibujo con su dedo. Y
ahora, Maese Billy Bones, si tal es su nombre, vamos á ver de qué color
es su sangre. Jim, añadió, ¿tendrás tú miedo de la sangre?
--No, señor, le contesté.
--Está bien, replicó él; entonces ténme la palangana.
Tomó acto continuo su lanceta y con gran habilidad picó una vena.
Una gran cantidad de sangre salió antes de que el Capitán abriera los
ojos y echase en torno suyo una mirada vaga y anublada. Reconoció luego
al Doctor á quien miró con un ceño imposible de equivocar; en seguida me
miró á mí y mi presencia pareció aliviarlo un tanto. Pero de repente su
color cambió de nuevo; trató de enderezarse por sí solo y exclamó:
--¿Dónde está Black Dog?
--Aquí no hay ningún Black Dog, díjole el Doctor, como no sea el que
tiene Vd. dibujado sobre su espalda. Ha seguido Vd. bebiendo rom, y como
yo se lo había anticipado ha venido un ataque. Muy contra mi voluntad me
he visto obligado, por deber, á socorrerle, pudiendo decir que casi lo
he sacado á Vd. de la sepultura. Y ahora Maese Bones...
--Ese no es mi nombre, interrumpió él.
--No importa, replicó el Doctor, es el nombre de cierto filibustero á
quien yo conozco y le llamo á Vd. por él en gracia de la brevedad. Lo
único que tengo, pues, que añadir es esto: un vaso de rom no le haría á
Vd. ningún daño; pero si Vd. toma uno, tomará otro, y otro después, y
apostaría mi peluca á que, si no se contiene pronto y á tiempo, se
morirá muy en breve... ¿entiende Vd. esto...? se morirá y se irá al
mismísimo infierno, que es su propio lugar, como lo reza la Biblia.
Ahora, vamos, haga un esfuerzo. Yo le ayudaré, por esta vez, á llevarlo
á su cama.
Entre los dos, y no sin mucho trabajo, nos dimos trazas de llevarlo
arriba, á su cuarto y acostarlo sobre su lecho, en el cual dejó caer
pesadamente la cabeza sobre la almohada como si se sintiera desmayar.
--Ahora, recuérdelo bien, dijo el Doctor, para descargo de mi
conciencia debo repetirle que, para Vd. rom y muerte son dos palabras
que significan lo mismo.
Dicho esto se alejó de allí para ir á ver á mi padre, tomándome del
brazo para que me fuese con él.
--Eso no es nada, dijo en cuanto hubo cerrado tras de sí la puerta. Le
he sacado sangre suficiente para poderlo mantener bien por bastante
tiempo. Debe quedarse por una semana en cama: eso es lo menos malo para
él y para Vds.; pero un nuevo ataque le traerá la muerte
inevitablemente.

CAPÍTULO III
EL DISCO NEGRO
Á eso de medio día lleguéme al cuarto del Capitán llevándole algunos
refrigerantes y medicinas. Lo encontré acostado casi en la misma
posición en que lo habíamos dejado, nada más que un poco más hacia
arriba y me pareció al mismo tiempo débil y excitado.
--Jim, me dijo, tú eres aquí el único que vale algo y ya sabes muy bien
que yo siempre he sido bueno para contigo. Jamás he dejado de darte cada
mes cuidadosamente tu moneda de cuatro peniques. Ahora, pues,
chiquillo,... mira... yo me siento muy abatido, y abandonado de todo el
mundo... por lo mismo, Jim... vamos... ¿vas á traerme ahora mismo un
vasillo de rom, no es verdad?
--El Doctor... comencé yo.
Pero él me interrumpió en una voz débil aunque animada:
--Los médicos son todos unos lampazos,[2] dijo, y en cuanto á este de
acá, vaya,... ¿qué sabe él de hombres de mar? Yo he estado en lugares
tan calientes como un caldero de bréa, con mi tripulación diezmada por
la fiebre amarilla, y la condenada tierra bailando como si fuese un mar
con sus terremotos--¿qué sabe el Doctor de tierras como esa?--pues en
ellas he vivido sólo con el rom,--puedes creerlo bien. Él ha sido para
mí, bebida y alimento, cuerpo y sombra, sí señor, y si ahora no me han
de dar mi rom, ya no seré más que un pobre casco viejo abandonado en una
playa de sotavento... mi sangre caerá sobre tí, Jim, y sobre aquel
lampazo del Doctor.
Y luego continuó con lo mismo, por algún tiempo acompañándolo con
maldiciones; hasta que después, cambiando de táctica, prosiguió en tono
plañidero:
--Mira, Jim, cómo se agitan mis dedos; no puedo ya ni sosegarlos, ni
sosegarme... es que en todo este bendito día no he probado ni una gota
aún, ¡ni una sola gota! Ese Doctor está loco, puedes creérmelo. Si no se
me da ahora mismo un poco de rom, siento que me dará la rabia... ya creo
sentir en este momento algunos de sus horrores, algunas de sus
visiones... allí estoy viendo al viejo Flint, en ese rincón... allí...
detrás de tí, tan claro como su imagen viva... ¡oh! si me cojen estas
visiones, soy hombre que ha vivido una vida bastante ruda y resucitaré á
Caín! Tu mismo Doctor dijo que un vaso no me haría ningún daño. Te daré
una guinea de oro por uno sólo, Jim.
Yo ví que el Capitán se ponía más y más excitado y esto me alarmó por mi
padre que estaba más grave aquel día y necesitaba mucha quietud; además,
tranquilizado por las palabras mismas del Doctor que se me recordaban,
aunque un poco ofendido por aquel ofrecimiento de soborno le dije:
--Yo no necesito su dinero sino el que le debe Vd. á mi padre. Voy á
traerle un vaso, pero no pida más porque sería inútil.
Cuando se lo hube traído lo asió con verdadera ansiedad y lo bebió de un
sorbo.
--¡Ay, ay, ay! dijo como sintiendo un grande alivio, esto ya es algo
mejor, sin duda alguna. Y ahora bien, chico, ¿ha dicho ese Doctor cuanto
tiempo tengo que estar acostado en este viejo camarote?
--Una semana, por lo menos, le respondí.
--¡Mil carronadas! gritó él, ¡una semana! Esto es imposible. En ese
tiempo podrían ellos enviarme su disco negro. En este mismo momento ya
los vagabundos esos enderezan su proa y tratan de habérselas conmigo;
vagabundos que no sabrían conservar lo que cogieron y que quieren arañar
lo que pertenece á otro. ¡Vayan noramala! ¿es esa una conducta digna de
marinos? quiero saberlo. Pero soy un bendito. Yo jamás he derrochado un
buen dinero mío, ni lo he perdido tampoco. Yo sabré pegárselas una vez
más. No les tengo miedo; les soltaré otro rizo y ya los haré virar de
bordo, chico, ¡ya lo verás!
En tanto que hablaba así se había ido levantado de la cama, aunque con
gran dificultad, agarrándose--es la palabra--agarrándose á mi hombro con
una presión tan fuerte que casi me hizo llorar y moviendo sus piernas
como si fuesen un peso muerto. Sus palabras que, como se ve, estaban
rebosando un pensamiento activo y lleno de vida contrastaban tristemente
con la debilidad de la voz en que eran pronunciadas. Cuando se hubo
sentado en el borde de la cama se detuvo un poco y luego murmuró:
--Ese Doctor me ha hundido... los oídos me zumban... acuéstame otra
vez.
Antes de que hubiera hecho gran cosa para complacerlo, él había caído ya
de espaldas, en su posición anterior, en la cual permaneció silencioso
por algún rato.
--Jim, me dijo al cabo, ¿viste hoy á ese marinero?
--¿Á Black Dog? le pregunté.
--¡Ah! ¡Black Dog! exclamó él. Black Dog es un perverso, pero hay
alguien peor que lo obliga á serlo. Ahora bien, si no me es posible
marcharme de aquí, de ninguna manera, y si me envían el disco negro,
acuérdate que lo que ellos buscan es mi viejo cofre de á bordo... Montas
en un caballo.. ¿lo harás, no es cierto?... montas en un caballo y vas á
ver... pues, sí... no tiene remedio... á ese eterno Doctor del diablo, y
le dirás que se dé prisa á reunir á todas sus gentes... magistrados y
cosas por el estilo... y que haga rumbo con ellos y los traiga aquí á
bordo del "_Almirante Benbow_"... lo mismo que á todo lo que haya
quedado de la vieja tripulación de Flint, hombres y grumetes. Yo fuí
primer piloto, sí, primer piloto del viejo Capitán Flint, y soy el único
que conoce el sitio verdadero. Él me lo descubrió en Savannah, cuando
estaba, como yo he estado hoy, próximo á la muerte. Pero tú no los
denunciarás á menos que logren hacerme llegar su disco negro, ó en caso
de que vuelvas á ver á ese Black Dog otra vez, ó á un marinero con una
pierna sola... á este sobre todos, Jim!
--Pero ¿qué significa eso del disco negro, Capitán? le pregunté.
--Esto no es más que una advertencia, chico, me contestó. Yo te lo
explicaré si ellos logran lo que quieren. Entretanto, Jim, ten siempre
tu ojo alerta y por mi honor te juro que tú serás mi socio á partes
iguales.
Divagó todavía un poco más, y su voz era á cada instante más y más
débil. Le dí, en seguida, su medicina, que él apuró como un niño, sin
hacer la más ligera observación y añadió luego:
--Si alguna vez un marino ha querido drogas, ese soy yo ahora.
Después de decir esto cayó en un sueño profundo, muy parecido al
desfallecimiento, y en ese estado lo dejé.
¿Qué es lo que yo debía haber hecho entonces para que todo hubiera
salido bien? No sé. Probablemente debí haber contado todo al Doctor,
porque el hecho es que yo me encontraba en una angustia mortal temiendo
que, cuando menos, se arrepintiera el Capitán de sus confidencias y
quisiera dar buena cuenta de mí. Pero lo que sucedió fué que mi pobre
padre murió casi repentinamente aquella noche, lo que me obligó á hacer
cualquiera otra cosa á un lado. Nuestra pesadumbre natural, las visitas
de los vecinos, los arreglos del funeral y todo el quehacer de la posada
que había que desempeñar en el interín, me tuvieron tan ocupado que
apenas si tuve tiempo para acordarme entonces del Capitán, mucho menos
para pensar en tenerle miedo.
Á la mañana siguiente, á lo que creo, bajó por sí solo á la sala, tomó
sus alimentos, como de costumbre, sólo que comió poco y, según me temo,
consumió todavía mayor cantidad de rom que de ordinario, porque él se
despachó por su propia mano en la cantina, enfurruñado y soplando por la
nariz, por lo cual ninguno se atrevía á contrariarlo. La noche víspera
del entierro, el Capitán estaba tan borracho como siempre y era, en
verdad, una cosa para sublevar contra él, en aquella casa sumida en el
luto y la desolación, oirle cantar su eterna y horrible cantinela
marina. Pero abatidos y tristes como estábamos, no dejaba de
preocuparnos la idea del peligro de muerte en que aquel hombre estaba,
tanto más cuanto que el Doctor fué violentamente llamado á muchas millas
de distancia de nuestra casa para asistir á un nuevo enfermo, y ya no
volvió á estar, como quien dice, al alcance de nuestra mano, después de
la muerte de mi padre. He dicho que el Capitán estaba débil, y la verdad
es que no sólo lo estaba, sino que parecía decaer más y más visiblemente
en vez de recuperar su salud. Yo le veía subir y bajar la escalera con
agitación; ya iba de la sala á la cantina, ya de la cantina á la sala;
ya se medio asomaba á la puerta exterior de la casa como para aspirar
las brisas salobres de la mar, sosteniéndose en las paredes, como para
no caer, y respirando fuerte y aprisa como un hombre que encumbra la
pendiente abrupta de una montaña. No volvió á conversar conmigo de una
manera especial, y yo creo buenamente que había olvidado sus
confidencias, pero su carácter se había vuelto más movible y dada su
debilidad de cuerpo, mucho más violento que nunca. Tenía ahora un
síntoma bien alarmante cuando estaba ebrio, y era el ponerse junto á sí,
sobre la mesa, su enorme alfange ó cuchilla, desenvainada. Pero con todo
esto, se preocupaba menos de los concurrentes y parecía absorto
enteramente en sus propios pensamientos, sin hablar casi para nada, pero
divagando un poco. Una vez, por ejemplo, con grandísima sorpresa nuestra
comenzó á dejar oir un canto diferente y nuevo para nosotros: era una
especie de sonatilla amorosa, de gente del campo, que él debió haber
aprendido en su primera juventud, antes de que se dedicara á la carrera
de marino.
Así pasaron las cosas hasta el día siguiente del entierro de mi padre.
Ese día, como á las tres de una tarde nebulosa, helada y desagradable
estaba yo parado hacía unos momentos á la puerta del establecimiento,
lleno de tristes y desconsoladoras ideas acerca de mi pobre padre,
cuando percibí á alguien que se acercaba por el camino lentamente. Era
un hombre completamente ciego, porque tentaleaba delante de sí con un
palo y llevaba puesta sobre sus ojos y nariz una gran venda verde.
Aparecía jorobado como bajo el peso de años ó enfermedad terrible y
vestía una vieja y andrajosa capa marina con capuchón, que le daba un
aspecto positivamente deforme y horroroso. Yo nunca he visto en mi vida
una figura más horripilante y espantable que aquella. Detúvose un
instante cerca de la posada y levantando la voz en un tono de canturria
extraña y gangosa lanzó al viento esta relación:
--¿Querrá alguna alma caritativa, informar á un pobrecito ciego que ha
perdido el don preciosísimo de su vista en la defensa voluntaria de su
patria Inglaterra--así bendiga Dios al Rey Jorge--en dónde ó en qué
parte de este país se encuentra ahora?
--Está Vd. en la posada del "_Almirante Benbow_," caleta del Black Hill,
buen hombre, le dije yo.
--Oigo una voz, una voz de joven, me replicó él. ¿Quisiera Vd. darme su
mano y guiarme adentro, mi bueno y amable niño?
Tendíle mi mano y en un instante aquella horrible criatura sin vista,
que tan dulce hablaba, se apoderó de ella como con una garra. Asustéme
tanto que pugné por desasirme, pero el ciego me atrajo poderosamente
junto a sí con sola una contracción de su brazo.
--Ahora, muchacho, díjome, llévame á donde está el Capitán.
--Señor, le contesté, bajo mi palabra le aseguro que no me atrevo.
--¡Oh! replicó él con una risita burlona, llévame en el acto ó te
destrozo el brazo.
Y así como lo dijo, me dió un apretón tan horrible que me obligó á
lanzar un grito.
--Señor, añadí entonces, si no me atrevo, es sólo por Vd. El Capitán ya
no es el mismo que era antes. Ahora tiene siempre junto á sí una
cuchilla desenvainada. Otro caballero...
--¡Vamos, vamos, en marcha! me interrumpió el ciego, con una voz tan
áspera, tan fría, tan ingrata y tan espantable como no he vuelto á oir
jamás otra en mi vida. Ella me atemorizó más todavía que el dolor que
antes sentí, así es que sin vacilar le obedecí, llevándolo directamente
adentro, hacia la sala, en donde nuestro viejo y enfermo filibustero
permanecía sentado, entregado á su vicio de tomar rom. El ciego se
mantenía apretado á mí, sujetándome como con una tenaza férrea, en su
mano formidable, y dejando cargar sobre mí, más peso de su cuerpo, del
que yo podía razonablemente soportar.
--Llévame derecho á donde él está, me repitió, y cuando ya esté yo á su
vista, grítale: "Bill, aquí esta uno de sus amigos." Si no lo haces así
yo te repetiré este juego; y diciendo esto volvió á retorcerme el brazo
de una manera tan brutal y dolorosa que creí que iba á desmayarme. Con
una y otra cosa fué tal el terror que me cogió por el mendigo ciego que
me olvidé de todo mi antiguo miedo al Capitán y, tan luego como abrí la
puerta de la sala exclamé como se me había ordenado:
--¡Bill, aquí está uno de sus amigos!
El pobre Capitán levantó los ojos y le bastó la primera ojeada para que
su cabeza quedara instantáneamente libre de los humos del rom que había
alojado en ella y se pusiera de todo punto natural y despejada. La
expresión de su rostro no era tanto ya de terror como de mortal y
angustiosa agonía. Hizo un movimiento para ponerse en pie, pero no creo
que le quedara ya fuerza suficiente en el cuerpo para realizarlo.
--Veamos, Bill, díjole el mendigo, no hay para que incomodarse; quédate
allí sentado en donde estás. Aunque yo no puedo ver, puedo oir, sin
embargo, hasta el movimiento de un dedo. No hablemos mucho; vamos al
asunto; negocio es negocio. Levanta tu mano izquierda... muchacho, toma
su mano izquierda por la muñeca y acércala á mi mano derecha...
Ambos obedecimos como fascinados, al pie de la letra, y noté entonces
que el ciego hacía pasar á la del Capitán algo que él traía en la mano
misma con que empuñaba su bastón. El Capitán apretó y cerró aquello en
la suya nerviosa y rápidamente.
--¡Ya está hecho! dijo entonces el ciego y al pronunciar estas palabras
se desasió de mí bruscamente y con increíble exactitud y destreza,
salió, de por sí, fuera de la sala y se lanzó al camino real, sin que yo
hubiera podido todavía moverme del sitio en que me dejó, como
petrificado, cuando ya se había perdido á lo lejos el _tip-tap_ de su
caña tentaleando, á distancia, sobre la vía por donde marchaba.
Pasóse algún tiempo antes de que el Capitán y yo volviéramos á nuestros
sentidos, pero al cabo, y casi en el mismo momento, solté su puño, que
todavía tenía cogido; lanzó él una mirada ansiosa á lo que tenía en la
palma de la mano y en seguida exclamó poniéndose violentamente en pie:
--¡Á las diez!... ¡todavía es tiempo!
Al decir esto y ponerse en pie, vaciló como un hombre ebrio, llevóse
ambas manos á la garganta, se quedó oscilando por un momento, y luego,
con un rumor siniestro y peculiar, se desplomó cuan largo era, dando su
rostro en el suelo.
Yo me precipité hacia él, llamando á gritos á mi madre. Pero todo
apresuramiento era vano. El Capitán había caído ya muerto, acometido por
un ataque de apoplegía fulminante.
¡Cosa extraña y curiosa! Yo, que ciertamente no había tenido jamás
cariño por aquel hombre, por más que en sus últimos días me inspirase
una gran compasión, tan luego como lo ví muerto, rompí en un verdadero
mar de lágrimas. Aquella era la segunda muerte que yo veía y el dolor de
la primera estaba todavía demasiado reciente en mi corazón.

CAPÍTULO IV
EL COFRE DEL MUERTO
Sin perder un instante, por supuesto, hice entonces lo que quizás debí
haber hecho mucho tiempo antes, que fué contar á mi madre todo lo que
sabía, y desde luego ví que nos encontrábamos en una posición sobre
manera difícil. Parte del dinero de aquel hombre--si alguno tenía--se
nos debía á nosotros evidentemente; pero no era muy presumible que los
extraños y siniestros camaradas del Capitán, sobre todo, aquellos dos
que ya me eran conocidos, consintieran en deshacerse de parte del botín
que pensaban repartirse, por pagar las deudas del hombre muerto. La
orden que el Capitán me había dado, como se recordará, de que saltase al
punto sobre un caballo y corriese en busca del Doctor Livesey hubiera
dejado á mi madre sola y sin protección, por lo cual no había que pensar
en ello. La verdad es que nos parecía imposible á ambos el permanecer
mucho tiempo en la casa: los rumores más comunes é insignificantes como
el carbón cayendo en las hornillas del fogón de la cocina, el tic-tac
del reloj de pared y otros por el estilo, nos llenaban, en aquellas
circunstancias, de terror supersticioso. Las inmediaciones de la casa
nos parecían llenar el aire con el ruido apagado de pisadas cautelosas
que se acercaban, así es que, entre aquel cadáver del pobre Capitán,
yaciendo sobre el piso de la sala, y el recuerdo de aquel detestable y
horroroso pordiosero ciego, rondando quizás muy cerca y tal vez pronto á
volver, hubo momentos en que, como dice un adagio vulgar, no me llegaba
la camisa al cuerpo. Había, pues, que tomar una resolución pronta,
cualquiera que fuese, y al fin nos ocurrió irnos juntos y pedir socorro
en la aldea cercana. Todo fué decir y hacer. Aun cuando estábamos con la
cabeza toda trastornada, no vacilamos en correr, sin tardanza, enmedio
de la tarde que declinaba y de la espesa y helada niebla que todo lo
envolvía.
La aldea, aunque no se veía desde nuestra posada, no estaba, sin
embargo, sino á una distancia de pocos centenares de yardas, al otro
lado de la caleta vecina, y--lo que era para mí un grandísimo
consuelo--en dirección opuesta de la que el mendigo ciego había hecho su
aparición, y probablemente de la que también había seguido en su
retirada. No tardamos mucho tiempo en el camino, por más que algunas
veces nos deteníamos repegándonos el uno al otro para prestar oído. Pero
no percibimos ruido alguno anormal; nada que no fuese el vago y suave
rumor de la marea y los últimos graznidos y aleteos postreros de los
habitantes de la selva.
Acababa de oscurecer cuando llegamos á la aldea, y jamás olvidaré lo
mucho que me animó el ver en puertas y ventanas el brillo amarillento de
las luces; aunque ¡ay! como muy pronto iba á verlo, aquel era el único
auxilio que podíamos esperar por aquel lado. Porque no hubo un alma--por
más vergonzoso que esto sea para los hombres aquellos--no hubo un alma
que consintiera en acompañarnos de vuelta á la posada. Mientras más
detallábamos nuestras cuitas, más veíamos que hombres, mujeres y niños
se aferraban en quedarse al abrigo de sus propios hogares. El nombre del
Capitán Flint, por más que para mí fuese completamente extraño, era
bastante conocido para algunos de aquellos campesinos y bastaba él solo
para llevar á sus corazones un gran peso de terror. Algunos de aquellos
hombres que habían estado trabajando en el campo, en las cercanías del
"_Almirante Benbow_," recordaban, además, haber visto varios extraños en
el camino y tomándolos por contrabandistas, los habían obligado á
alejarse; otro aseguraba, por lo menos, haber visto una especie de bote
de vela cuadrada, en la parte de la costa que llamamos Caleta del Gato.
Por lo visto, cualquiera que fuese un simple camarada del Capitán era
bastante para producir un terror mortal á aquellas gentes. Y aun cuando
después de muchas vueltas y revueltas encontramos á algunos dispuestos á
montar é ir á prevenir al Doctor Livesey de lo que pasaba, para lo cual
tenían que ir en otra dirección, lo cierto es que ninguno quiso venir á
ayudarnos á defender la posada.
Se dice comunmente que el miedo es contagioso; pero por otro lado, la
elocuencia es una gran alentadora, así es que, cuando cada uno hubo
dicho su opinión, mi madre les dijo un pequeño discurso.
--Yo declaro, dijo entre otras cosas, que jamás consentiré en perder un
dinero que pertenece á mi huérfano hijo, y si ninguno de Vds. se atreve
á ayudarme, Jim y yo nos atrevemos á todo. Ahora mismo nos volvemos por
donde hemos venido y pocas gracias doy á Vds. camastrones,
desentrañados, corazones de pollo. Nosotros solos abriremos esa maleta,
aunque deba costarme la vida mi atrevimiento. Gracias mil á Vd., Sra.
Crossley, por este saquillo que me ha prestado en el cual traeré mi "muy
mío" y muy legítimo dinero.
Es claro que yo dije que iría con mi madre, y claro es también que todas
aquellas gentes protestaron contra nuestra temeridad; pero con todo y
eso, no hubo un hombre solo que se resolviera á acompañarnos. Todo lo
más que hicieron fué darme una pistola cargada por si acaso nos atacaban
y prometernos que tendrían listos caballos ensillados para el caso de
que fuésemos perseguidos en nuestra vuelta, y entre tanto un muchacho
corría ya en busca del Doctor para pedir auxilio armado.
Mi corazón latía violentamente cuando mi madre y yo volvíamos, solos de
nuevo, en medio de aquella noche helada, para afrontar tan temible y
peligrosa aventura. La luna llena comenzaba á levantar su disco rojizo
sobre las vagas siluetas de las nieblas del horizonte, lo cual nos
impelía á acelerar el paso, porque era evidente que antes de mucho rato,
y antes de que volviésemos de nuevo, todo estaría ya inundado con una
claridad como de día, y nuestra partida quedaría expuesta, por lo mismo,
á los ojos investigadores de nuestros vigilantes enemigos. Deslizámonos
cautelosamente á lo largo de los setos y vallados, sin hacer el menor
ruido y no vimos ni oímos nada que fuese parte á aumentar nuestras
zozobras, hasta que, al fin, con gran consuelo nuestro, la puerta de la
posada se cerró tras de nosotros, que estábamos, al cabo, en ella.
Corrí instintivamente el cerrojo tan luego como entramos, y nos
quedamos, por un momento, enmedio de la oscuridad, jadeando y
palpitantes, solos, sin más compañía que el cadáver del Capitán. Mi
madre enseguida fué al mostrador y tomó una bugía, y cogidos ambos de
las manos nos introdujimos á la sala. El muerto estaba allí, tal como lo
habíamos dejado, con sus ojos abiertos y un brazo echado hacia fuera.
--Baja el trasparente, Jim, murmuró mi madre; podría suceder que
viniesen á espiarnos desde afuera. Y ahora--añadió cuando su orden
estaba ejecutada--tenemos que buscar la llave de _eso_, y ya veremos
quien es el que lo coje. Y al decir esto exhaló algo como un suspiro ó
un sollozo.
Púseme de rodillas inmediatamente. En el suelo, muy cerca de la mano del
difunto me encontré en el acto un disco pequeño de papel, ennegrecido de
un lado. No pude dudar de que esto fuese el disco negro á que él se
había referido y levantándolo, encontré escrito, al otro lado, en letra
muy buena y muy clara, esta intimación demasiado lacónica. "Se le da á
Vd. de plazo hasta las diez, de esta noche."
--Se le da hasta las diez, madre, dije, y no bien acababa de pronunciar
estas palabras cuando nuestro viejo reloj crujió para dar una hora, y
comenzó á sonar pausadamente sus campanadas, haciéndonos extremecer con
un movimiento involuntario...
--¡Una... dos... tres... cuatro... cinco... seis! Las seis! son las seis
apenas... tenemos tiempo, Jim, dijo mi madre. Ahora, veamos; esa llave!
Busqué en cada una de sus bolsas: algunas pequeñas monedas, un dedal, un
poco de hilo, agujas gruesas, un pedazo de tabaco de pipa, su navaja de
mango corvo, una brújula de bolsillo, y una cajita con eslabón y yesca
fué todo lo que en ellas encontré y ya comenzaba, por lo mismo, á
desesperar.
--Tal vez la lleve colgada al cuello, sugirió mi madre.
Sobreponiéndome á una gran repugnancia me resolví á abrirle la camisa y
allí, desde luego, suspensa de un sucio cordoncillo embreado que me dí
prisa á cortar con su propia navaja, estaba la llave que tanto
buscábamos. Con esta primera victoria nos sentimos llenos de valor y de
esperanza y nos apresuramos á subir á la habitación del difunto, en la
que había dormido por tan largo tiempo y en la cual su cofre de á bordo
había permanecido desde el día de su llegada.
Era aquella una maleta marina, común y corriente, como la de otro
navegante cualquiera, solo que por fuera llevaba esta inicial B hecha
con un hierro candente, y las esquinas aparecían un poco rotas y
estropeadas como por un uso largo y nada cuidadoso.
--Dame esa llave, dijo mi madre; y aun cuando la chapa estaba muy dura y
en poco uso, ella la había ya abierto y levantado la tapa de la maleta,
en un abrir y cerrar de ojos.
Un fuerte olor á tabaco y á bréa salió inmediatamente del interior, pero
nada pudimos ver en el compartimiento de arriba, con excepción de un
traje de muy buena tela cuidadosamente cepillado y doblado que, según
dijo mi madre, jamás debió haber sido usado. Bajo de él comenzaba la
miscelánea: un cuadrante, una cajilla de hoja de lata, varios palillos
de tabaco, dos pares de muy buenas y hermosas pistolas, un pedacillo de
barra de plata, un antiguo reloj español y algunas otras baratijas de
muy poco valor, en su mayor parte de estructura extranjera, un par de
brújulas montadas en latón y cinco ó seis extrañas y curiosas conchas de
los mares de las Indias Occidentales. Con frecuencia me he maravillado
después pensando para qué había venido trayendo y guardando aquellos
mariscos, en el discurso de su azarosa, culpable y agitada vida.
Entre tanto, nada que valiese la pena habíamos encontrado, excepto la
barrilla y las baratijas de plata, que por cierto no era lo que nosotros
buscábamos. Debajo había un viejo capote de á bordo, blanqueado con las
sales marinas, que mi madre levantó con impaciencia y que descubrió á
nuestra vista las últimas cosas del contenido de la maleta. Eran estas,
un paquete ó liazo de papeles, envueltos cuidadosamente en tela
impermeable, y una talega de cáñamo, que nos bastó menear para que su
sonido nos dijese que contenía oro.
--Yo les probaré á esos pícaros, prorrumpió mi madre, que soy una mujer
honrada. Tomaré de aquí lo que se nos debe y ni un solo penique más. Ten
el saquillo de la Sra. Crossley; y diciendo esto comenzó á contar
escrupulosamente el monto de lo adeudado, pasando las monedas de la
talega del Capitán al saquillo que yo sostenía abierto con mis manos.
Fué aquella una operación larga y difícil porque las monedas eran de
todos los países y de todos los cuños imaginables. Doblones y luises de
oro, guineas y piezas de á ocho, y no sé cuantas otras más, todas
mezcladas unas con otras y en montón. Las guineas, además, eran las
menos abundantes, y ellas eran las únicas con que mi madre sabía contar.
Estaríamos como á la mitad de nuestra tarea, cuando súbitamente tuve que
poner mi mano sobre su brazo, para imponerle silencio, porque acababa
de oir enmedio de la atmósfera fría y callada, un rumor que hizo que el
corazón me latiera de nuevo hasta querer salírseme por la boca: era el
formidable _tap-tap_ del bastón del ciego mendigo golpeando sobre la
superficie helada del camino. Lo oí que se acercaba más y más, en tanto
que nosotros procurábamos contener hasta la respiración. Por fin golpeó
con firmeza en la puerta de la posada y luego oímos distintamente que
hacía jugar la perilla de fuera de la cerradura, y el cerrojo crujía con
los esfuerzos que aquel miserable hacía para entrar. Hubo, enseguida, un
silencio largo y angustioso tanto afuera como adentro de la casa. Por
fin el _tap-tap_ del bastón comenzó de nuevo y, con alegría
indescriptible de nuestra parte, acabó por irse extinguiendo á lo lejos
lentamente hasta que, por último, cesó de oirse por completo.
--Madre, le dije yo, tómelo Vd. todo de una vez y vámonos. Parecíame que
la puerta con el cerrojo echado debió de excitar las sospechas de aquel
hombre y que probablemente nos echaría encima á todo su nido de
gavilanes. Por lo demás, nadie que no se haya visto en presencia de
aquel terrible ciego puede explicarse cuánto me felicité de haber tenido
antes la ocurrencia instintiva de correr el cerrojo cuando entramos.
Empero mi madre, azorada como estaba, no quiso consentir en tomar ni un
céntimo más de lo que se nos debía; pero también se obstinó en no
contentarse con menos.
--Todavía no han dado las siete, dijo; falta mucho aún: yo sé lo que me
corresponde y lo quiero á todo trance.
Todavía estaba discutiendo conmigo cuando un ligero silbido llegó hasta
nosotros, lanzado, á buena distancia, sobre la loma. Aquello era
bastante y más que bastante para nosotros dos.
--Me llevaré lo que he contado, dijo mi madre poniéndose violentamente
en pie.
--Y yo tomo esto para redondear la cuenta, agregué apoderándome del lío
de papeles, envueltos en tela impermeable.
Un instante después, ambos bajábamos á toda prisa la escalera, dejando
la vela junto al baúl vacío, y no tardamos sino pocos segundos en abrir
la puerta exterior y ponernos en plena retirada. Un minuto más de
dilación y hubiera sido ya demasiado tarde. La niebla se estaba
desbaratando rápidamente y ya la luna brillaba con toda su claridad en
la parte elevada del terreno, á uno y otro lado nuestro, y apenas se
quedaba ya un ténue velo á la orilla de la hondonada y á las puertas de
la taberna para favorecer con su gasa, todavía no rota, los primeros
pasos de nuestra fuga. Mucho antes de que hubiéramos podido llegar á la
mitad del camino que lleva á la aldea, muy poco más allá del pie de la
loma, debíamos penetrar forzosamente en el espacio claro y descubierto,
alumbrado por la luna. Y aun esto no era todo: el rumor de pasos
numerosos que se acercaban en tropel llegó hasta nuestros oídos, y al
mirar en dirección de ellos, pudimos notar á causa de las oscilaciones
de una lucecilla y de su rápida aproximación, que uno de los que se
acercaban traía consigo una linterna.
--Hijo mío, díjome mi madre de repente, toma el dinero y escápate
corriendo. Yo siento que voy á desmayarme.
Esto sí que era el fin de todo para nosotros, al menos así lo pensé yo.
¡Cuánto no execré en aquel momento, la cobardía de los vecinos; cuánto
no desaprobé á mi pobre madre por su honradez y su avaricia, lo mismo
que por su pasado atrevimiento y su extrema debilidad en aquella hora!
Nos encontrábamos, por nuestra gran fortuna en aquel instante sobre el
pequeño puente; yo la sostuve lo mejor que pude, vacilante como estaba,
hasta la extremidad de la ribera, en donde exhaló un suspiro y se dejó
caer sobre mi hombro. No podré decir ahora cómo encontré en mí fuerzas
bastantes para hacer lo que hice en aquellas críticas circunstancias, y
aun me temo que lo que ejecuté lo llevé á cabo con alguna brusquedad; el
hecho es que me dí trazas para hacerla bajar conmigo el paredón de la
hondanada y casi arrastréla de manera de colocarnos un tanto cuanto bajo
el arco del mismo puente. Nada más pude hacer después de esto, porque el
puentecillo era demasiado bajo para permitirnos otra cosa que el
acurrucarme á mí debajo de él, dejando á mi madre casi enteramente
afuera; pero quedando ambos á tan corta distancia de la posada que
podíamos oir claramente lo que se hablara en ella.

CAPÍTULO V
DEL FIN QUE TUVO EL MENDIGO CIEGO
Mi curiosidad, empero, pudo más que mis temores: comprendí que el
permanecer allí donde estaba no me traía más utilidad que la de pasarme
agazapado, Dios sabe cuanto tiempo, por lo cual trepé como pude, una vez
más al paredón del barranco y ocultando mi cabeza entre un sotillo de
retamas pude colocarme en posición de dominar desde allí toda la parte
del camino que pasa frente á nuestra puerta. Apenas había logrado
acomodarme cuando los enemigos comenzaron á llegar en número de siete ú
ocho, á toda carrera, golpeando con sus pies el sendero
descompasadamente y trayendo al frente de ellos al hombre de la
linterna, á pocos pasos á vanguardia. Tres hombres corrían juntos,
cogidos de las manos, y yo comprendí luego, aun á través de la niebla,
que el que formaba el centro del trío, no era otro que mi formidable
mendigo ciego. Un momento después su voz me probó que no me había
equivocado.
--¡Abajo la puerta! gritó.
--Bien, bien, señor! contestaron dos ó tres de los asaltantes los cuales
se precipitaron en tropel sobre la puerta de la posada, seguidos por el
hombre de la linterna; pero muy luego los ví detenerse y cambiar
algunas palabras en voz baja, como sorprendidos de haber encontrado
abierta la misma entrada que se proponían forzar. Pero su sorpresa fué
muy pasajera: el ciego volvió á lanzar sus órdenes oyéndose su voz más
fuerte y más levantada, como si se sintiera encendido por un grande
anhelo y una violenta rabia al mismo tiempo.
--¡Adentro, adentro, adentro! les gritaba, no sin proferir maldiciones y
juramentos por lo que á él le parecía tardanza.
Cuatro ó cinco de ellos se apresuraron á obedecer, permaneciendo dos en
el sendero, al lado de aquel mendigo formidable. Hubo otra pausa no muy
larga y tras ella resonó una exclamación de sorpresa, seguida por una
voz que clamó desde adentro:
--¡Bill ha muerto!
Pero el ciego lanzóles un tremendo y nuevo juramento por su poca
diligencia, añadiendo:
--Regístrelo alguno de Vds., tramposos, vagabundos, y ¡los demás arriba
y á bajarse la maleta!
Hasta mi escondite llegaba el ruido de las pisadas de aquellos hombres
en los peldaños de madera de nuestra escalera, por tanto, es seguro que
la casa entera debía retemblar con ellas. En el momento se siguieron
nuevas exclamaciones de sorpresa: la ventana del cuarto del Capitán fué
abierta de par en par con un empujón violento acompañado de ruido de
vidrios que se rompían. Un hombre apareció en ella, iluminado por la luz
plena de la luna y se dirijió al mendigo ciego que se encontraba, como
he dicho, en el camino y precisamente debajo de la ventana recién
abierta.
--Pew, le gritó, nos han ganado por la mano. Alguien ha registrado ya la
maleta, de arriba á abajo.
--¿Está _eso_ allí? preguntó.
--El dinero, sí, contestó el de arriba.
--¡Carguen mil diablos contigo y el dinero! lo que yo pregunto es si
está allí el manuscrito de Flint, ¡bergante!
--Por lo que hace á aquí, no hay nada replicó el otro.
--Bueno, bajen Vds., y vean si está sobre el cadáver de Bill.
En ese momento, otro de los de la partida, probablemente el que se había
quedado en la sala registrando el cuerpo del Capitán, apareció en la
puerta de la posada diciendo:
--Bill ha sido ya registrado antes: nada han dejado sobre él.
--Han sido las gentes de la posada, ha sido ese muchacho. De buena gana
le hubiera sacado yo los ojos, rugió el ciego Pew. No ha mucho que
estaban aquí todavía: tenían el cerrojo puesto cuando yo quise entrar.
¡Á registrar, muchachos, á registrar y á encontrarlos!
--Lo único que nos han dejado aquí es su vela, dijo el de la ventana.
--¡Pues á la obra, á la obra! ¡á registrar y á dar con ellos! dijo de
nuevo Pew, golpeando airadamente con su palo sobre el suelo.
Siguióse entonces una gran batahola, un vaivén indecible adentro de la
casa; ruidos de pisadas toscas resonaban de un lado y otro; rumor de
muebles arrojados al suelo; puertas abiertas á puntapiés, hasta que las
rocas repitieron con sus ecos aquel ruido infernal. Vióse entonces á
todos aquellos hombres salir al camino, uno tras de otro, declarando
que nada les quedaba que registrar y que, de fijo, no estábamos ocultos
dentro de la casa. En aquel instante el mismo silbido que tanto nos
había alarmado á mi madre y á mí, cuando operábamos sobre el dinero del
difunto Capitán, volvió á oirse clara y distintamente enmedio de la
noche, pero en esta ocasión, dos veces repetido. Yo había creído que ese
sonido era algo como la trompeta del ciego, ordenando con ella á su
tripulación el lanzarse al abordaje, pero entonces comprendí que no era
sino una señal soltada sigilosamente del lado de la loma en dirección de
la aldea y, según el efecto que ella produjo en nuestros filibusteros,
era un aviso preventivo de algún peligro cercano.
--Dirk ha silbado, dijo uno... y dos veces! ¡tenemos que ponernos en
franquía!
--¡Ponte en franquía al infierno, mandria! gritóle Pew. Dirk se ha
manifestado desde un principio cobarde y tonto, y Vds., no deben hacerle
caso. Esas gentes deben estar por aquí, muy cerca, tenemos la mano sobre
ellas, con seguridad. Revolver todo, registrarlo todo... ¿á qué hemos
venido, si nó, perros de Satanás? ¡Oh! ¡por vida del diablo!... ¡si
tuviera yo mis ojos...!
Estas exclamaciones parecieron producir algún efecto, pues dos de los de
la banda comenzaron á registrar aquí y acullá, entre las duelas y
trastos que había por allí afuera, pero con muy poca resolución, según
me pareció y siempre teniendo un ojo listo para escapar al peligro que
temían, mientras que los restantes estaban aún indecisos y vacilantes en
el camino.
--¡Ah, imbéciles! clamaba el ciego; tienen Vds. las manos puestas sobre
millares de millares ¡y se están allí como idiotas, con los brazos
cruzados! Todos Vds. pueden hacerse en un momento tan ricos como reyes
con solo encontrar eso que muy bien saben que está por aquí, á su
alcance, ¡y ninguno quiere hacer su obligación! ¡Mandrias! ¡mandrias!
ninguno de Vds. se atrevió á presentarse á Bill, y tuve que resolverme á
hacerlo yo... ¡un ciego! ¡Pues bien yo no quiero perder la suerte que me
toca, por culpa de Vds.! ¡Qué! ¿voy á seguir siendo toda la vida un
pordiosero que se arrastra, chicaneando y trampeando por un miserable
vaso de rom, cuando debo y puedo rodar en coches magníficos? ¡Si esas
gentes se volvieran ojo de hormiga, todavía deberían Vds. encontrarlas!
--Cierra tu escotilla, Pew, gruñó uno de ellos, ya hemos pescado los
doblones.
--Es seguro que ellos habrán escondido bien el maldito lío, saltó otro.
Pero no perdamos tiempo; toma tú los Jorges,[3] Pew, y no estés allí
chillando.
Chillando era la palabra verdadera, y al oirla la muy mal contenida
cólera del ciego hizo explosión, excitada ya por las objeciones
precedentes, de tal suerte y tan furiosamente, que su excitación se
sobrepuso á todo; así fué que, empuñando su grueso bastón, arremetió con
él á sus secuaces, golpeando con rabia á derecha é izquierda, á pesar de
su ceguera, y dejándose oir sus tremendos golpes sobre más de alguno de
los más próximos á él.
Estos, á su vez, respondieron vomitando las más horribles injurias y
amenazas sobre el perverso ciego, y se lanzaron sobre él á pretender
apoderarse del garrote, retorciéndoselo en su poderoso puño.
Esta riña fué para nosotros la salvación, pues todavía estaban empeñados
en ella aquellos hombres, cuando un nuevo ruido se dejó oir hacia la
cumbre de la loma, por el lado de la aldea, y era el galope tendido de
varios caballos. Casi en el mismo instante un pistoletazo partió del
lado del vallado, percibiéndose simultáneamente la luz y el trueno del
disparo. Aquello era, evidentemente, la última señal de peligro, porque
los filibusteros se pusieron en fuga, en el instante, en una precipitada
carrera de "sálvese quien pueda." Todos corrieron en dirección
diferente: el uno rumbo al mar; otro hacia la caleta; otro oblícuamente
por la loma y así de los demás, de tal manera que en menos tiempo del
que lo cuento, no quedaban ya ni trazas de ellos, excepto el ciego Pew.
En cuanto á éste, lo habían abandonado, no sabré decir si por el pánico
que de ellos se apoderó, ó en venganza de sus injurias y garrotazos. El
hecho es que él estaba allí, detrás de todos, tentaleando sobre el
camino con su bastón, loca y desesperadamente, y llamando á gritos á sus
camaradas fugitivos. Finalmente tomó la peor dirección para él, rumbo á
la aldea, y pasó á muy pocos pasos de mi escondite clamando
frenéticamente:
--Juanillo, Black Dog, Dirk, y otros nombres más.... Vds. no dejarán
aquí á su viejo Pew, compañeros... ¡no dejarán á su pobre Pew!
En aquel instante el ruido de los caballos llegó á la cumbre y cuatro ó
cinco ginetes aparecieron sobre la loma, alumbrados claramente por la
luna y se precipitaron á galope tendido hacia abajo, por el declive.
Entonces Pew comprendió su error; trató de volverse prorrumpiendo en una
maldición y se dirijió hacia la zanja en la cual rodó. Pero en un
segundo ya se había puesto en pie de nueva cuenta é intentó un nuevo
escape; pero descarriado ya como estaba, no hizo más que ir á colocarse
precisamente bajo el más próximo de los caballos que se acercaban. El
ginete trató de salvarlo; pero fué en vano. El mendigo cayó, sin
remedio, atropellado por el bruto que lo echó por tierra y estampó sobre
él, despedazándolo, sus cuatro herrados y poderosos cascos. Pew dejó oir
un solo grito horrible y angustioso que se perdió en el silencio trágico
de la noche. Cayó sobre un costado, se volteó luego débilmente con el
rostro á tierra y no volvió á moverse nunca.
Yo me enderecé entonces y saludé cortésmente á los ginetes que ya se
disponían á retroceder, horrorizados por el accidente ocurrido. Pronto
me dí cuenta de quienes eran ellos. Uno, que venía aún detrás de todos,
era el muchacho que había ido de la aldea en busca del Doctor Livesey;
los demás eran aduaneros ó guardas fiscales que aquél había encontrado
en su camino y con los cuales se había entendido para regresar sin
pérdida de tiempo. La noticia de aquella extraña barca de vela cuadrada
surta en la Caleta del Gato, había llegado hasta el Inspector Dance que,
á consecuencia de ella, había resuelto hacer una excursión aquella noche
en dirección de nuestras playas, circunstancia, sin la cual, es seguro
que mi madre y yo habríamos perdido la vida.
En cuanto á Pew, estaba muerto y muy bien muerto. Por lo que hace á mi
madre, á quien condujimos á la aldea, algunas lociones de agua fría y
algunas sales que le hicimos aspirar le volvieron por completo el
conocimiento y aunque no quedó enteramente exhausta de ánimo por sus
terrores, sinembargo aún continuaba deplorando el resto del dinero que
no quiso tomar. En el interín, el Inspector apresuró su marcha, tanto
cuanto pudo, en dirección de la Caleta del Gato; pero sus guardas tenían
que desmontar y que ir marchando á tientas por las escabrosidades de la
cañada, llevando del diestro á los caballos, algunas veces
conteniéndolos y constantemente con el temor de una emboscada, por lo
mismo no fué cosa de sorprenderse el que, cuando llegaron al lugar en
que sabían que la barca estaba fondeada, ésta se hubiera hecho ya á la
mar, si bien estaba aún á cortísima distancia de la playa. Todavía la
voz del Inspector pudo llegar hasta los fugitivos, uno de los cuales le
gritó que se quitase de la luz de la luna porque podría ir á saludarle
un poco de plomo. No acababa de apagarse el eco de esta intimación
cuando silbó una bala de mosquete casi rozando el brazo de Dance y acto
continuo la embarcación dobló la punta de la caleta y desapareció. El
Inspector se quedó allí, según su propia expresión "como pez fuera del
agua" y todo lo más que pudo hacer fué enviar un hombre á Brístol para
prevenir el arribo posible de la falúa aquella, lo cual era lo mismo que
nada, en su opinión.
--Han salido salvos, añadió, y la cosa ha concluido allí. Solamente me
alegro mucho de que hayamos trillado al paso á Maese Pew, que de no ser
así ya hubiera recibido, á estas horas, noticias mías.
Volvíme entonces con él á la posada del "_Almirante Benbow_" y no podría
nadie imaginarse qué cuadro de trastorno y destrozo encontré en nuestra
casa. El reloj, con su gran caja de madera, había sido arrojado al
suelo por aquellos bárbaros en su desesperada cacería emprendida para
buscarnos á mi madre y á mí, y aun cuando es cierto que nada se habían
llevado á excepción del talego de dinero del Capitán y algunas monedas
de plata de nuestra gaveta, pude hacerme cargo, desde la primera ojeada
que dí, de que estábamos arruinados. El Inspector Dance no podía hacer
nada en aquel caos.
--Bueno, Jim, díjome; tú afirmas que ellos han cogido el dinero, ¿no es
así? entonces ¿qué fortuna era la que buscaban aquí? ¿más dinero tal
vez?
--No señor, no creo que fuese dinero, le contesté, lo cierto es que yo
creo tener aquí, en la bolsa de pecho de mi jubón lo que ellos buscaban
y quisiera, de buen grado, depositarlo desde luego en un lugar seguro.
--¿Para ponerlo á salvo, muchacho? me parece muy bueno, dijo. Yo me lo
llevaré si tú quieres.
--Yo pensaba, tal vez, que el Doctor Livesey... comencé yo.
--¡Excelente! ¡magnífico! me interrumpió él en muy plausible tono; tu
idea es immejorable; él es todo un caballero y todo un magistrado. Y
ahora que pienso en ello, yo también debo ir allá y dar cuenta, ya sea á
él, ya al Caballero Trelawney, de la muerte de ese Maese Pew, que ya no
tiene remedio. Y no es que yo la deplore, nó; sino que las gentes poco
benévolas podrían querer acriminar por ella á un oficial del fisco de Su
Majestad, si acriminación cupiere en este caso. Ahora, pues, Hawkins, si
tú quieres, puedo llevarte conmigo.
Le dí cordialmente las gracias por su ofrecimiento y nos fuimos á pie
otra vez á la aldea en donde estaban los caballos. Mientras fuí á
avisar á mi madre lo que iba yo á hacer ya las cabalgaduras estaban
ensilladas.
--Dogger, dijo el Sr. Dance, tú llevas allí un buen caballo, ponte á
este chiquillo en ancas.
No bien hube yo montado y asídome al cinturón de Dogger, el Inspector
dió la señal de partida y toda la caravana se puso en movimiento
saliendo al camino, á un trote bastante vivo, y cruzando el puente que
nos sirvió de escondite, rumbo á la casa del Doctor Livesey.

CAPÍTULO VI
LOS PAPELES DEL CAPITÁN
Caminamos bastante de prisa hasta que por fin nos detuvimos á la puerta
del Doctor Livesey. La casa estaba enteramente oscura en el exterior.
El Inspector Dance me dijo que me apeara y llamase á la puerta y Dogger
me dió uno de sus estribos para que bajara por él. La puerta se abrió
casi inmediatemente y apareció la criada.
--¿Está en casa el Doctor? le pregunté.
--Nó, me contestó, estuvo aquí en la tarde, pero volvió á salir rumbo á
la Universidad en donde iba á comer y á pasar la velada con el Caballero
Trelawney.
--Entonces, vamos allá, muchachos, dijo el Inspector.
Por esta vez, como la distancia que había que recorrer era muy corta, ya
no volví á montar, sino que marché teniéndome á la correa del estribo de
Dogger hasta el pabellón del conserje, y de allí arriba por la larga y
desnuda avenida, alumbrada á aquella hora por el resplandor de la luna,
y á cuyo término se veía, de uno y otro lado, en medio de viejos
jardines, la blanca silueta del grupo de edificios que forman la
Universidad. Aquí el Inspector Dance desmontó, y llevándome consigo,
obtuvo el permiso de pasar al interior del establecimiento para un
pequeño asunto.
El criado nos condujo á un pasillo esterado á cuyo extremo nos mostró la
gran biblioteca, toda forrada de inmensos estantes, coronados de bustos
de sabios de todas las edades. Allí encontramos al Caballero Trelawney y
al Doctor Livesey, charlando animadamente, puro en mano, á los lados de
un fuego alegre y brillante.
Hasta aquella noche no había yo tenido ocasión de ver de cerca al
Caballero Trelawney. Era un hombre alto, de más de seis pies de estatura
y de anchura proporcionada, con un rostro agreste, áspero y encarnado
que sus largos viajes habían puesto así, como forrado por una máscara.
Sus pupilas eran muy negras y se movían con gran vivacidad, lo cual le
daba la apariencia de poseer un temperamento, no diré malo, pero sí
violento y altivo.
--Pase Vd., Sr. Dance, dijo entonces, en un tono benévolo y amable.
--Buenas noches, Dance, dijo á su vez el Doctor con una inclinación de
cabeza. Y buenas noches, tú también, amigo Jim, ¿qué buenos vientos
traen á Vds. por acá?
El Inspector quedóse de pie, derecho y tieso como un veterano, y contó
lo acaecido como un estudiante que recita su lección. Era de verse cómo
aquellos dos caballeros se acercaban insensiblemente, y qué miradas se
dirijían el uno al otro, embargándoles la sorpresa de tal modo que hasta
se olvidaron por completo de fumar sus puros. Cuando se les refirió cómo
mi madre había vuelto sola conmigo á la posada, el Doctor se dió una
buena palmada en el muslo y el Caballero Trelawney exclamó:
--¡Bravo, bravo! y en su entusiasmo arrojó su excelente puro á la
chimenea. Mucho antes de que lo hiciera se había ya puesto de pie, y
medía á pasos agitados la habitación, en tanto que el Doctor, como si
esto le ayudara á oir mejor, se había arrancado la empolvada peluca y se
nos exhibía allí, haciendo una figura extrañísima, con su propio pelo
negro, cortado á peine, como se dice en términos de barbería.
Al fin el Inspector Dance concluyó su narración.
--Sr. Dance, dijo el Caballero, es Vd. un hombre de muy noble corazón.
En cuanto al hecho de haber atropellado á aquel perverso lo considero,
señor mío, como un acto meritorio, tal como el pisar sobre una alimaña
venenosa. Y por lo que hace á este buen mozalbete Hawkins, él ha sido
"triunfos" en este juego. Vamos, chicuelo, ¿quieres hacer el favor de
tirar el cordón de esa campanilla? Es preciso que obsequiemos al Sr.
Inspector con un buen vaso de cerveza.
--Por lo visto, Jim, ¿tú crées tener en tu poder lo que esos malvados
buscaban? interrogó el Doctor.
--Aquí lo tiene Vd., dije alargándole el paquete envuelto en tela
impermeable.
El Doctor lo tomó y le dió vueltas y más vueltas, como si sus dedos
danzaran con la impaciencia nerviosa de abrir aquello; pero en vez de
hacerlo así, depositó el paquete tranquilamente en su bolsillo.
--Caballero Trelawney, dijo, así que el Sr. Dance haya tomado su
cerveza, tiene, por fuerza, que salir de nuevo al servicio de Su
Magestad; pero en cuanto á Jim, me propongo hacerlo que se quede esta
noche á dormir en mi casa, así es que con su permiso, propondría yo que
le mandáramos dar una buena tajada de pastel frío para que cene.
--Como Vd. quiera, Livesey, dijo el Caballero, Hawkins se ha hecho
acreedor á algo mucho mejor que un pastel frío.
Dicho esto, me trajeron y colocaron en una mesita lateral un grande y
apetitoso pastel de pichón, con el cual me despaché concienzudamente y
muy á mi sabor, porque la verdad es que tenía yo tanta hambre como un
halcón. En el interín, el Sr. Dance recibía nuevos cumplidos, tomaba su
cerveza y concluía, al fin, por despedirse.
--Y ahora Caballero, dijo el Doctor...
--Y ahora, Livesey, exclamó el Caballero en el mismo tono.
Cada cosa á su tiempo, como lo reza un adagio, dijo el Doctor riendo;
¿Vd. ha oído hablar de ese Flint, á lo que creo?
--¡Oído hablar de él! exclamó el Caballero, oído hablar de él! Pues si
ha sido el más sanguinario filibustero que jamás ha cruzado el océano.
Barba-roja era un niño de pecho junto á él. Los españoles le tenían un
miedo tan horrible que, debo decirlo con franqueza, me sentía yo
orgulloso de que Flint fuese un inglés. Yo he visto, con mis propios
ojos, las gavias de su navío, á la altura de la _Trinidad_, y el
gallinazo hijo de borrachín con quien yo me había embarcado, hizo proa
atrás, refugiándose á toda prisa en Puerto-España.
--Está bien, dijo el Doctor, también yo he oído hablar de él en
Inglaterra; pero la cuestión es esta, ¿tenía dinero?
--¡Dinero! exclamó el Caballero Trelawney, ¡ha oído Vd. cosa! ¿pues
qué es lo que esos villanos buscaban sino dinero? ¿qué les importa á
ellos nada que no sea dinero? ¿y por qué otra cosa arriesgarían sus
viles pellejos que no fuese por dinero?
[Illustration: LOS PAPELES DEL CAPITÁN.
"Tanto el Caballero como yo estábamos ya observando..."]
--Eso lo veremos pronto, replicó el Doctor; pero Vd. está tan
extraordinariamente excitado y declamador que no acierto á sacar en
limpio nada de lo que deseo. Lo que yo quiero saber es esto: suponiendo
que tengo yo en mi bolsa, aquí, la llave para descubrir el punto en que
Flint ha sepultado su tesoro, ¿el tal tesoro será algo que valga la
pena?
--¡Que valga la pena! ¡Por San Jorge! Valdrá nada menos que esto: si
tenemos esa clave que Vd. sospecha, yo fletaré un buque en Brístol y
llevaré conmigo á Vd. y á Hawkins, y crea que desenterraré el tal tesoro
aunque deba buscar un año entero.
--Muy bien; ahora pues, si Jim consiente, abriremos este paquete, dijo
el Doctor poniéndolo sobre la mesa.
El lío estaba cosido, así fué que el Doctor tuvo que sacar de su estuche
unas tijeras y cortar las hebras que lo aseguraban. Dos cosas
aparecieron: un cuaderno y un papel sellado.
--Primero examinaremos el cuaderno, sugirió el Doctor.
--Tanto el Caballero como yo estábamos ya observando por encima de su
hombro cuando él lo abrió, pues por lo que hace á mí ya el mismo Doctor
me había antes invitado á que me acercase sin ceremonias, dejando la
mesa donde había cenado, para participar en el placer de la curiosa
investigación. En la primera página no había más que algunos rasgos de
manuscrito, como los que un hombre, con una pluma en la mano, puede
hacer por vía de práctica ó de entretenimiento. Una de las frases
escritas era la misma que el Capitán llevaba en los dibujos indelebles
de su brazo "Caprichos de Billy Bones." Luego se leía esto: "Maese W.
Bones, piloto," "No más rom," y "Cerca de Punta de Palma lo hubo" y
algunos otros motes y palabras sueltas, en su mayor parte
ininteligibles. No pude prescindir de que se excitara mi curiosidad
pensando quién sería el que _lo hubo_ y qué fué _lo que hubo_. Lo mismo
podía tratarse de una buena estocada en la espalda que de otra cosa
cualquiera.
--No sacaremos de aquí gran cosa en limpio, dijo el Doctor volviendo la
hoja.
Las diez ó doce páginas siguientes estaban llenas con una curiosa serie
de entradas. En la extremidad de cada una de las líneas se veía una
fecha, y en la otra una suma de dinero, como en los libros de cuentas
comunes y corrientes; pero en vez de palabras explicativas, sólo se
encontraba un número variable de cruces entre una y otra. En la fecha
marcada 12 de Junio de 1745, por ejemplo, se veía claramente que la
cantidad de setenta libras esterlinas se debía á alguno, y no se veían
sino seis cruces para explicar la causa ú origen de la deuda. En algunos
lugares, para mayor seguridad, se añadía el nombre de algún lugar como
"Á la altura de Caracas," ó bien una mera cita geográfica de latitud y
longitud como, 53° 17' 20" y 19° 2' 40".
Aquel memorándum duraba muy cerca del espacio de veinte años,
aumentando, como era natural, el guarismo total, á proporción que el
tiempo avanzaba, hasta que al último se veía un gran total sumado,
después de cuatro ó cinco adiciones equívocas rectificadas, y por todo
apéndice estas tres palabras "Hucha de Bones."
--No le hallo á esto pies ni cabeza, dijo el Doctor.
--Pues la cosa es clara como la luz del medio día, exclamó el Caballero:
este es el libro de cuentas del malvado sabueso. Esas cruces ocupan allí
el lugar de los nombres de buques y aldeas que él echó á pique ó entró á
saqueo. Las sumas no son más que la parte que en cada hazaña de esas
tocó á nuestro escorpión, y en donde tenía algún error ya ve Vd. que
cuidaba de añadir algo que aclarara como "Á la altura de Caracas" ya
puede Vd. colegir por esta inscripción que algún desdichado buque fué
tomado al abordaje á la altura de las costas mencionadas. ¡Dios haya
recibido en su seno á las pobres almas que tripulaban esa barca, tiempo
hace ya!
--Es verdad dijo el Doctor. Vea Vd. de lo que sirve ser uno viajero; es
verdad. Y el monto aumenta á medida que él asciende en categoría.
Muy poco más había en el libro, excepto determinaciones geográficas de
algunos lugares anotados en las hojas en blanco hacia el fin del
cuaderno, y una tabla para la reducción de monedas francesas, inglesas y
españolas á un valor común.
--¡Hombre arreglado! exclamó el Doctor; no era á él á quien podían
hacérsele trampas, de seguro.
--Ahora, prosiguió el Caballero, veamos esto otro.
El papel cuyo exámen seguía, estaba sellado en diversos puntos,
habiéndose usado un dedal por vía de sello, tal vez el mismo que había
yo encontrado en la bolsa del Capitán. El Doctor abrió los sellos con
gran cuidado y apareció entonces el mapa de una isla, con su latitud,
longitud, sondas, nombres de montañas, bahías, caletas, abras, y todos
los pormenores necesarios para poder llevar un buque á anclar á salvo en
sus costas. Parecía como de unas nueve millas de largo y cinco de ancho,
teniendo la figura de una especie de dragón en pie, y presentaba dos
magníficos fondeaderos, perfectamente cerrados y una eminencia en la
parte central marcada con el nombre de "El Vigía." Veíanse algunas
adiciones hechas en fecha más reciente, pero lo que más saltaba á la
vista eran tres cruces marcadas con tinta roja, dos en la parte norte de
la isla y una al sudoeste, y además, escrito con la misma tinta
encarnada en caracteres muy claros y elegantes, bien distintos de la
tosca escritura del Capitán, estas tres significativas palabras "_Aquí
el tesoro_."
Por detrás, la misma mano había trazado estas explicaciones
complementarias.
     --"_Un grande árbol, en la vertiente de 'EL VIGÍA,' en dirección al
     N.-N.N.E._
     "_Islote del Esqueleto E.S.E. cuarta al E._
     "_Diez pies._
     "_La gran barra de plata está en el hoyo del lado Norte; puede
     encontrársela siguiendo el declive del montecillo al Este, diez
     brazas al Sur del peñasco negro frente á él._
     "_Las armas se encontrarán fácilmente en la loma de arena que está
     en la punta Norte del fondeadero septentrional, en dirección Este,
     cuarta al Norte.--J. F._"
Esto era todo; pero conciso como era, y para mí incomprensible, llenó de
júbilo al Caballero y al Doctor Livesey.
--Livesey, dijo el Sr. de Trelawney, va Vd. á abandonar en el acto su
desdichada y penosa profesión. Mañana salgo para Brístol. En tres
semanas... ¡nó! en dos semanas... en diez días, le aseguro á Vd. que
tendremos el mejor buque, si señor, y la más escojida tripulación que
puede suministrar la Inglaterra. Hawkins vendrá con nosotros como paje
de á bordo. ¡Vamos! yo sé que tú harás un famoso paje de á bordo,
chico... Vd., Livesey, será el médico del buque; yo me gradúo Almirante
desde luego. Nos llevaremos á Redruce, Joyce y Hunter. Tendremos vientos
favorables, viaje rápido, y sin la menor dificultad hallaremos el sitio
indicado y en él, dinero en cantidad bastante para comer, para arrastrar
carrozas y para gastar como príncipes por el resto de nuestra vida.
--Trelawney, dijo el Doctor, prometo acompañarle en la expedición, y
puedo responder de su éxito; Jim también vendrá, por supuesto, y será
una honra para la empresa. Pero hay un hombre, uno solo á quien yo temo.
--¿Y quién es él? exclamó el Caballero: nombre Vd. á ese pícaro sin
dilación.
--¡Vd! replicó el Doctor. Vd. que no tiene la fuerza necesaria para
refrenar su lengua. Nosotros no somos los únicos en conocer la
existencia de este documento. Esos individuos que han atacado la posada
esta noche--arrojados y valientes marrulleros sin duda alguna--lo mismo
que los que se habían quedado guardando la extraña barca de que nos
habló Dance, todos esos, y me atreveré á afirmar que otros todavía, por
angas ó por mangas, se créen con la resolución inquebrantable de
apoderarse de la hucha. Ninguno de nosotros, debe, pues, salir solo en
lo de adelante hasta estar á bordo. Jim y yo andaremos juntos en el
interín. Vd. llevará consigo á Joyce y á Hunter cuando salga para
Brístol y del primero al último de los que aquí estamos nos debemos
comprometer á no chistar palabra de lo que hemos descubierto.
--Livesey, dijo el Caballero; Vd. siempre tiene razón: por mi parte
prometo estarme mudo como una tumba.

PARTE II
_EL COCINERO DE "LA ESPAÑOLA"_
CAPÍTULO VII
SALGO PARA BRÍSTOL
Pasó mucho más tiempo del que el Caballero Trelawney se imaginó al
principio, antes de que estuviésemos listos para hacernos á la mar, y
ninguno de nuestros planes primitivos pudo llevarse á ejecución, ni aun
el de que el Doctor Livesey me tuviese siempre consigo. El Doctor tuvo
que marchar á Londres para buscar un médico que se hiciera cargo de su
clientela; el Caballero se fué á Brístol en donde puso, con todo su
ardor, manos á la obra en los preparativos de la expedición, y en cuanto
á mí me quedé instalado en la Universidad, á cargo de Redruth el montero
ó guarda-caza, casi en calidad de prisionero, pero lleno de ensueños
marítimos y de las más atractivas anticipaciones imaginarias de islas
extrañas y aventuras novelescas. Me deleitaba reproduciéndome en un
mapa, durante horas enteras, todos los detalles que recordaba. Y sin
moverme de junto al fuego en el salón del amo de la casa, me acercaba
con la fantasía á la ansiada isla, en todas las direcciones posibles;
exploraba cada acre de terreno de su superficie, subía veinte veces á la
cumbre de aquel elevado monte que llamaban "El Vigía" y desde su cima
gozaba de los más deliciosos y variados panoramas. Algunas veces veía
yo aquella isla densamente cubierta de caníbales con los cuales teníamos
que batirnos; otras veces llena de bravos y salvajes animales que nos
perseguían; pero la verdad es que todas las lucubraciones de mi fantasía
distaron mucho de parecerse á nuestras extrañas y trágicas aventuras en
aquella tierra.
Así fueron discurriendo semanas y semanas hasta que un hermoso día llegó
una carta dirijida al Doctor Livesey, con esta adición "En caso de
ausencia del Doctor, abran esta carta Tom Redruth ó el joven Hawkins."
En acatamiento de esta orden encontramos, pues, ó más bien dicho
encontré yo, puesto que el guarda-monte era un hombre bastante atrasado
en achaques de escritura, y lectura que no fuese en letras de molde,
encontré, digo, las importantes noticias siguientes:
"HOTEL DEL ANCLA, BRÍSTOL, _Marzo 1 de 17--_.
"QUERIDO LIVESEY:
     "No sabiendo si ha regresado Vd. á la Universidad ó si permanece
     todavía en Londres, envío esta por duplicado á ambos lugares.
     "Nuestro buque está ya comprado y arreglado con todo lo necesario.
     Ahora mismo está surto y listo para levar en el primer momento que
     se le necesite. Vd. no ha visto en su vida una goleta más esbelta
     ni más gallarda y velera. Un joven cualquiera podría maniobrarla
     con la mayor facilidad: tiene doscientas toneladas de arquéo y su
     nombre es _La Española_.
     "La he comprado con la intervención de mi viejo amigo Blandy que ha
     probado en esta ocasión ser un sorprendente conocedor de la
     materia. Este incomparable amigo literalmente se ha consagrado en
     cuerpo y alma á mis intereses y--puedo decirlo--lo mismo han hecho
     en Brístol todos, en cuanto que han visto la clase de puerto á que
     nos dirijimos: es decir _á Puerto tesoro_...."
--Redruth, díjele interrumpiendo la lectura de la carta, el Doctor
Livesey no se pondrá muy contento con esto. Veo que, al fin y al cabo,
el Caballero ha dejado que se deslice su lengua.
--Bueno ¿quién tiene más derecho de hacerlo? murmuró el guarda-caza.
Apuesto una botella de rom á que el Caballero puede muy bien hablar sin
esperar el permiso del Dr. Livesey.
Después de esto creí prudente dar de mano á todo comentario y continué
leyendo:
     "Blandy en persona dió con _La Española_, y con una habilidad que
     le admiro, la compró por una verdadera bicoca. Hay aquí en Brístol
     ciertos hombres monstruosamente hostiles al pobre Blandy. Parece
     que andan por esas calles de Dios pregonando que mi honrado y
     excelente amigo no ha hecho más que una grosera especulación; que
     _La Española_ era propiedad suya y que todo lo que hizo fué
     vendérmela á un precio absurdamente alto. Todas esas no son más que
     calumnias evidentes, y lo cierto es que ninguno de sus autores se
     atreve á negar las excelentes cualidades de nuestra goleta.
     "Empero él, dije, no contaba ni con una sola vuelta-de-cabo. Los
     trabajadores, ó por mejor llamarlos, los aparejadores han andado
     verdaderamente á paso de tortuga. Pero esto no era sino obra de
     pocos días. Lo que me preocupaba era la tripulación.
     "Yo quería una veintena redonda de hombres--en caso de ser del
     país, filibusteros; ó bien de los aborrecidos franceses--pero
     parece que lo hacía el diantre mismo, el caso es que yo no daba ni
     con la mitad de lo requerido, hasta que un verdadero golpe de
     fortuna me trajo al hombre que yo necesitaba.
     "Un día estaba yo parado en el muelle cuando, por mera casualidad,
     entré en conversación con él. Me encontré con que es un viejo
     marino que tiene una especie de taberna en Brístol conocida de
     todos los marineros; que ha perdido su salud en tierra y que
     recibiría con mucho agrado una plaza de cocinero á bordo, para
     volver al mar de nueva cuenta. Díjome que aquella mañana andaba por
     allí con objeto de aspirar un poco las brisas salobres del océano.
     "Conmovióme profundamente--como Vd. mismo se hubiera conmovido--y
     aunque no por mera conmiseración, le contraté sobre la marcha, para
     cocinero de nuestra goleta. John Silver es su nombre y tiene una
     pierna menos, lo cual es á mis ojos una recomendación, puesto que
     la ha perdido en defensa de su patria, bajo las órdenes del
     inmortal Hawke. No goza de pensión alguna, Livesey... dígame Vd.
     ¡en qué tiempos tan abominables vivimos!
     "Ahora bien, amigo mío; al principio creí no haber encontrado otra
     cosa que un simple cocinero; pero fué, en realidad, toda una
     tripulación lo que yo descubrí. Entre Silver y yo hemos conseguido,
     en una semana, la más cumplida y característica tripulación que
     pudiera apetecerse; no de aspecto grato ni sonriente á la verdad,
     sino sujetos, á juzgar por sus caras, del más esforzado é indomable
     espíritu. Me atrevo á declarar que podríamos muy bien derrotar á
     una fragata de guerra.
     "Silver ha llevado su escrupulosidad hasta licenciar á unos dos de
     los hombres que yo tenía ya ajustados. Sin gran trabajo me demostró
     en un momento oportuno que los aludidos no eran más que unos
     lampazos de agua dulce que para nada nos servirían, y que antes
     bien nos estorbarían en un caso de apuro.
     "Me siento con la más excelente salud y en admirable disposición de
     ánimo: cómo como un toro, duermo como un tronco y sin embargo no me
     daré punto de tregua ni de reposo hasta que no oiga y vea á mis
     viejos lobos marinos maniobrar en torno del cabrestante. ¡Á la mar!
     ¡pronto á la mar! ¡Á sacar ese tesoro! La locura de las glorias
     marítimas se ha apoderado de mi cabeza. Así, pues, Livesey, véngase
     volando: si en algo me estima Vd. no pierda ni un minuto.
     "Deje Vd. al jovencillo Hawkins que vaya, sin tardanza, á visitar á
     su madre, al cargo de mi viejo Redruth, y que ambos se vengan
     luego, á toda prisa, para Brístol.
JUAN TRELAWNEY.
     "_Postscriptum._--Se me olvidaba decirle que Blandy, á quien dejo
     con el encargo de enviar una embarcación en busca nuestra si no
     hemos regresado para fines de Agosto, ha encontrado un sujeto
     admirable para Capitán de nuestra goleta, un hombre muy serio y muy
     estirado--lo cual deploro, de paso--pero en todos los demás
     conceptos un verdadero tesoro. Silver, por su lado, nos ha traído
     un hombre muy competente para piloto: su nombre es Arrow. Tengo un
     contramaestre que silba para la maniobra que es una gloria, así es
     que las cosas van á marchar, á bordo de _La Española_, como si
     hubiéramos fletado un verdadero buque de guerra.
     "Se me pasaba añadir que Silver es un hombre de sustancia: me
     consta personalmente que tiene su cuenta en el banco y que sus
     gastos nunca han excedido á sus depósitos. Deja á cargo de su
     establecimiento á su esposa y como ésta es una mulata, podemos
     decirnos aquí, entre solteros como ambos somos, que me parece que
     no sólo es la salud sino la mujer lo que hace que Silver quiera
     salir otra vez á correr los mares.
J. T.
     "_P. P. S._--Hawkins puede quedarse una noche con su madre.
J. T."
Cualquiera se figurará, sin esfuerzo, la emoción que esa carta me
produjo. Estaba medio fuera de mí de júbilo. Pero si hubo alguna vez
hombre despechado sobre la tierra ese era ciertamente el pobre viejo Tom
Redruth que no hacía ni podía hacer más que gruñir y lamentarse.
Cualquiera de los guarda-montes subordinados suyos, se habría cambiado
por él con el mayor placer, pero no eran esos los deseos del Caballero,
y tales deseos eran como leyes entre aquellas buenas gentes. Nadie que
no fuese el viejo Redruth se habría tomado la libertad de murmurar
siquiera como á él le era permitido hacerlo.
Á la mañana siguiente él y yo nos pusimos en marcha, á pie, hacia la
posada del "_Almirante Benbow_," en la cual encontré á mi madre muy bien
de cuerpo y de alma. El Capitán aquel, que por tan largo tiempo había
sido para nosotros causa de tanto disgusto, había ido ya al lugar en
que los perversos cesan de molestar. El Caballero había hecho reparar
todos los estragos á sus expensas, y tanto los salones de la parte
pública de la casa como la enseña de la posada, habían sido pintados de
nuevo, habiéndose añadido algunos muebles de que antes carecíamos, entre
ellos, principalmente, una muy cómoda silla de brazos para mi madre tras
del mostrador. Al mismo tiempo le había buscado un muchachuelo, como de
mi edad, en calidad de aprendiz, con el cual mi madre no necesitaba de
más servidumbre durante mi ausencia.
Al ver á este rapaz fué cuando comprendí por completo mi verdadera
situación. Hasta aquel momento me había fijado tan sólo en las aventuras
que me esperaban, pero no en el hogar que dejaba tras de mí. Así fué
que, allí, en la presencia de aquel palurdo extraño, que iba á quedarse
en mi lugar, al lado de mi madre, tuve irremediablemente mi primer
ataque de lágrimas. Me sospecho que aquel día hice rabiar más de lo
conveniente á aquel pobre chico que, siendo nuevo en el oficio, me
ofreció mil oportunidades que yo aproveché para corregirle lo que hacía
y para humillarlo cuanto pude.
Pasó la noche, y al día siguiente, después de la comida, Redruth y yo
salimos, de nuevo á pie, por el camino real. Dije adiós muy conmovido á
mi madre, á la caleta en que había vivido desde que nací, á aquel viejo
y querido "_Almirante Benbow_" que, sin embargo, me parecía menos
querido desde el instante en que ya lo había tocado la mano profana del
pintor. Una de las últimas cosas en que pensé fué en el Capitán que tan
frecuentemente salía á vagar á lo largo de la playa con su sombrero
volándole sobre la espalda, con su gran cuchilla colgada bajo la blusa
y su enorme anteojo de larga vista bajo el brazo. Un instante después,
ya habíamos volteado tras el ángulo de las rocas, y mi hogar y sus
contornos habían desaparecido.
La tartana del correo nos recogió, al oscurecer, en el _Royal George_
hacia el brezal. Se me incrustó en el coche aquel entre un viejo gordo y
mi amigo Redruth, y á pesar del desapacible movimiento y del aire frío
de la noche, debo haber cabeceado bonitamente desde un principio, y en
seguida entregándome á un sueño de lirón, lo mismo de subida que de
bajada, y estación tras de estación, porque cuando concluí por
despertar, lo hice gracias á una insinuación poco amable que sentí por
el costado. Abrí entonces los ojos y me encontré con que nos acabábamos
de detener frente á un grande edificio en la calle de una ciudad y que
era ya perfectamente de día, desde hacía mucho tiempo.
--¿En dónde estamos?, pregunté.
--En Brístol, dijo Tom, bájate ya.
El Sr. Trelawney había sentado sus reales en una posada cerca de los
muelles, para vigilar por sí mismo los trabajos en la goleta. Para ella
teníamos que enderezar nuestro rumbo inmediatamente y, con gran
contentamiento mío, nuestro camino iba á lo largo de todos los muelles
y, por consiguiente, al lado de una verdadera multitud de barcos de
todos tamaños, de todas nacionalidades y de todos los aparejos
imaginables.
En uno, los marineros cantaban alegremente mientras trabajaban: en otro
se veían hombres suspensos allá muy arriba, sobre mi cabeza, asidos
solamente de cuerdas que no parecían más gruesas que las hebras de una
telaraña. Aunque toda mi vida la había yo pasado en la playa, me
parecía que hasta entonces era cuando conocía el mar verdaderamente. El
olor penetrante del alquitrán y la sal eran para mí una novedad. Veía
las más extrañas y maravillosas cabezas que jamás han cruzado sobre el
océano. Veía, además, muchos viejos marinos con arracadas en las orejas
y con sus patillas rizadas en bucles; y los más ostentando sus embreadas
coletas sobre la espalda, y marchando todos ellos con ese paso cimbrador
propio de los marineros. Puede creérseme que si hubiera visto otros
tantos reyes ó arzobispos juntos no me hubiera deleitado más de lo que
lo estaba en aquellos momentos.
¡Y yo... yo mismo iba también á hacerme á la mar; iba á penetrar á una
goleta con su contramaestre mandando la maniobra con su silbato, con sus
marinos de trenza, cantando al compás de las ondas; y todos navegando en
pos de una isla desconocida, en busca de tesoros enterrados!
Todavía iba yo gozando con este ensueño delicioso cuando de repente nos
detuvimos frente á una gran posada y nos encontramos con el caballero
Trelawney, ya muy vestido y aderezado como un oficial de á bordo, con un
traje de grueso paño azul, saliendo, á la sazón, á la puerta de la
posada, con una expresión sonriente en todo su semblante, y con una
perfecta imitación del andar contoneado de un marinero.
--¡Vamos! ya están aquí Vds., dijo. El Doctor ha llegado anoche de
Londres. ¡Bravísimo! ¡La compañía de nuestro buque está completa!
--¡Oh! señor, exclamé yo, ¿y cuándo zarpamos?
--¿Zarpar?, me contestó, ¡mañana sin falta!

CAPÍTULO VIII
LA TABERNA DE "EL VIGÍA."
En cuanto que hube almorzado, el Caballero me dió una carta dirigida á
John Silver, á su taberna de "El Vigía" y me dijo que me sería muy fácil
encontrarla, siguiendo la línea de los muelles y estando alerta para
cuando viese una pequeña taberna con un anteojo marino de larga vista,
por enseña. Lancéme afuera sin dilación todo alborozado con esta nueva
oportunidad que se me presentaba de observar más atentamente y más de
cerca todos aquellos buques y marineros, y tomé mi derrotero, en
consecuencia, por enmedio de una verdadera masa de gentes, carromatos y
bultos de mercancías, por ser aquella la hora de mayor quehacer y
tráfico en los muelles, hasta que dí, al fin, con la taberna en
cuestión.
Era ella, á la verdad, un sitio de solaz bastante aceptable. La enseña
estaba recién pintada; las ventanas tenían flamantes cortinas rojas y
los pisos aparecían cuidadosamente enarenados. El establecimiento hacía
esquina, teniendo una puerta para cada calle, abierta de par en par, lo
que hacía que el salón bajo tuviese bastante aire y luz, á despecho de
las nubes de humo de tabaco que salían de las bocas de los parroquianos.
Eran estos, en su mayor parte, de la marinería del puerto y hablaban en
voz tan alta que, al llegar, no pude menos que detenerme á la puerta,
vacilante y casi atemorizado de entrar.
Estaba yo en espera del patrón, cuando un hombre salió de un cuarto de
al lado del salón, y á la primera ojeada tuve la seguridad de que aquel
no era otro que John Silver. Su pierna izquierda había sido amputada
desde la cadera, y bajo el brazo izquierdo se apoyaba en una muleta que
manejaba con la más increíble destreza, saltando sobre ella con la
agilidad de un pájaro. Era muy alto y fuerte, con una cara tan grande
como un jamón, rasurada y pálida, pero inteligente y risueña. No cabía
duda en que estaba, á la sazón, del mejor humor del mundo, silbando
alegremente mientras pasaba por entre las mesas, y soltando, á cada
paso, una broma graciosa ó dando una palmadilla familiar sobre el hombro
á cada uno de sus parroquianos favoritos.
Ahora bien, si he de decir la verdad, confesaré que, desde la primera
mención que el Caballero hacía en su carta, de John Silver, comencé á
temer interiormente que este no fuese otro que el "marinero de una sola
pierna" por cuya temida aparición vigilé tanto tiempo en el "_Almirante
Benbow_." Pero me bastó la primera ojeada que eché sobre él para
desvanecer mis temores. Yo había visto bien al Capitán, y á Black Dog, y
al ciego Pew y creí que ya con eso me bastaba para saber lo que era ó
debía ser un filibustero, es decir una criatura, según yo, bien distinta
de aquel aseado, sonriente y bien humorado amo de casa.
Todo mi valor me vino inmediatamente; pasé el vestíbulo y me dirijí sin
rodeos al hombre aquel, en el lugar mismo en que estaba en aquel
momento, recargado en su muleta y conversando con un parroquiano.
--¿El Sr. Silver?, pregunté tendiéndole la carta.
--Yo soy, chiquillo; ese es mi nombre á lo que parece. ¿Y tú quién eres?
Y luego como viese la escritura del Caballero en el sobre de la carta,
me pareció como que contenía mal un sobresalto involuntario.
--¡Oh!, díjome en voz muy alta y ofreciéndome su mano, ahora comprendo,
tú eres el pajecillo de cámara de la goleta, ¿no es verdad? Mucho gusto
tengo de verte.
Y diciendo esto tomó la mía en su larga y poderosa mano.
Precisamente en aquel momento uno de los parroquianos que estaban en el
lado más retirado, se levantó repentinamente y se precipitó fuera de la
puerta que tenía muy cerca de sí, lo cual le permitió ganar la calle en
un instante. Pero su precipitación me hizo fijarme en él y le reconocí á
la primera ojeada. Era aquel mismo hombre de cara enjuta, á quien
faltaban dos dedos en una mano y que fué una vez al "_Almirante
Benbow_."
--¡Oh! grité yo, ¡deténganlo! ¡ese es Black Dog!
--No me importa mucho quien pueda ser, exclamó Silver, pero no ha pagado
su cuenta. ¡Harry, corre y atrápalo!
Uno de los otros que estaban cerca de la puerta se puso en pie de un
salto y se precipitó afuera en persecución del fugitivo.
--¡Oh! yo le haré que pague su consumo, así fuera el mismo Almirante
Hawke en cuerpo y alma.
En seguida añadió soltándome la mano:
--¿Quién dices tú que es ese?... _Black_... ¿qué?
--Black Dog, señor, le contesté. ¿No le ha contado á Vd. el Sr.
Trelawney lo de los filibusteros? Pues este era uno de ellos.
--¡Es posible!, exclamó Silver. ¡Y semejante hombre en mi casa! Mira tú,
Ben, corre y ayuda á Harry á perseguir á ese. ¿Con que él era uno de
esos pillastres, eh? Hola, tú, Morgan, vén aquí, ¿estabas tú bebiendo
con ese hombre?
El interpelado que era un viejo bastante cano y con cara color de caoba,
se acercó con un continente bastante marino, contoneándose á babor y á
estribor.
--Veamos, dijo John Silver, con bastante rigidez, ¿no has visto tú antes
de ahora á ese Black... Black Dog? ¡Dí pronto!
--Yo no, señor, contestó Morgan con una reverencia.
--¿Tú no sabías cómo se llamaba, eh?
--No señor.
--¡Rayos y truenos! Tom Morgan; dále gracias á Dios por ello, exclamó el
irritado tabernero, porque si yo averiguo que te andas mezclando con
canallas de esa ralea, te prometo, por quien soy, que no vuelves á poner
un pie en mi casa, entiéndelo bien. ¿Y que te estaba platicando?
--La verdad no lo sé, no puse cuidado.
--¡Es creíble! y luego dirán Vds. que tienen la cabeza sobre los
hombros! ¿no es éste un bendito que nada ve? ¿Con que no lo sabes? ¿con
que no pusiste cuidado? tal vez ni supiste con quién estabas hablando,
¿no es verdad? ni qué es lo que decía, eh? Vamos, haz por acordarte,
¿qué es lo que charlaba, ¿viajes? ¿capitanes? ¿buques?... vamos, ¿qué
era?
--Yo creo que estábamos hablando de estirar la quilla.
--Con que de estirarla, ¿eh? ¡Grande asunto por cierto! Es muy posible,
sí...! ¡Anda, vuélvete á tu lugar, haragán!
Mientras Morgan se volvía á su asiento, Silver murmuró casi á mi oído,
en un tono muy confidencial, que me pareció en extremo halagador para
mí:
--Ese pobre Tom Morgan es todo un hombre honrado; solamente tiene la
desdicha de ser estúpido.
Y luego levantando la voz de nuevo, prosiguió.
--Con que veamos,... ¿Black Dog?... pues no, no conozco ese nombre, no
por cierto. Sin embargo, tengo cierta idea... sí, yo creo haber visto ya
antes á ese _agua-dulce_ por aquí. Entiendo que solía venir antes en
compañía de un mendigo ciego.
--Por supuesto, le dije yo con seguridad; puede Vd. creerlo. Yo conocí
también á ese ciego. Se llamaba Pew.
--¡Es verdad! exclamó Silver, en extremo excitado ya, ¡Pew! ese era su
nombre, á no caber duda. ¡Ah! parecía un tiburón completo, de veras que
sí! Así, si ahora cogemos á este Black Dog, ya tendremos noticias que
enviar á nuestro buen Patrón el Caballero Trelawney. Ben es un buen
galgo; creo que pocos marineros tendrán piernas más ligeras que él.
¡Rayos y truenos! yo creo que debería acogotarlo y traérnoslo aquí bien
agarrotado. ¿Con que estaba hablando de estirar la quilla, eh? ¡No le
daré yo mal tirón de quilla al belitre si me lo traen!
Todo el tiempo que gastó en disparar esa andanaba de amenazas, no cesó
de recorrer el salón de un lado al otro, brincando agitadamente sobre
su muleta, golpeando con la mano sobre las mesas y manifestando una
excitación tal que hubiera bastado para convencer al juez más ducho y
para hacer caer en el garlito al más avisado. Mis sospechas se habían de
nuevo despertado con gran fuerza al encontrarme con el Black Dog en la
taberna misma de "El Vigía," por lo cual me propuse tener la mirada
atenta sobre el cocinero de _La Española_ y espiar sus menores
movimientos. Pero aquel hombre era demasiado vivo, y demasiado zorro, y
sobradamente astuto para mí; y así es que pronto me distraje con la
vuelta de los dos sabuesos soltados en persecución de Black Dog, los
cuales llegaban sin aliento confesando que habían perdido el rastro de
su presa en una apretura de gentes y que se habían visto regañados como
si fueran ladrones. En aquellos momentos habría yo puesto mi cabeza
fiando la inocencia de John Silver.
--Mira tú no más, ahora, Hawkins, dijo este, aquí tienes, un compromiso
para un hombre como yo. ¿Qué va á pensar de mí el Caballero Trelawney?
¡Tener yo, aquí, en mi misma casa, á ese hijo de un demonio, bebiendo mi
propio rom! No más, ven y díme si no es diablura; y aquí mismo, á mis
propios ojos le dejamos todos que tome las de Villadiego! ¡Rayos y
truenos! Yo creo, muchachito, que tú me harás justicia con el Capitán.
Tú eres un chicuelo todavía, pero vivo como un zancudo. Yo te lo conocí
en cuanto que te puse el ojo encima. La cosa es esta: ¿qué puedo yo
hacer con esta vieja muleta que es mi apoyo? Cuando yo comenzaba apenas
mi carrera de marinero, ya habría sabido yo traerme á ese _agua dulce_
por delante, mano sobre mano, y doblegarlo en una lucha, cuerpo á
cuerpo. Sí, entonces lo habría hecho, pero ahora, ¡rayos y truenos...!
En aquel punto cesó de hablar repentinamente, se quedó con la quijada
inmóvil y suspensa como si se hubiera acordado de algo.
--¡La cuenta!, prorrumpió al fin; ¡tres pases de rom! ¡mil carronadas!
¡pues no había yo olvidado ya la cuenta!
Y dejándose caer en un banco, al decir esto, prorrumpió en una risotada
tan sostenida que las lágrimas concluyeron por rodar sobre su rostro. No
pude impedirme el imitarle, así fué que reímos juntos, una carcajada
tras de otra hasta que la taberna resonó con los ecos de nuestras
risotadas.
--¡Vamos! ¡pues bonita foca soy yo!, dijo al fin, enjugándose las
mejillas; tú y yo haremos buenas migas, Hawkins, pues á permitírmelo el
diablo cree tú que yo no sería más que pajecillo de á bordo, como tú.
Pero ahora, ¡que le vamos á hacer! ya no es tiempo para pensar patrañas.
El deber es lo primero, camarada, así es que voy á ponerme en seguida mi
viejo sombrero montado y marchar sin pérdida de tiempo contigo á ver al
Caballero Trelawney y á contarle lo que aquí ha pasado. Porque,
acuérdate de lo que te digo, Hawkins, esto es serio, tan serio que ni tú
ni yo saldremos de ello con lo que pomposamente llamaré crédito. Ni tú
tampoco, dije... ¡vaya con el tonto! Los dos estamos ahora tontos de
capirote. Pero ¡voto á San Jorge, aquel sí que supo hacerla con mi
cuenta!
Y diciendo esto, comenzó á reir de nuevo con todas sus ganas y con tal
fuerza comunicativa que, por más que yo no encontraba ni sentido, ni
maldita sea la gracia á lo que acababa de decir, me ví arrastrado de
nuevo á acompañarle en su estrepitosa carcajada.
En nuestra pequeña excursión á lo largo de los muelles se manifestó
conmigo el más servicial é interesante compañero, explicándome cerca de
cada uno de los principales buques junto á los cuales pasábamos todo lo
relativo á su aparejo, capacidad, nación, obras que en ellos se
ejecutaban, si el uno estaba á la carga y el otro á la descarga, si el
de más allá estaba listo para zarpar y á cada paso entreverando
divertidas anécdotas, de navíos y navegantes, ó repitiéndome las frases
del tecnicismo de á bordo hasta que yo las aprendía perfectamente.
Entonces comencé á creer que aquel hombre era positivamente uno de los
mejores marinos posibles.
Cuando llegamos á la posada el Caballero y el Doctor Livesey estaban
sentados juntos concluyendo alegremente de apurar una botella de cerveza
con su brindis correspondiente, antes de que se pusieran en marcha para
ir á hacer á _La Española_ una visita de inspección.
John Silver les refirió lo que acababa de suceder, del _pe_ al _pa_, con
una verba llena de animación y conservando la más perfecta verdad en su
relato.
--Eso fué lo que sucedió, ¿no es verdad Hawkins? se interrumpía de vez
en cuando, á cuya interpelación, por supuesto, tenía yo que contestar
afirmativamente.
Los dos caballeros deploraron mucho que Black Dog se hubiese escapado,
pero todos tuvimos que convenir en que nada podía hacerse, por lo cual,
después de haber recibido cordiales cumplimientos, John Silver tomó su
muleta de nuevo y se marchó á su taberna.
--Todo el mundo á bordo, esta tarde á las cuatro, le gritó el Caballero,
cuando ya él iba alejándose.
--¡Bravo, bravo, bravo! clamó el cocinero con entusiasmo y siguiendo su
camino.
--Oigame Vd., Sr. Trelawney, dijo el Doctor, por regla general yo no
tengo una gran fe en los descubrimientos de Vd., mas por lo que hace á
este John Silver debo confesarle que me satisface por completo.
--Un hombre como él es "triunfo" en mano, declaró el Caballero.
--Y ahora, añadió el Doctor, opino que Jim debe venir con nosotros á
bordo, ¿no le parece á Vd.?
--Estoy de acuerdo, replicó el Sr. Trelawney. Toma tu sombrero, Hawkins,
y vamos á ver ese famoso buque.

CAPÍTULO IX
PÓLVORA Y ARMAS
_La Española_ estaba á una distancia considerable y nosotros hicimos
nuestro camino entre las elaboradas y elegantes proas de unos buques y
las popas de otros, cuyo cordaje y vergas, unas veces se liaban y yacían
bajo nuestros pies, otras se balanceaban galanamente sobre nuestras
cabezas. Por último llegamos á nuestro barco en el cual nos recibió, en
cuanto saltamos á bordo, el piloto, Sr. Arrow, un viejo marino de faz
morena con arracadas en sus orejas y que, por desdicha, tenía los ojos
torcidos. El Caballero y él parecían congeniar bastante y llevarse en
muy buenos términos, pero no tardé en observar que no acontecía lo mismo
tratándose de las relaciones del mismo Sr. de Trelawney con el Capitán
de _La Española_.
Este último era un hombre de aspecto severo que parecía disgustado con
todo, á bordo de nuestra goleta, y pronto iba á decirnos por qué, pues
no bien habíamos entrado al salón principal, cuando un marinero vino
tras de nosotros y dijo:
--Caballero: el Capitán Smollet desea hablar con Vd.
--Siempre estoy á las órdenes del Capitán, contestó el Caballero. Hágale
Vd. pasar adelante.
El Capitán que estaba muy cerca de su mensajero entró en el acto y cerró
la puerta tras de sí.
--Ahora bien, Capitán Smollet, ¿qué es lo que Vd. tiene que decirnos?
Supongo que todo aquí marcha y está arreglado como entre buenos
navegantes y verdadera gente de mar.
--Vea Vd., señor, contestó el Capitán, creo que hablar sin rodeos es
siempre lo más práctico, aun á riesgo de parecer que se ofende. Hé aquí
mi opinión: no me gusta este viaje, no me gusta la tripulación y no me
gusta mi segundo á bordo: esto es hablar claro y en plata.
--Tal vez, señor mío, ¿tampoco le gusta á Vd. el buque?, añadió el
Caballero, bastante molesto, á lo que me pareció.
--En cuanto á eso nada puedo decir, puesto que no lo he visto moverse
aún. Á la simple vista me parece un velero muy hermoso: más no puedo
decir.
--Es también muy posible que le disguste á Vd. el Patrón, recalcó el
Caballero.
En este punto el Doctor Livesey creyó oportuno intervenir diciendo:
--Un momento, señores, un momento, si Vds. gustan. Esas preguntas no
conducen á nada más que á creer una mala voluntad perjudicial. Yo creo
que el Capitán, ó ha dicho demasiado ó ha dicho muy poco, y me creo en
el deber de requerirle para que nos explique sus palabras. Ha dicho Vd.
para comenzar, que no le gusta este viaje. Veamos... ¿por qué?
--Se me ha contratado, señor, por el sistema de lo que llamamos nosotros
"pliego cerrado." Se me ha requerido simplemente para gobernar un navío,
llevándolo al punto y rumbo que me designase el contratante. Hasta allí
todo estaba bueno. Pero ahora me encuentro con que todos y cada uno de
los hombres de la tripulación, saben mucho más que yo acerca de nuestro
viaje. Yo no puedo calificar esto de recto ni de natural; ¿tengo razón?
--Sí, sí la tiene Vd., dijo el Doctor.
--En seguida he sabido, por mis propios marinos, que vamos en busca de
un tesoro--no olvide Vd. que son ellos los que me lo hacen saber. Ahora
bien, eso de tesoro es cosa que tiene sus peligros. Á mí no me gustan
viajes de tesoros por ningún motivo, más cuando son secretos, y sobre
todo--perdóneme el Sr. Trelawney--cuando el tal secreto ha sido confiado
al loro.
--¿Al loro de Silver?, preguntó el Caballero.
--He hablado en sentido figurado. Quiero decir que ha sido divulgado. Yo
tengo la creencia de que ninguno de Vds., caballeros, sabe bien en lo
que se ha metido. Les diré, pues, mí opinión lisa y llana: este es
asunto de vida ó muerte y un albur positivamente delicado.
--Así lo veo yo, dijo el Doctor, y me parece que es tan claro como
cierto. Estamos á las contingencias, aunque no nos encontramos tan en
tinieblas como Vd. lo supone. Pero añadió Vd. también que no le gusta la
tripulación, ¿cree Vd. que los nuestros no son verdaderos marinos?
--No me agradan, señor, insistió el Capitán Smollet. Me parece que se me
debió haber dejado elegir mis hombres, yendo á una expedición como la
que vamos.
--Quizás tenga Vd. razón, replicó el Doctor. Tal vez hubiera sido mejor
que mi amigo hubiera hecho su elección de acuerdo con Vd. Pero puede
creer que la falta, si la hubo, fué enteramente involuntaria. Por
último, dijo Vd. que tampoco le gusta su segundo el Sr. Arrow.
--Así es, señor. Yo creo que es un buen marino, pero se roza demasiado
familiarmente con la tripulación para ser un buen oficial. Un piloto
debe siempre darse á respetar, y no permitirse brindar, como éste, en
compañía íntima, con los marineros.
--¿Quiere Vd. decir que el hombre bebe?, exclamó el Caballero.
--No señor; solamente que mantiene una intimidad sobrado inconveniente
con los hombres de la tripulación.
--Está bien, pues, Capitán, dijo el Doctor; pero si hemos de zanjar
dificultades, díganos Vd. lo que desea.
--Bien, señores; ¿están Vds. determinados á llevar á cabo esta
expedición?
--Contra viento y marea, respondió el Caballero.
--Muy bien, dijo el Capitán. Pero supuesto que ya han tenido Vds. la
paciencia de oirme cosas que no me era dable probar, escuchen algunas
palabras más. Se está colocando la pólvora y las armas en las bodegas de
proa: ¿por qué no ponerlas en un lugar muy á propósito que hay aquí,
precisamente debajo del salón? Primer punto. Ahora, segundo: Vds. traen
cuatro personas de su propia servidumbre que, según he oído, van á tener
sus dormitorios á proa, con los demás hombres ¿por qué no darles los
camarotes que hay aquí al lado de la cámara de popa?
--¿Hay algo más?, preguntó el Sr. Trelawney.
--Sí, hay todavía otra exigencia, continuó el Capitán. Por desgracia ya
se ha charlado y divulgado mucho sobre la expedición.
--Sí, demasiado, apoyó el Doctor.
--Diré á Vds. lo que yo mismo he oído, siguió el Capitán: dicen que Vds.
poseen un mapa de cierta isla en el cual hay cruces rojas que marcan el
lugar exacto en que esas riquezas están enterradas; añaden que la isla
está... (y aquí nombró la longitud y latitud de ella con toda
exactitud).
--Jamás he dicho yo tal cosa, exclamó el Caballero.
--El hecho es que los hombres lo saben, replicó el Capitán.
--Livesey, tal vez alguna indiscreción de Vd.; ó tal vez tú, Hawkins,
exclamó el Sr. Trelawney.
--No hace mucho al caso el averiguar quién haya sido el indiscreto,
replicó el Doctor.
Por mi parte, me fué fácil notar que ni él ni el Capitán daban mucho
peso á las afirmaciones y protestas del Sr. Trelawney, sin que yo mismo
dejara de pensar como ellos, pues me constaba que el Caballero era un
charlador incorregible. Sin embargo, en esta ocasión, decía la pura
verdad, según creo, y era un hecho que ninguno había revelado la
posición geográfica de la isla.
--En hora buena, caballeros, continuó el Capitán; yo no sé en manos de
quién está ese mapa, pero pongo por condición estricta que se le
mantenga de todo punto secreto y oculto aun de mí mismo y de mi segundo
el Sr. Arrow, ó de no ser así, renuncio mi puesto en este mismo
instante.
--Entiendo, dijo el Doctor; lo que Vd. quiere es que el objeto real se
mantenga tan velado como sea posible y que, entre tanto, convirtamos la
popa en una especie de fortificación, guardada por nuestros propios
hombres y provista con toda la pólvora y armas de que podamos disponer á
bordo. En otras palabras, teme Vd. una rebelión.
--Caballero, dijo gravemente el Capitán Smollet, protestando que no es
mi intención el lastimar á Vd., permítame negarle el derecho de poner en
mis labios palabras que yo no he pronunciado. No existe capitán alguno
que pudiera juzgarse autorizado para hacerse á la mar, si tuviese las
pruebas necesarias para decir lo que Vd. me ha supuesto. Por lo que hace
al Piloto, lo creo de todo punto honrado; algunos de nuestros
tripulantes lo son también sin duda, y quizás lo sean todos, por lo que
se ve. Pero Vds. se servirán tener en cuenta que sobre mí pesa la doble
responsabilidad de la seguridad de la embarcación y de la vida de cada
hombre que nuestra goleta lleva á bordo. Me ha parecido que las cosas no
iban por un camino muy derecho y he juzgado prudente el pedir á Vds. que
se tomaran ciertas precauciones: eso es cuanto tengo que decir.
--Capitán Smollet, comenzó á decir el Doctor con cierta sonrisa en los
labios, ¿ha oído Vd. hablar alguna vez de cierta fábula de la montaña y
el ratón? Le pido á Vd. mil perdones, pero la verdad es que me ha traído
Vd. á la memoria la tal fábula. Cuando Vd. penetró aquí, apuesto mi
peluca á que Vd. pensaba más de lo que confiesa.
--Doctor, es Vd. muy listo, respondió el Capitán; cuando entré aquí
pensé que se me iba á separar del buque. No me imaginé que el Sr. de
Trelawney hubiese oído una sola palabra de cuanto he dicho.
--Y no iba Vd. muy descaminado, exclamó el Caballero. Á no ser por la
oportuna mediación de Livesey yo le hubiera enviado á Vd. al diantre.
Pero por ahora ya le he escuchado y se hará todo lo que Vd. quiere; mas
eso no me impide el creer que está Vd. equivocado en este asunto.
--En cuanto á eso crea Vd. lo que guste, dijo el Capitán. Vd. verá en
todo caso, que cumplo con mi deber.
Dicho esto saludó y salió sin decir más.
--Trelawney, dijo el Doctor, contra todo lo que yo me figuraba, veo que
Vd. se ha dado trazas de traer á bordo dos hombres honrados: el Capitán
Smollet y John Silver.
--Silver, si Vd. lo quiere, gritó el Caballero. En cuanto á este
intolerable trampantojo, declaro que su conducta no me parece digna ni
de hombre, ni de marino, ni mucho menos de inglés.
--Está bien, dijo el Doctor, ya lo veremos.
Cuando subimos sobre cubierta ya los hombres habían comenzado á cambiar
de lugar las armas y la pólvora, canturriando mientras trabajaban, en
tanto que el Capitán y el Piloto inspeccionaban el traslado.
El nuevo orden de cosas era de todo mi gusto. Todo el arreglo primitivo
del buque había sido cambiado. Se habían hecho seis lechos-literas en el
castillo de popa, tras de lo que constituía la parte posterior del salón
principal, siendo accesible esta sección de camarotes, para la galera y
castillo de proa, únicamente por un estrecho pasadizo á babor. Se había
dispuesto, al principio, que el Capitán, el Piloto, Hunter, Joyce, el
Doctor y el Caballero ocupasen esos seis camarotes. Ahora se convino en
que Redruth y yo tomásemos dos de ellos y que el Sr. Arrow y el Capitán
durmiesen sobre cubierta en lo que se llama en náutica _la carroza_, la
cual había sido ensanchada de un lado y otro hasta ponerla en estado de
casi poder llamarle _la toldilla_. Era ésta bien baja, ciertamente, pero
no tanto que no permitiese colgar con comodidad un par de hamacas, y aun
creo que el Piloto pareció muy contento con el arreglo, aunque él,
quizás, no estaba muy seguro de la tripulación. Empero esto no pasa de
simple conjetura, pues como se verá muy pronto, no tuvimos por largo
tiempo el beneficio de sus opiniones.
Estábamos todos trabajando rudamente en el cambio de la pólvora y armas
y en el arreglo de las literas y camarotes cuando los últimos dos
tripulantes y John Silver con ellos llegaron en un botecito costanero.
El cocinero saltó á bordo con la ligereza de un mono y no bien hubo
visto lo que estábamos haciendo, exclamó:
--Hola muchachos, ¿de qué se trata?
--Cambiando las municiones y las armas, ya lo ve Vd., respondió un
marinero.
-¿Por qué, con mil diablos?, prorrumpió Silver. ¡Si nos entretenemos en
eso vamos á perder la marea de la mañana!
--Yo lo he mandado, dijo el Capitán secamente. Vd., amigo, bájese á su
cocina que las gentes deben sentir ganas de cenar antes de mucho.
--Corriendo, corriendo, contestó el cocinero y tocándose, por vía de
reverencia, la melena; y desapareció en el acto en dirección de su
galera.
--Ese es un buen hombre, Capitán, dijo el Doctor.
--Es muy posible, Caballero, replicó el Capitán, en paz con ese, en paz
con todos. Dió prisa, en seguida, á los que estaban cambiando la
pólvora, y de repente, fijándose en mí, que estaba muy entretenido
examinando el eslabón de vuelta que traíamos en medio del navío, me
gritó con aspereza:
--¡Hola tú, grumete, largo de ahí! Márchate á la cocina y busca algo que
hacer.
Y aunque me dí prisa á obedecer su mandato, le oí todavía decir, en voz
bien alta, al Doctor:
--Yo no traigo favoritos en mi navío.
Puedo asegurar á Vds. que en aquellos momentos superabundaba yo en las
opiniones y sentimientos del Sr. Trelawney respecto del Capitán, á quien
aborrecía con todas mis fuerzas.

Toda aquella noche la pasamos en gran movimiento alistándolo todo,
poniendo cada cosa en su lugar y viendo llegar, uno tras de otro, botes
llenos de amigos del Caballero, como el Sr. Blandy y otros por el estilo
que iban á desearle un buen viaje y feliz regreso. Nunca en nuestro
"_Almirante Benbow_" tuve una noche semejante, ni siquiera la mitad del
quehacer que tuve en ésta, y puede creérseme que estaba ya rendido de
cansancio cuando un poco antes del alba, el contramaestre hizo sonar su
silbato y la tripulación toda comenzó á maniobrar al cabrestante. Pero
aunque hubiera sido doble de la que era mi fatiga no me hubiera separado
de sobre cubierta. Todo aquello era nuevo é interesante para mí, las
concisas órdenes, la penetrante nota del silbato y los marineros
moviéndose hacia sus lugares al ténue resplandor de las linternas del
navío.
--Y ahora, Barbacoa, suéltanos una estrofa, gritó una voz.
--La conocida, añadió otra.
--Vaya por la vieja conocida, camaradas, dijo Silver que estaba allí de
pie, con su muleta bajo el brazo; y al punto prorrumpió en aquella
horrible cantinela que me era tan conocida:
    "_Son quince los que quieren el cofre de aquel muerto._"
Á lo cual la tripulación entera contestaba en coro:
    _Son quince ¡yo--ho--hó! son quince ¡viva el rom!_"
Y á la tercera repetición del coro, empujó las barras del cabrestante al
frente de ellos con gran brío.
Mas aun en aquel momento de excitación, ese canto lúgubre me trasladaba
con la imaginación en un segundo, á mi vieja posada del "_Almirante
Benbow_" en la cual oía de nuevo la voz de aquel Capitán sobresaliendo
sobre el coro entero. Pero muy pronto el ancla estaba ya fuera y se la
dejaba colgar, escurriendo junto á la proa. Pronto se izaron también las
velas que comenzaron á hincharse suavemente con la brisa, y las costas y
los buques empezaron á desfilar ante mis ojos de uno y otro lado, de tal
manera que, antes de que hubiera ido á buscar en el sueño una hora de
descanso, ya _La Española_ había zarpado gentilmente, empezando su viaje
hacía la Isla del Tesoro.
No es mi ánimo referir todos y cada uno de los detalles de ese viaje:
básteme decir que fué en extremo próspero; que nuestra goleta dió
pruebas de ser una buena y ligera embarcación; que los tripulantes eran,
todos, marineros experimentados, y que el Capitán entendía muy bien lo
que traía entre manos. Pero antes de que llegá semos cerca de las costas
de la Isla del Tesoro, acontecieron dos ó tres cosas que es
indispensable referir para la inteligencia de esta narración.
Arrow, el Piloto, pronto se volvió mucho peor de lo que el Capitán había
temido: no tenía la menor autoridad sobre los marineros, los cuales
hacían con él lo que mejor les acomodaba. Pero no era esto lo peor, sino
que uno ó dos días después de nuestra partida comenzó á presentarse
sobre cubierta con los ojos inyectados, los pómulos enrojecidos, la
lengua torpe y todas las señales más evidentes de la embriaguez. Una vez
y otra se le tuvo que mandar á la cala, castigado. Algunas veces se caía
rompiéndose la cara; otras se echaba el día entero en su tarimón al lado
de la toldilla. Como una reacción, que duraba uno ó dos días, se le
miraba sobrio y listo atender á su trabajo, por lo menos pasablemente.
Pero entre tanto nosotros no podíamos averiguar en dónde tomaba lo que
bebía; este era el secreto misterioso de nuestro buque. Nuestra
vigilancia redoblada y multiplicada nada pudo; fué inútil cuanto hicimos
para descubrirlo. Solíamos preguntárselo abiertamente y entonces, una de
dos; ó nos reía á las barbas si estaba borracho, ó nos negaba tercamente
que se embriagase si acontecía que estuviera en su juicio, protestando
que no probaba nada que no fuese agua.
No solamente era inútil en su calidad de oficial del buque, y pésimo
como fuente de malas influencias entre los hombres de la tripulación,
sino que se veía muy claramente que, al paso que iba, muy pronto
acabaría por matarse contra todo derecho. Así es que nadie se sorprendió
ni se apenó mucho tampoco cuando en una noche muy oscura en que la mar
parecía menos sosegada que de costumbre el hombre aquel desapareció sin
que hubiéramos vuelto á verle más.
--¡Hombre al agua!, dijo el Capitán. En hora buena, señores, esto nos
ahorra la molestia de tener que mandarle poner grillos.
La cosa es que, desaparecido él, nos encontrábamos enteramente sin
piloto y era preciso, en consecuencia, ascender á uno de los
tripulantes. Job Anderson, el contramaestre, era el más apto de los de á
bordo, así fué que, aunque conservando su título primitivo, pasó á
desempeñar el cargo de piloto. El Sr. Trelawney que había estudiado la
marina y viajado mucho, como se recordará, tenía conocimientos que le
hacían muy útil en aquellas circunstancias, y realmente los puso en
práctica ejerciendo la vigilancia propia del piloto en los días en que
el tiempo era propicio. En cuanto al timonel Israel Hands, era un viejo
y experimentado marino, cuidadoso y astuto, de quien podía uno fiarse en
todo y para todo.
Era este el gran confidente de Silver, cuyo nombre me lleva á hablar de
nuestro cocinero Barbacoa, como la tripulación lo llamaba.
Á bordo de la embarcación cargaba este su muleta suspendiéndola al
cuello por medio de un acollador, á fin de tener ambas manos libres y
expeditas lo más que podía. Era digno de llamar la atención el verle
acuñar el pie de su muleta contra la abertura de alguna tablazón y
apoyándose en ella, despachar bonitamente su cocina, como podría hacerlo
algún hombre sano y completo en tierra. Pero todavía era más extraño
verle en los días de tiempo más malo atravesar la cubierta. Veíasele
trasladarse de un lugar á otro, ya usando su muleta, ya arrastrándola
tras sí por medio del acollador, tan rápida y expeditamente como pudiera
hacerlo un hombre que tuviera el uso de sus dos piernas. Y sin embargo,
algunos de los marineros, aquellos que ya habían hecho otras travesías
con él, decían que daba lástima el verle tan abatido.
--Este Barbacoa no es un hombre común; me decía una vez el timonel. Allá
en sus mocedades tuvo sus estudios y, cuando se ofrece, puede hablar
como un libro. Y valiente, ¡eso sí! Un león es nada comparado con
Barbacoa. Yo le he visto despachar á cuatro enemigos, de una sola vez,
haciéndoles morder el polvo, y sin tener él una sola arma en la mano.
Toda la tripulación le respetaba y aun puedo decir que le obedecía.
Poseía un modo muy peculiar de insinuarse al hablar á cada uno, y
siempre hallaba ocasión de hacer á todos un pequeño servicio. Respecto á
mí, Silver era siempre extraordinariamente amable y siempre se mostraba
contento de verme aparecer en su galera, que tenía siempre limpia y
brillante como un espejo: las cacerolas colgaban bruñidas y lustrosas y
su loro estaba en su reluciente jaula, en un rincón.
--Ven acá, Hawkins, ven acá, solía decirme. Ven á echar un párrafo con
tu amigo John. Nadie más bien venido que tú, hijo mío. Siéntate y ven á
oir lo que pasa. Aquí tienes al _Capitán Flint_--así le llamo yo á mi
loro en memoria del célebre filibustero--aquí tienes al _Capitán Flint_,
prediciéndonos el buen éxito de nuestro viaje. ¿No es verdad _Capitán_?
Y el perico, como si le dieran cuerda se soltaba gritando:
--¡Piezas de á ocho! ¡piezas de á ocho! ¡piezas de á ocho! ¡piezas de á
ocho!, y esto con una rapidez tal, que había que maravillarse de cómo
no se le acababa el aliento; y no cesaba hasta que Silver no sacudía su
pañuelo sobre la jaula del animal.
--Ahora bien, Hawkins, allí donde lo ves, ese pájaro debe tener ya lo
menos doscientos años. Casi todos ellos son poco menos que eternos y yo
creo, respecto de este, que solamente el diablo habrá visto más
atrocidades y horrores que él. Figúrate que éste fué del Capitán
England, del célebre y gran pirata England. Ha estado en Madagascar y en
Malabar; en Surinam, en Providencia y en Porto Bello. Este asistió á la
exploración y repesca de los buques cargados de plata echados á pique, y
allí fué donde aprendió su refrán de "_Piezas de á ocho_" lo cual no es
muy de maravillar, porque, figúrate Hawkins, que se sacaron de ellas más
de trescientas y cincuenta mil. Concurrió también al abordaje del Virrey
de las Indias, cerca de Goa, y al verle ahora, se creería que entonces
estaba recién nacido. Pero ya has olido la pólvora, ¿no es verdad
Capitán?
--¡Prepárate para el zafarrancho!, gritó el animal.
--¡Ah! este animalito es un joya, añadía el cocinero, alargándole trozos
de azúcar que sacaba de sus faltriqueras. Entonces el pájaro se pegaba á
los barrotes de su jaula y comenzaba á jurar y á maldecir redondo, de
una manera tan llena de maldad, que parecía increíble. Entonces John se
veía obligado á añadir:
--El que entre la brea anda, que pegarse tiene. Aquí tienes, si no, á
este inocente animalito mío, jurando como un desesperado y no por eso lo
debemos acusar. Puedes creer que lo mismo juraría, vamos al decir,
delante de monjas capuchinas y frailes descalzos.
Y John entonces se tocaba su melena de aquel modo solemne y peculiar que
él tenía y que me confirmaba á mí en la creencia de que aquel era el
mejor de los hombres.
En el entretanto, el Caballero y el Capitán continuaban todavía sus
relaciones en términos muy poco amistosos. El Caballero no hacía gran
misterio de sus sentimientos, sino que menospreciaba claramente al
Capitán. Este, por su parte, jamás hablaba sino cuando le dirigían la
palabra, y aun en esos casos, corto y seco y brusco, y ni una palabra
inútil. Reconocía, cuando se le llevaba á un rincón, que había estado
injusto y equivocado acerca de su tripulación; que algunos de sus
hombres eran tan vigorosos y aptos como él pudiera desearlos y que todos
se habían conducido hasta allí perfectamente bien.
Por lo que respecta á la goleta, estaba el hombre enamorado de ella, y
solía decir:
Siempre está lista para enfilar el viento, con más docilidad y ligereza
que si fuera una buena esposa complaciendo á su marido. No
obstante--añadía--todavía no estamos de vuelta en casa, y repito que no
me gusta esta expedición.
--Á estas últimas palabras, el Caballero volvía la espalda y se ponía á
recorrer la cubierta, dando aquel hombre al diablo como de costumbre.
--Una chanzoneta más de ese hombre, y un día de estos estallo, solía
decir.
Tuvimos un poco de mal tiempo, lo cual sirvió para probarnos las buenas
cualidades de _La Española_. Todos y cada uno de los hombres de á bordo
parecían contentos, y la verdad es, que hubieran pecado de sobra de
exigencia si hubiera sido de otra manera, pues tengo para mí que jamás
tripulación alguna estuvo más mimada y consentida desde que el Patriarca
Noé navegó en su bíblica arca. Con el menor pretexto doblábase el rom
cuotidiano, y el _pudding_ de harina en días extraordinarios, por
ejemplo, si el Caballero sabía que era el cumpleaños de alguno de los
marineros, y nunca faltaba un barril de buenas manzanas, abierto y
colocado en el combés, para que se despachara por su mano todo aquel á
quien le viniera el antojo de comerlas.
--Nunca he visto cosa buena salir de tratamientos parecidos, hasta
ahora, decía el Capitán al Dr. Livesey. Al que cuervos cría, éstos le
sacan los ojos: esta es simplemente mi opinión.
Sin embargo, _cosa buena_ resultó del barril de manzanas como se verá
muy pronto, que á no haber sido por él, nada nos habría prevenido á
tiempo y habríamos todos perecido á manos de la traición y de la
infamia.
Hé aquí lo que sucedió: habíamos hasta entonces navegado á favor de los
vientos alisios para ponernos en dirección de la isla que buscábamos. No
me es permitido ser más explícito. Y á la sazón bajábamos ya en sentido
opuesto manteniendo una asidua y cuidadosa vigilancia de día y de noche.
Aquél era ya el último día, según el más largo cómputo presupuesto para
el viaje, y de un momento á otro aquella noche, ó á más tardar la mañana
siguiente antes de medio día deberíamos llegar á la vista de la Isla del
Tesoro. Nuestra proa enfilaba al Sur-Suroeste y llevábamos una firme
brisa de baos, con una mar muy quieta. _La Española_ se deslizaba con
seguridad, sumergiendo en las ondas de cuando en cuando su bauprés, y
produciendo con él algo como pequeñas explosiones de espuma; todo seguía
su curso natural desde las gavias hasta la quilla, y todos parecían
llenos del más esforzado ánimo, supuesto que ya casi tocábamos con la
mano, por decirlo así, el fin de la primera parte de nuestra aventura.
En tales condiciones y ya mucho después de puesto el sol, cuando mi
trabajo del día estaba concluido y ya me iba en derechura á mi camarote
para dormir, ocurrióseme el deseo de comer una manzana. Subí sobre
cubierta. La vigilancia estaba toda á proa, como es natural, en espera
de descubrir la isla. El timonel observaba la orza de la vela y se
divertía silbando alegremente. Este era el ruido único que se escuchaba,
á excepción del rumor del mar que hendía la proa y que murmuraba
suavemente sobre los costados de la goleta.
Me lancé gentilmente hasta el fondo del gran barril de las manzanas en
busca de alguna, y me encontré con que apenas si habían quedado en sus
profundidades una ó dos. Crucéme de piernas tranquilamente en aquel
fondo oscuro, sin más intención que la de concluir con mi manzana; pero
ya fuese el monótono rumor del mar, ya el suave balanceo de la goleta en
aquel momento, el hecho es, ó que dormité por unos instantes ó que
estuve á punto de hacerlo, cuando un hombre pesado se sentó
repentinamente junto á mi escondite. El barril se estremeció cuando
aquel hombre recargó su espalda y ya iba yo á saltar afuera cuando el
recién venido comenzó á hablar. Era la voz de Silver y no había yo oído
una docena de palabras todavía, cuando ya no hubiera osado mostrarme ni
por todo el oro del mundo. Quedéme, pues, allí, trémulo y atento, en el
último extremo de la angustia y de la curiosidad, porque aquellas pocas
palabras bastaron para darme á entender que las vidas de todos los
hombres honrados que iban á bordo dependían de mí solamente.

CAPÍTULO XI
LO QUE OÍ DESDE EL BARRIL
--¡No! ¡yo no!, decía Silver. Flint era el Capitán: yo no era más que
contramaestre, con mi pierna de palo. En el mismo abordaje perdimos, yo
mi pierna y el viejo Pew la vista. Me acuerdo que fué un cirujano
recibido, con su título con muchos latines, que no había más que pedir,
el que me aserró esta pierna; pero todas sus retóricas y sus serruchos
no lo libraron de que lo ahorcáramos como á un perro y lo dejáramos
secándose al sol en el castillo del Corso. ¡Esos eran los hombres de
Flint, esos, sí señor! Eso también fué el resultado de cambiar nombre á
sus navíos, _Royal Fortune_ y otros. Pero yo digo que el nombre con que
han bautizado á un navío es el que debe quedársele. Así sucedió con _La
Casandra_ que nos trajo sanos y salvos á nuestra casa después que
England se apoderó del Virrey de Indias, y lo mismo con el viejo
_Walrus_ que era el antiguo buque de Flint y que yo ví rojo de sangre de
popa á proa, algunas veces, y otras repleto de oro hasta zozobrar con su
peso.
--¡Ah!, exclamó otra voz, que luego conocí por la del más joven de los
de la tripulación, y que expresaba la admiración más completa; ¡ah!
¡Flint sí que era la flor de toda esa banda!
--Davis también era todo un hombre cabal, no lo dudes, dijo Silver; yo
nunca navegué con él, sin embargo. Mi historia es esta: primero con
England, luego con Flint y ahora por mi cuenta... ¡vamos al decir! Yo
pude ahorrar novecientas libras durante mi servicio con England y dos
mil con Flint. Ya ves tú que eso no es poco para un simple marinero. Y
todo eso bien guardadito en el banco, muy guardado, no te quepa duda, ¿Y
qué se ha hecho hoy de los hombres de England? ¡No sé! ¿Y de los de
Flint? En cuanto á esos, la mayor parte están aquí, á bordo, con
nosotros. Al viejo Pew que había perdido la vista le tocaron mil
doscientas libras que--vergüenza da decirlo--gastó completamente en un
año, como puede hacerlo un Lord del Parlamento. ¿En dónde está ahora?
Muerto, bien muerto y bajo escotillas. Pero, dos años antes de morir...
¿qué hizo? ¡mil tempestades! ladrar de hambre como un perro; pedir
limosna, mendigar, robar, degollar gentes y con todo eso morirse de
hambre y de miseria... ¡voto al demonio!
--Voy creyendo que no sirve, pues, de mucho la carrera, observó el joven
catecúmeno de Silver.
--No le sirve de mucho á los manirrotos y locos; por supuesto que no,
replicó Silver. Pero en cuanto á tí, mira; tú eres un chicuelo todavía,
pero vivo como un zancudo. Yo te lo conocí en cuanto te puse el ojo
encima, y ya ves que te hablo como á un hombre hecho.
Se comprenderá sin esfuerzo lo que sentí al oir á este viejo y
abominable bribón dirigiendo á otro las mismísimas palabras aduladoras
que había usado para conmigo. Créaseme que si hubiera podido, con todo
mi corazón lo habría anonadado á través de mi barril. Pero él prosiguió,
entre tanto, muy ajeno de que alguien le estaba escuchando:
--Mira tú lo que sucede con los _caballeros de la fortuna_. Se pasan una
vida dura y están siempre arriesgando el pescuezo, pero comen y beben
como canónigos y abades, y cuando han llevado á cabo una buena
expedición, ¡cá! entonces... entonces los ves ponerse en las
faltriqueras miles de libras, en vez de puñaditos de miserables
peniques. Ahora, los más de ellos lo botan en orgías y francachelas,
también eso es cierto, y luego los ves volviendo al mar, en camisa, como
quien dice. Pero á fe que yo no he ido por semejante vereda. ¡No, que
no! Yo he puesto todo muy bien asegurado, un poquito aquí, otro poco
acullá, y en ninguna parte mucho para no excitar sospechas inútiles y
peligrosas. Ya tengo cincuenta años, fíjate bien, y una vez de vuelta de
esta expedición me establezco como un perezoso rentista. _Ya es tiempo
de ello_, me parece que replicas. ¡Ah, sí! pero puedo asegurarte que
entre tanto he vivido con desahogo. Jamás me he privado de nada que me
haya pedido el cuerpo; sueños largos, comidas apetitosas, y todo esto,
día por día, excepto cuando viajo por el agua salada, ¿Y cómo comencé?
Pues ni más ni menos que como tú ahora, de puro y simple marinero.
--Bueno, replicó el joven; pero lo que es ahora, todo ese otro dinero es
como si ya no existiera, ¿no es verdad? Porque á buen seguro que después
de esta expedición ¡vaya Vd. á dar la cara en Brístol!
--¡Bah! contestó Silver irónicamente. ¿Pues en dónde te figuras tú que
ese dinero estaba?
--Pues... en Brístol, es claro, en los bancos y á rédito; contestó su
interlocutor.
--Es verdad, allí estaba cuando levamos anclas; pero á la hora que es,
_mi mujer_... ya tú me entiendes... mi mujer lo tiene ya bien realizado,
y todo en su poder. La taberna del "Vigía" está ya vendida, ó arrendada,
ó regalada ó qué sé yo. Pero en cuanto á la muchacha, yo te aseguro que
ya ella ha salido de Brístol para reunírseme. Yo te diría de muy buena
gana en dónde va á esperarme, pero esto haría que nacieran celos entre
tus compañeros por mi preferencia, y no quiero celos aquí.
--¿Y tiene Vd. plena confianza en su... _mujer_, como Vd. la llama?,
preguntó el catecúmeno.
--Los _caballeros de la fortuna_, replicó el cocinero, generalmente
somos poco confiados entre nosotros mismos, y á fe que--puedes
creerlo--no nos falta razón para ello. Pero yo tengo unos modos míos muy
particulares; de veras que sí. Cuando un camarada es capaz de tenderme
una celada... quiero decir, uno que me conoce, ya puede estar seguro de
que no le será posible vivir en el mismo mundo que el viejo John. Había
algunos que le tenían miedo á Pew; otros que se aterrorizaban de Flint,
pero yo te digo que el mismo Flint no las tenía todas consigo tratándose
de mí, con ser quien era. Sí que me tenía miedo, y eso que estaba
orgulloso de mí, vamos al decir. Nunca ha habido sobre los mares una
tripulación más escabrosa que la de Flint, al extremo de que el diablo
mismo hubiera temido ir con ella á bordo. Pues, sin embargo, ya tú me
ves, no soy ningún finchado ni ningún fanfarrón, y sé hacer la compañía
con todos mis camaradas con tanta llaneza como si no fuera quien soy.
Pero cuando era yo contramaestre... ¡ah, diablo! entonces sí que no
podía decirse de ninguno de nuestra camada de viejos filibusteros que
fuese un _corderito_. ¡Ah! yo sé lo que te digo: puedes estar seguro de
tí mismo en este navío del viejo John.
--Está bien, replicó el mancebo; ahora le diré á Vd. que cuando vine
aquí no me gustaba el proyecto, ni _tanto así_; pero ahora que ya hemos
tenido esta explicación, John, ya sabe Vd. que cuentan conmigo, suceda
lo que suceda.
--Mucho que me alegro, porque tu eres un mocito de provecho, contestó
Silver sacudiendo la mano de su converso de la manera más cordial.
Puedes creer que no he visto en mi vida una apariencia mejor que la tuya
para ser uno de los _caballeros de fortuna_.
Al llegar aquí yo ya había comenzado á comprender que por _caballeros de
la fortuna_ entendían aquellos hombres ni más ni menos que piratas
comunes y corrientes y que aquella pequeña escena que yo había oído, era
nada más que el último acto en la corrupción de uno de los hombres
honrados que iban á bordo, tal vez ya el último de ellos. No obstante,
pronto debía recibir algún consuelo sobre este particular como se verá
luego. Silver, en aquel momento dejó oir un ligero silbido y un tercer
personaje apareció muy pronto y vino á reunirse á aquel conciliábulo.
--Dick es hombre de pelo en pecho, dijo Silver al recién venido.
--¡Oh! eso ya me lo sabía yo, replicó una voz que reconocí al punto por
la del timonel Israel Hands. Este Dick no tiene un pelo de tonto. Pero
vamos allá, prosiguió; lo que yo quiero saber es esto, Barbacoa; ¿tanto
tiempo nos vamos todavía á quedar afuera en esta especie de maldito bote
vivandero? Yo digo que ya tengo bastante de Capitán Smollet, con mil
diablos; ya bastante me ha aburrido, y ya quiero poder instalarme en su
cámara; ya quiero sus _pickles_, ya quiero sus vinos, ya quiero todo
eso.
--Israel, le replicó Silver, tú has tenido ahora y siempre cabeza de
chorlito. Pero creo que te podrá entrar la razón, ¿no es esto? Abre,
pues, las orejas, que bien grandes las tienes para oirme lo que te voy á
decir ahora mismo: seguirás durmiendo á proa, y seguirás pasándola
penosamente y seguirás hablando con suavidad, y seguirás bebiendo con la
mayor mesura hasta que yo dé la voz, y entre tanto te conformarás con lo
que te digo.
--Está bien, yo no digo que no, gruñó el timonel. Lo único que yo digo
es esto: _¿cuándo?_ ¡Eso es todo!
--¿Cuándo? ¡mil tempestades!, exclamó Silver. Con que cuándo, ¿eh? Pues
mira, puesto que lo quieres, voy á decirte cuando. Hasta el último
momento que me sea posible: ¡entonces! aquí traemos á un excelente
marino, á este Capitán Smollet, que viene dirigiendo en provecho nuestro
el bendito buque. Aquí traemos igualmente á ese Caballero y á ese Doctor
con su mapa y demás cosas que nos interesan y que ni yo ni Vds. sabemos
en dónde diablos las guardan. Enhorabuena; entonces tenemos que aguardar
que este Caballero y este Doctor encuentren la hucha y nos ayuden hasta
á ponerla á bordo del buque, con cien mil diantres. Entonces veremos. Si
yo estuviera bien seguro de Vds., hijos del demonio, dejaría al Capitán
Smollet que nos condujera de vuelta hasta medio camino, antes de dar el
golpe definitivo.
--¿Acaso no somos marinos todos los que estamos aquí á bordo? Yo creo
que sí, dijo el muchacho Dick.
--Quieres decir que entendemos la maniobra, ¿no es verdad?, prorrumpió
Silver. Nosotros podemos seguir una dirección dada, ¿pero quién puede
darnos esta? He ahí en lo que se dividen todas las opiniones de Vds.
desde el primero hasta el último. En cuanto á mí, si yo pudiera obrar
conforme á mi solo deseo, dejaría al Capitán Smollet que nos llevara
hasta última hora en nuestro regreso, para no exponernos á cálculos
erróneos y á andar luego á ración de agua por esos mares del diablo.
Pero yo se muy bien qué casta de bichos son Vds. y... no hay remedio,
acabaré con ellos en la isla, tan luego como nos hayan ayudado á poner
la hucha á bordo, lo cual es una lástima. ¡Que reviente yo en hora mala
si no es cosa que enfullina y disgusta el navegar con zopencos como
Vds.!
--Eso sí que es hablar por hablar, exclamó Israel. ¿Quién te da motivo
para enojarte, John?
--¡Hablar por hablar!, replicó exaltado Silver. ¿Pues cuántos navíos de
alto bordo te figuras tú que he visto al abordaje, y cuantos vigorosos
muchachos secándose al sol en la Plaza de los Ajusticiados y todo esto
solamente por esta maldita prisa? ¿Me oyes bien? Pues mira; yo he visto
una que otra cosa en el mar, puedes creerlo, y te digo que si Vds. se
limitaran á poner sus velas siguiendo el viento que sopla, llegarían,
sin duda, un día al punto de arrastrar carrozas, ¡por supuesto! ¡Ah!
¡pero no será así! Los conozco muy bien á Vds. Comenzarán por andar de
taberna en taberna, ahitos de rom, y mañana ú otro día ya irán por sus
pasos contados á hacerse ahorcar.
--Todos sabíamos bien que tú has sido siempre una especie de abad, John.
Pero hay otros que han podido maniobrar y gobernar tan bien como tú,
dijo Israel. Y sin embargo, á ellos les gustaba un poco el jaleo y la
diversión. Ellos no eran tan entonados ni tan severos, después de todo,
sino que entraban á la bromita, tomando su parte como camaradas alegres
y de buen humor.
--Es verdad, dice Silver, es muy verdad. Sólo que ¿en donde están esos á
la hora presente? Pew era de ese jaez y ha muerto de limosnero. Flint
era también así y murió de rom en Savannah. ¡Oh! muy alegres y muy
divertidos que eran, sí señor; pero lo repito, ¿en dónde están ahora?
--Todo eso está muy bien, interrumpió Dick, pero lo que yo pregunto es
esto: cuando demos el golpe y tengamos á nuestros hombres pie con mano,
¿qué vamos á hacer con ellos?
--Eso se llama hablar en plata, dijo Silver con un tono de gran
admiración. Este muchacho me gusta. ¡Al negocio y sólo al negocio! Está
bien; pero Vds. ¿qué opinan? ¿Los dejamos en tierra en esa isla desierta
como Robinsones? Eso sería lo que hubiera hecho England. ¿Ó los
degollamos sencillamente como á cerdos? Este hubiera sido el
procedimiento de Flint ó de Billy Bones.
--Billy era el hombre para estas cosas, dijo Israel. "Los muertos no
muerden," solía decir. El muy taimado ya sabe á qué atenerse sobre ese
punto, puesto que ya él mismo está debajo de tierra, pero si alguna vez
mano alguna fué dura é implacable, esa era sin duda la de Billy.
--Tienes razón, observó Silver, dura, pero pronta. Ahora bien,
entendámonos. Yo soy un hombre complaciente, casi un caballero, como
Vds. dicen; pero amigos míos, por hoy la cosa es seria. El deber es el
deber, y este antes que todo. He aquí cual es mi parecer: _matarlos_.
Cuando yo me haya convertido en un Lord, y ande tirado en carrozas, no
quiero que ninguno de estos tinterillos de primera cámara, se me pueda
aparecer un día, cuando menos lo espere, como el diablo á la hora del
rezo. Pero lo único que digo es esto: aguardemos, y cuando el tiempo
oportuno llegue démonos gusto degollando á uno tras otro.
--¡John, exclamó el timonel, eres todo un hombre!
--Ya dirás eso cuando me veas á la obra, Israel, dijo Silver. Para
entonces no reclamo más que una cosa, y es que no me quiten á Trelawney.
Quiero darme el placer de cortar con mis propias manos esa cabeza de
res.
Y como cortando la conversación repentinamente, añadió:
--Oye, Dick, salta y dame una manzana de aquí del barril, para remojarme
un poco el gaznate.
Se comprenderá el espantoso terror que sentí al escuchar esto. Hubiera
yo saltado y echado á correr, si hubiera tenido la fuerza suficiente
para ello, pero no tuve ni piernas ni ánimo y permanecí inmóvil. Oí que
Dick comenzaba á levantarse, pero en el instante mismo alguien lo
contuvo y se oyó la voz de Hands, decir:
--¡Oh! ¡deja eso! no vas á chupar semejante _pantoque_, John. Echemos
una ronda de lo fino.
--Tienes razón, Dick, dijo Silver. En el barril del rom tengo puesta una
sonda, con su llave respectiva. Llénate una vasija y súbela en seguida.
Terrificado como estaba, no pude impedirme el pensar que así quedaba
explicado el misterio de la fuente en que el piloto Arrow bebía las
_aguas_ que acabaron por matarle.
Dick se fué por un rato no muy largo, pero durante su ausencia Israel
habló al oído del cocinero en voz muy baja pero animada. Yo pude apenas
recoger dos ó tres frases, pero en ellas supe, sin embargo, algo
interesante, pues además de otras palabras que tendían á confirmarlo,
esto llegó muy distintamente á mis oídos:
--Ninguno otro de ellos quiere ya entrar en el negocio.
Claro era, por lo tanto, que todavía nos quedaban hombres leales á
bordo.
Cuando Dick volvió, cada uno de los del terno aquel tomó sucesivamente
la vasija del rom y le hizo los honores concienzudamente, bebiendo, el
uno "_¡al buen éxito!_" otro "_¡por el viejo Flint!_" y cerrando Silver
la ronda con estas palabras:
    _¡A nuestra salud! y orza al estribor_
    _¡Presas y fortuna! ¡dinero y amor!_
En aquel punto cierta claridad cayó sobre mí, adentro del barril; alcé
la vista y me encontré con que la luna acababa de aparecer en el cielo,
plateaba la gavia de mesana y comunicaba un tinte blanquecino á la palma
del trinquete. Casi en el mismo instante la voz del vigía se alzó
gritando:
--¡Tierra! ¡tierra!

CAPÍTULO XII
CONSEJO DE GUERRA
Pasos precipitados sonaron por donde quiera al grito de _¡tierra!_
apresurándose todos á subir sobre cubierta, tanto mis amigos de la
cámara de popa como las gentes de la tripulación. Yo salté rápidamente
afuera de mi barril; me deslicé cubriéndome con la vela de trinquete, dí
la vuelta hacia el alcázar de popa y volví sobre cubierta por el camino
de todos los demás, á tiempo de reunírmeles en el acto de acudir á proa.
Todo el mundo estaba ya congregado allí. Una cinta de niebla se había
alzado casi al mismo tiempo que aparecía la luna. Allá á lo lejos, hacia
el sudoeste, divisábamos dos montañas no muy altas, como á unas dos
millas de distancia y por encima de una de ellas aparecía una tercera
eminencia, notablemente más alta que las otras, y cuya cumbre se miraba
todavía envuelta entre las gasas de la niebla. Las tres parecían de
figura aguzada y cónica.
Esto fué, á lo menos, lo que yo creí ver, puesto que aún no me recobraba
de mis terrores de hacía dos ó tres minutos. En seguida oí la voz del
Capitán Smollet dando órdenes. _La Española_ fué puesta unos dos puntos
más cerca de la dirección del viento y comenzó á enderezar el rumbo de
tal manera que enfilaría precisamente la costa oriental de la isla.
--Y ahora muchachos, dijo el Capitán, cuando la maniobra estuvo
ejecutada, ¿alguno de Vds. ha visto esa tierra antes de ahora?
--Yo, dijo Silver. Siendo cocinero de un buque mercante anclamos en ella
para proveernos de agua.
--El fondeadero está al Sur, tras un islote, ¿no es esto?, preguntó el
Capitán.
--Sí señor, el islote del _Esqueleto_ que le llaman. Este lugar ha sido
alguna vez abrigadero de piratas, y un hombre que llevábamos á bordo
sabía los nombres de todos aquellos sitios. Aquel cerro al Norte le
llaman _El Trinquete_. Hay tres cerros colocados en línea hacia el Sur y
que les llaman, con nombres marinos, _El Trinquete_, _El Mayor_ y _El
Mesana_. Pero el principal es el más grande, que tiene el pico sumido en
la nube. Lo llamaban también el _Cerro del Vigía_, á causa de la
vigilancia que desde su cima mantenían esos hombres, mientras sus
embarcaciones permanecían al ancla limpiando sus fondos, con perdón de
Vd., porque aquí es donde ellos llevaban á cabo esa operación.
--Aquí tengo un mapa, dijo el Capitán Smollet; vea Vd. si este es el
lugar que Vd. dice.
En los ojos de Silver pasó algo como un relámpago de alegría feroz al
tomar la carta que le alargaba el Capitán. Pero en el instante mismo en
que sus ojos cayeron sobre el papel, le conocí que su esperanza de un
segundo sufría una terrible decepción. Aquel no era el mapa encontrado
en la maleta de Billy Bones, sino una copia cuidadosa en todos sus
detalles, nombres, alturas y sondajes, con la sola excepción de las
cruces rojas y de las notas manuscritas. Sin embargo, por aguda que haya
sido la contrariedad de Silver, tuvo la presencia de ánimo necesaria
para dominarse y aparecer sereno.
--Sí señor, contestó, este es el lugar según entiendo, y muy bien
trazado ciertamente. ¿Quién habrá sido el autor de esta carta? Los
piratas eran demasiado ignorantes, á lo que creo, para poder dibujar
esto. ¡Ah! ¡vamos! aquí está marcado "_Ancladero del Capitán Kidd_";
precisamente este es el nombre que le dió mi Patrón. Allí existe una
fuerte corriente á lo largo de la costa Sud y luego sube en dirección
Norte, á lo largo de la costa occidental. Tenía Vd. razón, prosiguió, en
ceñir el viento y poner la proa hacia la isla, por lo menos si su
intención era que entrásemos luego y carenar allí, porque la verdad es
que en todas estas aguas no hay lugar más á propósito que ese.
--Gracias, mi amigo, dijo el Capitán Smollet. Más tarde creo que pediré
á Vd. algunos otros informes para ayudarnos en algo. Puede Vd.
retirarse.
No pude menos que sorprenderme al ver la sangre fría con que Silver
confesaba su conocimiento de la isla. Por mi parte, yo continuaba medio
aterrorizado todavía y me sentí más aun cuando ví á aquel hombre
acercarse á mí, más y más. Por supuesto que ni remotamente se figuraba
que hubiese yo escuchado su conciliábulo desde el fondo de un barril de
manzanas, y sin embargo, en aquel punto había yo cogido tal horror de su
crueldad, doblez y poderío, que muy mal contuve un estremecimiento
nervioso cuando su mano tomó mi brazo mientras él me decía:
--¡Ah, muchachuelo! Aquí tienes un precioso lugar para un chico como tú,
en esta isla. Aquí puedes bañarte, trepar á los árboles, cazar cabras
monteses, todo lo que quieras. Tú mismo podrás ir como las cabras
subiéndote á los más altos peñascos y montañas. ¡Ah! créeme que me
rejuvenece todo esto y casi casi me iba ya olvidando de mi pierna de
palo. Linda cosa es ser uno joven y tener uno sus veinte dedos cabales,
puedes estar seguro. Cuando quieras ir á hacer un paseíto de
exploración, nada más avísale á tu viejo amigo John y él cuidará de
darte tu cestilla de víveres muy bien arreglada, para que la lleves
contigo.
Dicho esto me dió una palmada sobre el hombro de la manera más amistosa,
se alejó cojeando y se perdió en el interior de las galeras.
El Capitán Smollet, el Caballero y el Doctor Livesey se quedaron
conversando junto al alcázar de proa. Á pesar de mi impaciente ansiedad
por contarles lo que la casualidad me había hecho oir, no me atreví á
interrumpirlos abiertamente. Entre tanto y cuando más absorto estaba yo
en mis pensamientos para encontrar alguna excusa probable, el Doctor
Livesey me llamó. Habíasele olvidado su pipa abajo en la cámara, y, como
era un verdadero esclavo del tabaco, me iba á indicar que bajara á
traérsela, sin duda. Pero en cuanto que estuve bastante cerca de él para
que me oyese él solo, le dije rápidamente:
--Doctor, permítame Vd. que le hable. Llévese consigo al Capitán y al
Caballero inmediatamente abajo á la cámara, y con cualquier pretexto
manden Vds. por mí. Tengo nuevas terribles.
El Doctor pareció desconcertarse por un instante, pero en el acto fué
otra vez dueño de sí mismo.
--Gracias, Jim, dijo en voz bien alta; eso es todo lo que quería saber.
Fingía, con esto, haberme hecho alguna pregunta á la que yo hubiese
respondido.
En seguida giró sobre sí mismo y se volvió á reunir al grupo de que
formaba parte. Hablaron los tres por algunos momentos y aun cuando
ninguno de ellos dió muestras de sobresalto ni levantó la voz, me
pareció evidente que el Doctor Livesey les acababa de comunicar mi
súplica, porque lo primero que llegó á mis oídos fué que el Capitán daba
órdenes á Job Anderson y el silbato sonó luego llamando sobre cubierta á
toda la tripulación.
--Muchachos, dijo el Capitán en cuanto que todos estuvieron reunidos;
tengo dos palabras que decir á Vds. Esa tierra que acabamos de ver es el
lugar de nuestro destino. El Patrón de este buque, hombre muy liberal y
generoso, según todos lo sabemos por experiencia, acaba de hacerme dos
preguntas que yo he podido contestar diciéndole que cada marinero de
esta goleta ha cumplido con su deber, desde el tope hasta la cala, de
tal manera que nada mejor pudiera pedirse. Por tal motivo él, el Doctor
y yo, vamos á la cámara á beber á la salud y buena suerte de todos
ustedes, mientras que á Vds. se les servirá un buen _grog_ para que
brinden, á su vez, por nosotros. Yo les daré á Vds. mi opinión sobre
esto: yo lo encuentro magnífico. Si Vds. son de mi parecer, les
propondré, pues, que envíen un buen aplauso al caballero que así se
porta.
El aplauso se dejó oir, esto era claro; pero estalló tan compacto y tan
cordial, que confieso que me fué difícil convencerme de que aquellos
mismos que lo daban estaban arreglando tramas infernales contra nuestras
vidas.
--¡Un aplauso más por el Capitán Smollet!, gritó Silver cuando el último
hubo cesado.
Lo mismo que el anterior, este segundo aplauso parecía enteramente
sincero y voluntario.
Apenas pasado esto los tres caballeros bajaron á la cámara y no pasó
mucho rato sin que enviasen un recado diciendo que se necesitaba á Jim
Hawkins en el salón.
Encontrélos á todos tres en torno de la mesa, con una botella de vino
español y algunas uvas delante de ellos; el Doctor fumando fuerte y con
la peluca puesta sobre sus rodillas, lo cual me constaba que era un
signo de agitación en él. La ventanilla de popa estaba abierta porque la
noche era bastante cálida, y podía verse perfectamente desde dentro el
resplandor de la luna cintilando sobre la estela de nuestro buque.
--Ahora bien, Hawkins, díjome el Caballero, parece que tienes algo que
decirme: habla ya.
Hícelo como se me mandaba y, sin alargarme demasiado, conté todos los
detalles de la conversación de Silver. Ninguno trató de hacer la más
pequeña interrupción hasta que todo lo hube dicho; ni ninguno tampoco
hizo movimiento de ninguna especie, sino que todos tres mantuvieron sus
ojos clavados en mi semblante desde el principio hasta el fin de mi
narración.
--Siéntate, Jim, díjome el Doctor.
Hiciéronme lugar entonces á la mesa, junto á ellos, sirviéronme un vaso
de vino y me pusieron en las manos un gran racimo de uvas; y todos tres,
con un saludo cordial, bebieran á mi salud, felicitándome por mi valor
y por mi buena suerte.
--Ahora, Capitán, dijo el Caballero, es ya tiempo de proclamar que Vd.
estaba en lo justo y yo estaba equivocado. Me declaro sencillamente un
borrico y espero las órdenes de Vd.
--Nadie más borrico que yo, replicó el Capitán. Yo no he visto jamás
tripulación alguna tramando una rebelión que no deje escapar
perceptiblemente algunos signos de su descontento, de manera que todo
hombre que no es ciego puede ver el peligro y tomar las medidas
necesarias para evitarlo. Pero confieso que esta tripulación derrota
toda mi experiencia.
--Capitán, dijo el Doctor, con su permiso diré que esta es obra de
Silver y que este es un hombre muy notable.
--Me parece que muy notable aparecería colocado en un peñol de las
vergas, replicó el Capitán. Pero esto no es más que charla que no
conduce á nada. He fijado mi atención en tres ó cuatro puntos y con
permiso del Sr. de Trelawney voy á exponerlos.
--Caballero, dijo el Sr. Trelawney en un tono solemne, Vd. es el Capitán
y á Vd. es á quien toca hablar.
--Primer punto, comenzó el Capitán Smollet: tenemos que seguir adelante
porque es ya imposible retroceder. Si esto último se intentara la
rebelión estallaría inmediatamente. Segundo punto: tenemos á nuestra
disposición tiempo hasta que se encuentre ese tesoro. Tercer punto:
todavía nos quedan hombres leales á bordo. Ahora bien, señores, es una
cosa que no tiene remedio el que tarde ó temprano debamos entrar en
hostilidades. Hay que tomar, pues, á la calva ocasión cuando nos
presente sus cabellos, es decir, propongo que seamos nosotros los que
rompamos el fuego, el día más á propósito y cuando ellos menos lo
esperen. Me parece, Sr. de Trelawney que podremos fiar en los criados de
su casa, ¿no es verdad?
--Tanto como en mí mismo, declaró el Caballero.
--Tres, dijo el Capitán, y con nosotros cuatro, somos ya siete,
incluyendo á Hawkins. ¿Y cuántos serán los hombres leales?
--Muy probablemente, replicó el Doctor, han de ser los contratados
personalmente por Trelawney antes de que se hubiera echado en brazos de
Silver.
--No por cierto, replicó el Caballero. Hands es uno de esos hombres.
--Yo hubiera creído que podríamos tener fe ciega en este último, dijo el
Capitán.
--¡Y pensar que todos ellos son ingleses!, prorrumpió el Caballero,
¡Señores, crean Vds. qué ganas me vienen de hacer volar este buque!
-Pues bien, señores, agregó el Capitán, lo mejor que yo puedo decir
ahora es bien poco. Debemos tenernos por advertidos y mantener la más
expecta vigilancia. Esto es desagradable para un hombre, yo lo sé.
Preferiría, por lo mismo, que desde luego se rompieran las hostilidades,
pero no tendremos ayuda suficiente para que no sepamos cuales son
nuestros hombres. Estémonos quietos y esperemos la oportunidad; ese es
mi parecer.
--Este Jim, dijo el Doctor, puede sernos más útil que todo lo demás que
hagamos. El enemigo no tiene ninguna mala voluntad respecto de él y yo
sé que él es un chico muy observador.
--Hawkins, añadió el Caballero, en tí pongo una fe ciega y completa.
Al oir esto no dejaba de comenzar á sentirme punto menos que desesperado
porque me sentía sin apoyo enteramente. Y sin embargo, por un extraño
encadenamiento de circunstancias, no fué sino por mi conducto por el que
todos nos salvamos. En el entretanto, por más vueltas que se le diera al
asunto, el hecho es que de veintiséis hombres á bordo, no había sino
siete con los que se pudiera contar, y todavía de esos siete uno no era
más que un niño; de suerte que, en realidad, los hombres hechos y
derechos que teníamos de nuestro lado eran seis, para diez y nueve de
nuestros enemigos.

PARTE III
MI AVENTURA DE TIERRA
CAPÍTULO XIII
CÓMO EMPEZÓ LA AVENTURA
Cuando subí sobre cubierta á la mañana siguiente, el aspecto de la isla
había cambiado en gran manera. Aun cuando la brisa de la víspera había
cesado ya, el camino hecho durante la noche era muy considerable y á la
sazón nos encontrábamos detenidos como á una media milla al Sudeste de
la costa baja oriental. Bosques de un color pardo cubrían una gran parte
de la superficie de aquella tierra. Sin embargo, ese tinte se
interrumpía aquí y acullá por las listas amarillentas de la arena, en
los terrenos más bajos y por algunos árboles más elevados, de la familia
de los pinos, que se alzaban sobre las copas de los otros, algunos de
ellos aislados y dispersos, otros reunidos; pero el aspecto y el
colorido general de la isla era triste y uniforme. Los cerros se alzaban
libremente por encima de la vegetación, en espirales de desnudas rocas.
Todos eran de extraña configuración y el del "Vigía" que sobrepasaba en
trescientos ó cuatrocientos pies á la eminencia próxima á él en
elevación, era probablemente el de aspecto más raro, alzándose casi
derecho, por todos lados y apareciendo después cortado repentinamente en
la cima, como si fuese un pedestal listo para recibir una estatua.
_La Española_ vaciaba á torrentes sus imbornales en la agitada
superficie de un _mar de leva_. Los botalones chocaban con los motones,
el timón golpeaba de un lado y otro y todo el navío rechinaba y parece
que gemía y temblaba como una gran fábrica en operación. Yo me veía
obligado á asirme á los brandales de los masteleros con todas mis
fuerzas y sentía que el mundo entero daba vueltas vertiginosamente en
torno de mi cabeza, porque aun cuando yo era ya un marino bastante
bueno, cuando el buque iba en marcha, aquella movible inmovilidad
(permítaseme la frase), aquel meneo desesperante sin salir de un punto y
aquel verme rodado de aquí para allá como una botella suelta, fueron
cosas que jamás afronté sin sentirme desfallecido, sobre todo en la
mañana y cuando el estómago estaba completamente vacío.
Quizás fué por esto; tal vez fué por el aspecto de la isla con sus
cenicientos y melancólicos bosques, con sus salvajes espirales de rocas
y con su marejada que podíamos ver y oir quebrándose tronante y espumosa
en la escarpada costa; el hecho es que, aunque el sol brillaba claro y
ardiente y los pájaros costaneros pescaban y gritaban alegremente en
torno nuestro, y aun cuando era de creerse que después de tantos días de
no ver más que agua y cielo todos deberían sentirse contentos de saltar
á tierra, mi valor y mi sangre toda, como dice el adagio, se habían
bajado á los talones, y desde el primer instante en que mis ojos la
veían, aquella esperada _Isla del Tesoro_ me inspiraba el más profundo y
cordial aborrecimiento.
Tuvimos que afrontar aquella mañana, de todas maneras, un trabajo
ímprobo y pesado. No había la menor traza de viento y hubo necesidad, en
consecuencia, de echar los botes al agua y ponerlos al remo para
remolcar la goleta en una extensión de tres ó cuatro millas rodeando la
isla hasta penetrar por el estrecho paso que nos condujo á la rada ó
abrigo que se abre tras del _Islote del Esqueleto_. Yo me ofrecí
espontáneamente para uno de los botes, en el cual, como es de suponerse,
nada tenía que hacer. El calor era sofocante y los hombres al remo
gruñían abiertamente á causa de su tarea. Ánderson tenía el mando del
bote en que yo iba y en lugar de conservar á su tripulación en orden,
gruñía él mismo tan alto y tan groseramente como el que más.
--Pero no hay cuidado, dijo con una blasfemia; al fin esto no es para
siempre.
Parecióme este un malísimo signo, porque lo cierto es que hasta aquel
día nuestros hombres habían desempeñado sus tareas voluntaria y
vigorosamente; pero la sola vista de la isla había ya bastado para
relajar las cuerdas de la disciplina.
Durante toda esta travesía Silver se estuvo junto al timonel y dirigió,
en realidad, el buque. Él conocía el paso como la palma de su mano y así
es que, aun cuando el hombre que estaba maniobrando á las cadenas
encontró por todas partes más agua de la que marcaban los sondajes del
mapa, John no vaciló ni un solo momento.
--Hay siempre un grande arrastre con el reflujo, dijo él, y este paso ha
sido, puede decirse, ahondado como con un azadón.
Llegamos, por fin, al punto preciso marcado en el mapa como ancladero,
como á un tercio de milla de las costas, de la isla principal, por un
lado, y del _Islote del Esqueleto_ por el otro. El fondo era arena pura.
Cuando nuestra ancla se sumergió en el agua, se levantó una verdadera
nube de aves acuáticas revoloteando y chillando sobre nuestras cabezas,
lo mismo que sobre los árboles, pero un minuto después habían vuelto á
sus nidos y todo había quedado de nuevo en el más completo silencio.
Nuestro fondeadero estaba enteramente rodeado de tierra, sepultado en
medio de bosques por todos lados, cuyos árboles bajaban hasta la marca
más alta de la pleamar; las playas eran casi enteramente llanas y allá,
en una especie de anfiteatro distante; se divisaban las cimas de las
montañas, una aquí, otra más allá. Dos riachuelos ó más bien dos
pantanos, desaguaban en aquel que muy bien pudiéramos llamar estanque.
En cuanto al follaje en torno de aquella parte de la playa, presentaba
yo no sé qué especie de ponzoñoso brillo.
Desde á bordo no alcanzábamos á ver nada de la casa ó estacada que había
allí, porque estaban demasiado ocultas entre la espesura de los árboles
y á no haber sido por la carta que nos acompañaba hubiéramos podido
creer muy bien que nosotros éramos los primeros que arrojábamos el ancla
en aquel sitio desde que la isla brotó del fondo de las aguas.
No soplaba ni la más pequeña ráfaga de viento, ni se oía más sonido que
el de la resaca tronando á media milla de distancia sobre las playas,
contra las abruptas peñas de las costas. Sentíase un olor peculiar y
desagradable, en donde estábamos anclados, olor como de hojas y troncos
de árboles en putrefacción. Yo pude observar que el Doctor absorbía
aire y hacía muecas con la nariz, como las que puede hacer uno que está
probando un manjar ingrato.
--Yo no respondo de que aquí haya ó no tesoros, dijo, pero en cuanto á
fiebres, apuesto mi peluca á que este es un semillero de ellas.
Entre tanto, si la conducta de los marineros era alarmante en el bote,
se hizo ya realmente amenazadora cuando volvieron á bordo de la goleta.
Estábanse agrupados sobre cubierta y refunfuñando en medio de su
conversación. La orden más insignificante era recibida con miradas
torvas y murmuraciones entre dientes y no se la obedecía sino con
verdadera negligencia. Es posible que aun los no contaminados en el
motín, se hubiesen ya contagiado con la relajación de la disciplina,
porque lo cierto es que no había á bordo hombre alguno á propósito para
corregir á otros. La rebelión--esto era palpable--estaba ya suspensa
sobre nuestras cabezas como una tempestad próxima á desencadenarse.
Y no sólo los pasajeros de cámara éramos los que comprendíamos el
peligro. John Silver trabajaba infatigablemente yendo de grupo en grupo,
distribuyendo consejos a todos y siendo un modelo verdadero con su
ejemplo de sumisión y dulzura. Nada podía igualarse en aquellos momentos
á su comedimiento y cortesía; era una perenne sonrisa la que había en
sus labios para todos y cada uno de nosotros. Si se le mandaba algo, al
punto saltaba sobre su muleta, clamando con el tono más complaciente del
mundo: "_¡Corriendo, corriendo, señor!_" Y cuando no había nada especial
que hacer, él cantaba una canción tras de otra como si tratara de
ocultar con ellas el descontento de los demás.
De todos los detalles sombríos de aquella tenebrosa tarde, esa notoria
ansiedad de John Silver se me figuraba el peor de todos.
Celebramos consejo otra vez en el gabinete de popa.
--Señores, dijo el Capitán, si aventuro la más insignificante orden, la
tripulación entera se nos viene á las barbas. Aquí tienen Vds. lo que
pasa: se me da una respuesta áspera, ¿no es esto? Pues bien, si replico
en un tono más alto, las cuchillas saldrían luego á relucir á mandobles.
Si no hago esto, si me callo, Silver notará al punto que hay algo por
debajo de nuestro silencio y entonces queda todo el juego descubierto.
Ahora bien: no hay más que un hombre en quien podamos fiar en la
situación actual.
--¿Y quién es él?, preguntó el Caballero.
--Silver, replicó el Capitán. Él está tan impaciente como Vds. y como yo
mismo de sofocar las cosas. Lo que hay es un disgusto; pronto él les
hablará á sus hombres para calmarlos si se le presenta la ocasión. Lo
que yo propongo, en consecuencia, es darle la oportunidad que busca.
Vamos dejándolos que pasen una tarde en tierra. Si todos se van, está
bien, nosotros pelearemos encastillados en nuestro barco. Si ninguno
quiere bajar, entonces nos mantenemos en nuestra cámara de popa y Dios
ayude la buena causa. Si algunos van, acuérdense Vds. de lo que les
digo, Silver los volverá á bordo más mansos que unos corderos.
Así se acordó. Al mismo tiempo se proveyó á todos los hombres de
confianza de pistolas cargadas; Hunter, Joyce y Redruth fueron puestos
en autos de lo que pasaba y por fortuna recibieron la confidencia con
menos sorpresa y más valor del que nos habíamos figurado; con lo cual,
el Capitán fuese sobre cubierta y arengó á la tripulación.
--Muchachos, les dijo, hemos tenido un día sofocante y todos estamos
cansados y sin alientos de nada. Yo creo, sin embargo, que un paseo por
la playa no le hará mal á ninguno: los botes están todavía á flote.
Pueden Vds. tomar los esquifes y, todos los que gusten, ir á tierra por
el resto de la tarde. Yo tendré cuidado de disparar un cañonazo media
hora antes de la puesta del sol.
Yo me supongo que aquellos malvados han de haberse figurado que todo era
desembarcar y caer sin más ni más sobre el tesoro, porque en un instante
todos ellos echaron instantáneamente el mal humor á paseo y
prorrumpieron en un aplauso y en un _hurra_ espontáneo, tan estruendoso,
que despertó los ecos dormidos de una de las montañas distantes y
produjo un nuevo levantamiento de aves que revolotearon y chillaron otra
vez en número infinito en torno nuestro.
El Capitán era demasiado vivo para saber lo que convenía en aquellos
críticos momentos, así es que, sin aguardar respuesta alguna se eclipsó
como por encanto, dejando á Silver el cuidado de arreglar la partida, en
lo cual creo que obró perfectísimamente. Si se hubiera quedado un
momento más sobre cubierta le hubiera sido imposible prolongar por más
tiempo su pretendida ignorancia de lo que sucedía. Esto era ya claro
como la luz meridiana. Silver era el Capitán y disponía de una imponente
tripulación de rebeldes. Los hombres aun no corrompidos (y pronto iba yo
á ver la prueba de que los había á bordo) deben haber sido unos hombres
de muy poco talento. O, por lo menos, supongo que la verdad era que
todos estaban disgustados por el ejemplo de los cabecillas, sólo que
unos lo estaban más que otros, y que, algunos de ellos, siendo en el
fondo buenos sujetos, no podían ser ni convencidos ni arrastrados á ir
más allá que el simple disgusto. Una cosa es sentirse con lasitud y mal
humor y otra muy diferente el pensar en apoderarse de un navío
asesinando á un buen número de personas inocentes.
Por fin la partida quedó organizada. Seis de ellos se quedaron á bordo y
los trece restantes, incluyendo á Silver comenzaron á embarcarse.
Fué entonces cuando me ocurrió la primera de las insensatas ideas que
contribuyeron á salvar nuestras vidas. Si Silver dejaba á seis de sus
hombres, era claro que nuestro grupo no podía montarse en la goleta, en
pie de guerra, como en una fortaleza; y no siendo los de la dicha
reserva más que seis, era también indudable que el bando de popa no
necesitaba por el momento de ninguna ayuda. Ocurrióseme, pues,
instantáneamente el ir á tierra. En un abrir y cerrar de ojos me deslicé
sobre la balaustra y dejándome correr por una de las escotas de proa,
caí dentro de uno de los botes en el instante mismo en que se ponía en
movimiento.
Ninguno notó mi presencia; sólo el remero de proa me dijo:
--¡Ah! ¿eres tú Jim? Baja bien la cabeza.
Pero Silver desde el otro bote comenzó á lanzar miradas penetrantes é
investigadoras para tratar de averiguar si era yo el que iba allí. Desde
ese mismo instante comencé á arrepentirme de lo que había hecho.
Los dos grupos de marineros se divertían remando á cual más fuerte, en
una especie de carrera de apuesta, á cuál de los botes llegaba primero á
la playa. Mas como el bote que me había cabido en suerte ocupar había
recibido mayor empuje, estaba más ligero é iba mucho mejor remado, muy
pronto dejó muy atrás á su competidor. La proa ya había atracado en
medio de los arbustos de la playa; ya me había yo cogido de una rama y
lanzádome hacia fuera, emboscándome en el acto en el matorral más
próximo, cuando Silver y los suyos estaban todavía á unas cien yardas
detrás.
--¡Jim, Jim!, le oí que me gritaba.
Pero ya se supondrá que no hice maldito el caso de sus gritos.
Brincando, agazapándome, rompiendo breñas, corrí y corrí por el terreno
que se me presentaba delante, al acaso, desaforadamente, hasta que
materialmente ya no pude más.

[Illustration]
CAPÍTULO XIV
EL PRIMER GOLPE
Me sentía yo tan satisfecho de haber dejado á Silver con un palmo de
narices, que ya comenzaba á recrearme y á pasear mis ojos ávidamente por
la extraña tierra en que me encontraba.
Había cruzado ya un trecho cenagoso, lleno de sauces, juncos, feos y
lodosos arbustos de vegetación más acuática que de tierra, y acababa de
llegar á las faldas de un terreno abierto, ondulado y arenoso, como de
una milla de largo, dotado con uno que otro pino y un gran número de
árboles tortuosos, no muy diferentes del roble en su configuración, pero
de hojas pálidas como las del sauce. En el término abierto de aquel
terreno se alzaba uno de los cerros, con dos picos extraños, fragosos y
escarpados que reverberaban vívidamente al sol.
Por la primera vez de mi vida sentía el gozo y la emoción del
explorador. La isla estaba deshabitada. Mis camaradas quedaban á la
espalda y nada viviente tenía ante mis ojos sino eran animales de tierra
y aire, mudos para mí. Aquí y acullá se alzaban algunas plantas en flor
que me eran totalmente desconocidas; más allá veía culebras una de las
cuales alzó su cabeza sobre su nido de piedra, miróme y lanzó una
especie de silbido muy parecido al zumbar de una peonza. Bien ajeno
estaba yo de que aquel enemigo llevaba la muerte consigo y que su
silbido no era otra cosa que el famoso cascabel.
Llegué, en seguida, á un espeso grupo de aquellos árboles á manera de
robles cuyo nombre, según lo supe después, era el de árbol de la vida,
que crecían bajos, entre la arena, como zarzas, con sus brazos
curiosamente trenzados y con sus hojas compactas como una pasta
artificial. El monte se alargaba hacia abajo desde la cima de una de las
lomas arenosas, desplegándose y creciendo en elevación conforme bajaba,
hasta llegar á la margen del ancho y juncoso pantano, á través del cual
desaguaba, en el fondeadero, el más pequeño de los riachuelos que morían
en él. El marjal vaporizaba bajo los ardientes rayos de un sol tropical,
y la silueta del "Vigía" palpitaba con las rápidas ondulaciones de la
bruma solar.
De repente comenzó á notarse cierto bullicio entre el juncal de la
ciénaga: un pato silvestre se levantó gritando; otro le siguió, y muy
pronto se vió sobre toda la superficie del marjal una nube verdadera de
pájaros revoloteando, gritando y revolviéndose en el aire. Desde luego
supuse que alguno de mis compañeros de navegación, debía de andar cerca
de los bordes del pantano, y no me engañé, en mi suposición, pues muy
pronto llegaron hasta mí los rumores débiles y lejanos de una voz humana
que, mientras más escuchaba, más distinta y más próxima llegaba á mis
oídos.
Esto me infundió un miedo terrible y ya no pude más que agazaparme bajo
la espesura del más cercano grupo de _árboles de la vida_ que se me
presentó, y acurrucarme allí, volviéndome todo oídos, y mudo como una
carpa.
Otra nueva voz se dejó oir contestando á la primera y luego ésta, que
conocí luego ser la de Silver, se alzó de nuevo y se desató en una
verdadera avalancha de palabras que duró por largo tiempo interrumpida
apenas de vez en cuando por una que otra frase de la otra voz. Á juzgar
por las entonaciones deben haber estado hablando acaloradamente, tal vez
con ira, pero ninguna palabra llegó distintamente á mis oídos.
Al fin los interlocutores hicieron, al parecer, una pausa y tal vez,
supuse yo, se habrían sentado, porque no sólo sus voces cesaron de
aproximarse, sino que los pájaros empezaron ya á aquietarse y la mayor
parte de ellos á volver á sus nidos en el pantano.
Comencé entonces á temer que estaba yo faltando á las obligaciones que
voluntariamente me había impuesto, por el solo hecho de haber venido á
tierra con aquellos perdidos, y á decirme que lo menos que podía hacer
era escuchar sus conciliábulos, acercándome á ellos, tanto como me fuese
posible, á favor de los espesos zarzales y de los árboles echados por
tierra.
Me era fácil fijar la dirección de los dos interlocutores, no sólo por
el sonido de sus voces sino también por el cálculo que me permitían
hacer los pocos pájaros que todavía revoloteaban alarmados sobre las
cabezas de los intrusos.
Marché agazapado, en cuatro pies, y muy callandito, pero muy en
derechura hacia ellos, hasta que, por último, alzando un poco la cabeza
á la altura de un pequeño claro entre el ramaje, pude ver distintamente,
en el borde de una pequeña hondonada cubierta de verdura, cerca del
pantano y respaldada por los árboles, á John Silver y á otro de los de
la tripulación, conversando frente á frente.
El sol caía de lleno sobre ambos. Silver había arrojado á un lado su
sombrero, sobre el césped, y toda su enorme, rasa y rubicunda cara,
sudorosa y brillante con el calor, estaba fija en el semblante de su
interlocutor como en demanda ó espera de alguna cosa.
--Mira, camarada, decía Silver, si yo no creyera que tú valías oro en
polvo, puedes creerlo como lo digo, oro en polvo, sí señor, yo no te
habría traído á este negocio cuando ya está caliente como perol de brea
hirviendo. Si así no fuera, yo no estaría aquí previniéndote. Todo está
ya dispuesto y listo y tú no puedes ni hacer ni remediar nada. Si yo
trato de convencerte es sólo para salvarte el pescuezo, pues puedes tú
creer que si alguno de aquellos salvajes lo supiera, ¿dónde estaría yo,
Tom, dónde estaría yo?
--Silver, replicó el otro (y yo pude observar que no solamente tenía
roja la faz, sino que también su voz era ronca como la de un cuervo, y
oprimida como por una cuerda muy apretada), Silver, Vd. es ya viejo, Vd.
es honrado ó pasa al menos por tal, Vd. tiene además una fortunita que
infinitos marinos le envidiarían, Vd. es valiente, si no me equivoco.
Pues bien, dígame Vd., ¿va Vd. á dejarse gobernar por esa caterva de
sucios lampazos? ¡Yo creo que no! Y tan cierto como que Dios me ve en
este momento, preferiré que me arranquen la mano antes que faltar á mi
deber...!
Repentinamente fué su palabra interrumpida por un ruido inesperado.
Acababa yo de ver á unos de los hombres honrados de á bordo y acto
continuo iba á tener noticias de otro de ellos. Allá á lo lejos, al otro
lado del pantano, se oyó súbitamente un rumor como un grito de angustia,
luego otro y después un largo y horroroso alarido. Las rocas del "Vigía"
lo repitieron con sus ecos varias veces; la bandada de aves acuáticas
tornó á alzarse de nuevo, nublando el cielo, con un chillido simultáneo,
y todavía aquel alarido de muerte no cesaba de vibrar en mi cerebro,
cuando el silencio había ya restablecido su imperio y no se escuchaba
más rumor que el suave aleteo de los pájaros bajando de nuevo á sus
nidos y el murmullo distante de la marea perturbando débilmente la
languidez de la tarde.
Al resonar aquel grito de suprema angustia, Tom se había puesto en pie
de un salto, como un caballo que siente el acicate, pero Silver no había
siquiera pestañeado. Quedóse en donde estaba, apoyándose apenas en su
muleta y con los ojos clavados en su compañero como una víbora lista
para abalanzarse.
--¡John!, gritó el marinero, extendiendo su mano hacia Silver.
--¡No me toques!, replicó éste, saltando hacia atrás como una yarda,
según me pareció, con toda la destreza y seguridad de un gimnasta de
profesión.
--No lo tocaré, si Vd. lo quiere así, John Silver; dijo Tom. Sólo una
conciencia negra puede hacer que me tenga Vd. miedo; pero en nombre del
cielo, dígame Vd., ¿qué ha sido ese grito?
Silver sonrió de una manera horrorosa, siniestra, pero sin perder su
actitud cautelosa y expectante. Sus ojos, de ordinario pequeños, no eran
en aquel momento más que unos puntos como la cabeza de un alfiler en su
inmensa caraza, pero relampagueando como dos carbunclos.
--¿Ese grito?, dijo aquella furia, ese grito me supongo que ha sido de
Alán.
Al oir esto el pobre Tom prorrumpió como un héroe:
--¿Alán?... ¡Descanse, pues, en paz esa alma de marino leal! Por lo que
hace á Vd. Silver, Vd. ha sido hasta hoy un camarada mío, pero desde hoy
ya no lo es Vd.! Si me mata como á un perro ¡qué importa! moriré
cumpliendo con mi deber. ¿Conque ha hecho Vd. matar al pobre Alán, no?
¡Pues máteme también á mí, si puede, le desafío á ello!
Y al decir esto aquel bravo y leal muchacho, volvió la espalda al
cocinero y se puso en marcha, dirigiéndose hacia la playa. Sin embargo,
no era su destino el ir muy lejos. Con un grito salvaje John se afianzó
á la rama de un árbol, se sacó violentamente la muleta de bajo el brazo
y lanzó aquel improvisado proyectil, con una fuerza inaudita, zumbando
por el viento y alcanzando al pobre Tom á quien golpeó con horrible
violencia entre los dos hombros, en medio de la espalda. Sus manos se
agitaron en el aire, dió una especie de boqueada y cayó de frente contra
el suelo.
Nada podré decir sobre si aquel golpe fué mortal ó no. Sin embargo, á
juzgar por el sonido, es casi seguro que la espina fué rota con el
choque; pero no tuvo tiempo para recobrarse en lo más mínimo, porque
Silver, ágil como un orangután, aunque sin muleta ni ayuda alguna, cayó
sobre su víctima en un momento y en menos tiempo del que tardo en
contarlo había ya hundido dos veces su largo cuchillo hasta la
empuñadura, en aquel desdichado inerme. Desde mi escondite de arbustos
pude oir los resoplidos feroces de su respiración al sepultar su arma
innoble en aquel cuerpo sin defensa.
Yo no sé hasta qué punto tendrá un hombre el derecho de desmayarse, pero
si sé que por cierto tiempo, en aquel instante, me pareció que el mundo
entero daba vueltas en derredor de mí, en un remolino nebuloso; Silver y
los pájaros y el altísimo "Vigía" danzaban ante mis ojos en un
torbellino, todos invertidos, mientras mil campanas diferentes,
mezcladas con ecos distantes, repicaban furiosamente en mis oídos.
Cuando me hube recobrado un poco, el monstruo ya se había compuesto y
_organizado_ de nuevo, por decirlo así, con su sombrero sobre la cabeza
y su muleta bajo el brazo. Junto á él yacía precisamente el cuerpo
inmóvil é inanimado del pobre Tom, sobre la tierra, sin que su asesino
se ocupara por eso en lo más mínimo, pues lo pude ver que, con una calma
verdaderamente satánica, limpiaba en el césped la sangre de que estaba
empapada la hoja de su puñal. Todo lo demás continuaba en el mismo
estado, sin el menor cambio: el sol radiando despiadadamente sobre el
marjal que vaporizaba y sobre el alto pico de la montaña. Y á mí me
parecía imposible persuadirme de que un asesinato se acababa de cometer
allí, delante de mis ojos, que una vida humana había sido brutalmente
segada en mi presencia misma.
Ví luego á John Silver llevarse la mano á la bolsa, sacar un silbato y
hacer vibrar varias veces sus moduladas notas que volaron á través de la
atmósfera caliginosa. No me era posible, por de contado, explicarme la
significación de aquella señal, pero sí me dí cuenta de que con ella se
despertaban de nuevo todos mis temores antecedentes. Los demás hombres
iban á acudir y estaba, pues, en peligro de ser descubierto. Acababan de
asesinar á dos de nuestros leales y honrados hombres, ¿no era muy
posible que después de Tom y Alán me tocase el turno á mí?
En un abrir y cerrar de ojos me comencé á internar, agazapado siempre y
con todo el silencio y velocidad que me fuera posible, hacia la parte
del monte más abierta. Mientras ejecutaba este movimiento, pude oir
todavía saludos cambiados entre el viejo pirata y sus camaradas, y á
este rumor, indicante claro de mi peligro, sentí que me nacían alas en
los pies. No bien estuve fuera de la espesura, eché á correr como jamás
había corrido antes en mi vida, sin cuidarme de la dirección que seguía,
sino en cuanto que ella me alejaba de los asesinos, y mientras más
corría, el miedo más y más se agigantaba en mi alma hasta tornarse en un
verdadero frenesí de terror.
Y en verdad, ¿podía haber alguien en situación más perdida de todo punto
que la mía? Cuando tronase el cañonazo ofrecido, ¿cómo iba yo á
atreverme á presentarme en los botes, en medio de aquellos entes
infernales, cuyas manos humeaban todavía con la sangre de sus víctimas?
¿Acaso el primero de ellos que me viera no iba á torcerme el cuello como
á una agachona? ¿Acaso mi sola ausencia no era ya para ellos una
evidencia de mi alarma, y por consiguiente, de mi fatal conocimiento de
los hechos? Todo, pues, había concluído para mí. ¡Adiós _La Española_,
adiós el Caballero, el Doctor y el Capitán! ¡Nada me quedaba ya que
esperar sino la muerte por inanición, ó á manos de los sublevados!
Mientras esto pensaba, no cesaba de correr, y sin darme cuenta de ello,
me encontraba ya cerca del pie de uno de los pequeños picos, y habíame
internado á una parte de la isla en que los árboles de la vida crecían
más distantes unos de otros y se asemejaban más á verdaderos árboles de
bosque por su corpulencia y dimensiones. Entremezclados con estos había
uno que otro pino, algunos de ellos como de cincuenta pies de altura y
otros como hasta de setenta. El aire tenía ya aquí también un olor más
fresco que allá abajo cerca del pantano.
Pero al llegar á este sitio, una nueva alarma me esperaba, que me hizo
sentir el corazón á punto de escapárseme del pecho.

CAPÍTULO XV
EL HOMBRE DE LA ISLA.
De uno de los lados del cerro que era, en aquel sitio, escarpado y
pedregoso, un guijarro se desprendió por el cauce seco de una de las
vertientes cascajosas, saltando, rebotando y haciendo estrépito en sus
choques repetidos contra árboles y piedras. Volví los ojos
instintivamente en aquella dirección y ví una forma extraña moverse y
ocultarse tras del tronco de uno de los árboles. ¿Era aquello un oso, un
hombre, ó un orangután? Me era imposible decirlo. Me parecía negro y
velludo; pero esto era lo único de que me podía dar cuenta en aquel
momento. Sin embargo, el terror de esta nueva aparición me hizo
contenerme en mi carrera.
Me veía, según toda probabilidad, cortado por el frente y por la
retaguardia: detrás de mí, los asesinos, y delante aquella forma
indescriptible que me acechaba. En el acto comencé á preferir los
peligros que me eran conocidos á aquellos que aparecían velados. El
mismo Silver se me figuraba ya menos terrible comparándolo con aquella
extravagante criatura, especie de gnomo de la montaña, y así fué que,
sin más vacilaciones le volví la espalda, no sin volverme azoradamente
para verle sobre el hombro, y comencé á correr de nuevo, esta vez en
dirección de los botes.
Pero en pocos segundos la horrible figura, después de dar una gran
vuelta, se me igualó en la carrera y aun comenzó á avanzar delante de
mí. Yo estaba bien exhausto ya, no cabía duda, pero aun cuando hubiese
estado fresco y descansado, ví muy pronto que era una locura el
pretender luchar en velocidad con adversario semejante. De un tronco á
otro aquella extraña criatura parecía volar como un ciervo, corriendo á
semejanza del hombre, en dos pies, pero diferenciándose de la carrera
humana en que como ciertas aves se dejan ir en el espacio por largo
tiempo con las alas cerradas, esta se deslizaba á trechos hacia abajo
por la pendiente, de una manera fantástica, maravillosa é inexplicable
para mí. Y sin embargo, era un hombre, ya no me era posible dudarlo por
más tiempo.
Vínome á la imaginación en el acto todo cuanto había oído ó leído sobre
caníbales y aun estuve á punto de gritar ¡socorro! Pero el mero hecho de
ser aquel un hombre, aunque fuese un salvaje, me había ya serenado un
poco, y el miedo que Silver me inspiraba reapareció vivo y formidable en
mi ánimo. Me detuve, pues, por el momento, y buscando en mi atribulada
imaginación alguna puerta de salvamento ó de escape, me acordé, de
pronto, de la pistola que llevaba conmigo. Y no hice más que recordar
que no estaba tan indefenso, y sentí que el valor volvía á mi corazón, y
dando el rostro resueltamente al hombre de la isla, marché hacia él con
paso vigoroso.
En este momento él estaba oculto tras de otro tronco de árbol, pero debe
haberse estado espiándome muy atentamente, porque tan luego como yo me
adelanté hacia donde él estaba, se mostró de repente y dió un paso para
venir á mi encuentro. Pero acto continuo vaciló, dió algunos pasos hacia
atrás, luego otros hacia mí de nuevo, hasta que, por último, con
extraordinaria sorpresa y confusión mía, le ví caer de rodillas y
tenderme en ademán suplicante sus manos enclavijadas:
Al ver esto, torné á detenerme indeciso.
--¿Quién es Vd.?, le pregunté.
Á lo cual se apresuró él á contestarme con una voz ronca, opaca, como el
rumor que produjese una cerradura enmohecida y en desuso.
--¡Soy Ben Gunn! Soy el pobrecito Ben Gunn que por tres años no ha
tenido delante un cristiano con quien hablar!
Al oir esto pude ya darme cuenta de que aquel no era un caníbal, como lo
creí al principio, sino un hombre de raza blanca como yo, y aun observé
que sus facciones eran regulares y agradables. Su cutis, en todos los
puntos que aparecía descubierto, estaba tostado por el sol; sus labios
mismos estaban ennegrecidos y sus ojos claros eran una cosa sorprendente
en aquel conjunto de facciones oscuras. De todos los mendigos que en mi
vida había yo podido ver ó figurarme, era éste el número _uno_ por lo
destrozado y harapiento. Estaba vestido con girones de lona de velámen,
añadidos y mezclados con retazos informes de paño azul-marino, y toda
aquella extraordinaria estructura de andrajos estaba sujeta y rodeada á
su persona, por la más incongruente y exótica reunión de broches y
costuras: botones de metal, espinas de pescado, correas de pieles
crudas, pedacitos de madera á guisa de agujetas, y presillas de
alquitranados cordones. Ciñendo su talle llevaba un viejo cinturón de
cuero con hebilla de metal, cuya prenda era la única cosa sólida y sin
soluciones de continuidad de todo cuanto llevaba encima.
--¡Tres años!, exclamé yo. ¿Naufragó Vd. acaso cerca de esta costa?
--No, amigo mío, me _aislaron_[4] aquí.
Yo había oído esa palabra aplicada á una especie de castigo horrible,
muy común entre los piratas, cuya esencia era desembarcar al condenado
en una isla inhabitada, dejándole solamente un fusil y una poca de
pólvora y abandonándolo allí para siempre.
--¡_Aislado_ por tres años!, continuó aquel mísero. Tres años mortales
durante los cuales he vivido de cabras monteses, de berzas silvestres y
de ostras de la playa. Yo sé que donde quiera que un hombre se encuentre
colocado, aquel hombre puede ayudarse y valerse por sí mismo. Pero,
amigo, mi corazón ya suspira por alguna comida de cristianos. Tú traerás
allí por casualidad un pedacillo de queso, ¿no es verdad?... ¡Pues
dámelo, anda!... ¿No traes?... ¡Ah! ¡si tú supieras qué noches tan
largas me he pasado aquí, soñando con una tajadilla de queso, con una
tostada, sobre todo! Y luego me despertaba... ¿y qué?... ¡Aquí!...
¡siempre aquí!
--Si Dios quiere que alguna vez pueda yo volver á bordo, le prometo á
Vd. que tendrá queso hasta ahitarse, le repliqué.
Todo el tiempo que había durado nuestro corto diálogo anterior, Ben Gunn
no había cesado de asentar con su mano el paño de mi jubón, de tocarme
suavemente las manos, de contemplar mis botas y, en una palabra, de
manifestar el placer más infantil con la presencia de un semejante suyo.
Pero al oir mis últimas frases se enderezó de repente con cierta especie
de sobresalto.
--Si Dios quiere que puedas volver á bordo, ¿has dicho? Y bien, ¿quién
es el que te lo impide?
--No es Vd., por cierto, le contesté.
--Y dices muy bien en eso, exclamó. Pero antes de pasar adelante, vamos
á ver, ¿cómo te llamas, camarada?
--Jim, le dije.
--Jim, Jim, repetía él con aparente complacencia. Ahora bien, Jim, ya
debo decirte que yo he vivido una vida tan borrascosa que ni aun me
atrevo á contártela, porque te avergonzarías sólo de oirme. ¿Creerás tú,
al escuchar esto, que yo nunca tuve una madre, buena y piadosa, para
dirigirme y velar por mí?
--¡No! no he pensado tal cosa, le respondí.
--¡Ah!, dijo él. ¡Pues sí que la tuve y muy santa y muy piadosa! Yo era
un muchachito paisano, muy bueno y muy aprovechado, que me sabía tan
bien mi catecismo que cuando me soltaba recitándolo, lo repetía, como si
fuera una sola palabra, y sin respirar, desde el principio hasta el fin.
¡Ah! pero aquí va ahora lo que sucedió, Jim. Un día comencé á jugar á
las _canicas_ y al hoyuelo; por allí comencé, no te quepa duda. Mi
pobrecita madre me sermoneaba y me decía lo que me iba á suceder, ¡pobre
señora, me acuerdo muy bien! Pero la Providencia me trajo aquí. Yo no he
cesado de pensarlo en todo el tiempo que he estado olvidado en esta
isla desierta y, lo que es ahora, ya me siento bueno otra vez. Ya nadie
me volverá á coger nunca probando el rom... á no ser un dedalito... nada
más que un dedal por accidente, cuando se me presente una ocasión.
Inevitablemente ya, tengo que ser bueno y sé cuál es el camino para
lograrlo, porque, óyeme bien, Jim...--y al decir esto vió en torno suyo
y bajó la voz hasta convertirla en un murmullo--... ¡soy muy rico!
Al escuchar esto, no me cupo duda sobre que aquel desgraciado se había
vuelto loco en su soledad, y supongo que debo haber dejado conocer mi
pensamiento en mi semblante, porque él se apresuró á repetir
calurosamente:
--¡Rico, rico, sí señor! Yo te diré cómo y haré de tí todo un hombre,
Jim. ¡Ah, muchacho, dale á Dios una y mil veces gracias de que hayas
sido tú la primera criatura humana que se ha encontrado conmigo!
Pero no bien había pronunciado estas palabras su semblante se oscureció
repentinamente, como si se viese asaltado por una idea ingrata; estrechó
mi mano con mayor fuerza entre las suyas y levantó el dedo índice ante
mis ojos con un ademán amenazador diciendo:
--Pero ante todo Jim, dime la verdad... ¿no es ese de allí el buque del
Capitán Flint?
Oyendo esto me vino una inspiración rápida y feliz. Comencé á creer que
lo que yo había encontrado, era un aliado, y en tal concepto me apresuré
á contestarle:
--No, por cierto. Flint ha muerto. Pero si le he de decir á Vd. la
verdad, como Vd. me lo pide, á bordo de esa goleta vienen varios de los
hombres del tal Flint, por desgracia de todos los demás de la partida.
¿No viene un hombre con una sola pierna?, murmuró Ben Gunn.
--¿Silver?, le pregunté.
--¡Ah! ¡Silver!, contestó él. ¡Silver! ¡eso es... ese es su nombre!
--Es el cocinero de á bordo y al mismo tiempo el cabecilla ó director de
esos hombres.
Al llegar aquí, Ben Gunn, que todavía me tenía cogido por la muñeca,
dióme una especie de fuerte sacudida.
--Si tú has sido enviado aquí por John Silver, dijo, yo estoy ya tan
bueno como un cerdo, muy bien lo sé. ¿Pero en qué pensaste tú, muchacho?
Yo había ya formado mi resolución en un instante, así es que, por vía de
respuesta, le conté la historia completa de nuestro viaje y el difícil
predicamento en que nos encontrábamos á aquellas horas. Escuchóme él con
el más profundo interés y cuando hube concluído exclamó dándome una
palmadilla en la cabeza:
--Jim, tú eres un buen muchacho, y tú y los tuyos están en un apuro del
demonio, ¿nó es esto? Pues no tengas cuidado. Ten confianza en mí. Ben
Gunn es el hombre para sacarlos de su varadero. Pero antes dime, ¿crées
tú que tu Caballero resultará ser un hombre bastante liberal para quien
sepa sacarlo del aprieto en que se ve metido?
--¡Oh! en cuanto á eso, el Caballero es el hombre más liberal y generoso
que yo he conocido, le respondí.
--Pero hay que ver bien, dijo Ben Gunn; yo no quiero decir que me
recompensará dándome una covacha de conserje para guardar una puerta; ó
una librea dorada de lacayo, ó cosa por el estilo. ¡Oh, no! Lo que yo
quiero decir es que si me daría, por ejemplo, un buen millar de libras
esterlinas, contantes y sonantes, que es tanto cuanto puede apetecer
para ser dichoso un hombre como yo. ¿Qué dices tú?
--Pues digo que estoy seguro de que sí lo haría, le respondí yo. Tal
como venían las cosas todos los expedicionarios estábamos llamados á
dividirnos la hucha.
--¿Y me dará también un pasaje á Inglaterra?, añadió con una mirada
recelosa y desconfiada.
--¿Pues cómo no?, le dije. El Sr. de Trelawney es un hombre de honor. Y
además de esto, ¿no ve Vd. que si con su auxilio logramos
desembarazarnos de los otros, necesitaríamos de Vd. sin remedio para
ayudarnos á maniobrar el buque?
--¡Ah! ¡pues es verdad!, replicó Ben Gunn. ¡Yo les sería indispensable!
Y con esto pareció como aliviado de un gran peso.
--Ahora, prosiguió, voy á contarte cómo pasaron los sucesos, ni más ni
menos. Yo estaba á bordo del buque de Flint cuando éste sepultó aquí su
tesoro. Él se vino á tierra con seis hombres, grandes, fuertes.
Permanecieron aquí cerca de una semana, y nosotros, entre tanto, allá
afuera... esperando... anclados en el fondeadero, en su viejo buque el
_Walrus_. Un hermoso día, vimos por fin la señal esperada. Flint venía
por sí solo... solo enteramente en su pequeño bote, con su cabeza
vendada con una banda azul... El sol comenzaba á levantarse y él
aparecía pálido... pálido como un muerto junto al tajamar... ¡Pero allí
estaba, eso sí! En cuanto á los otros seis... ¡todos muertos! ¡muertos
y enterrados!... ¿Cómo se arregló para ello? Ninguno de los que íbamos á
bordo pudo averiguarlo nunca, ¿Fué lucha leal, asesinato, sorpresa, que
fué?... ¡Quién sabe! Lo único que sabíamos es que ellos eran seis y él
no era más que uno... ¡uno contra seis! Billy Bones era el piloto del
barco; John Silver era el contramaestre y ambos le preguntaron dónde
quedaba oculto el tesoro.--"¡Ah!, contestó él, si Vds. quieren ir á
averiguarlo pueden irse á tierra y quedarse allí buscando. Lo que es el
barco vuelve á la mar en busca de más, con mil diablos!" Eso fué lo que
él dijo!... Tres años después de aquello me cupo en suerte venir en otro
buque. Cuando vimos la isla yo dije:--"Ea, muchachos; el tesoro del
Capitán Flint está aquí. ¡Vamos bajando á tierra y encontrémoslo!"--El
Capitán se disgustó con esto, pero mis camaradas fueron todos de mi
opinión y bajamos á tierra. Doce días consecutivos buscaron y buscaron
en vano. Creían que yo les había jugado una horrible burla y cada día me
llenaban de nuevos y más duros insultos, hasta que una mañana, ya
cansados y sin esperanzas se volvieron todos á bordo.--"Por lo que hace
á tí Benjamín Gunn, me dijeron al partir, aquí tienes un mosquete, un
pico y una azada: quédate aquí y encuentra para tí solo el tesoro del
Capitán Flint!"... Tres años hace de esto, Jim; tres años que he estado
aquí sin probar un solo platillo de cristianos, hasta hoy!... Pero, dime
ahora... mírame... ¿tengo yo el aspecto de un marinero?... ¡Ya te oigo
murmurar que no!... ¡Ah!, es que yo también lo digo... yo... ¡yo mismo!
Al decir esto me guiñó los ojos y me oprimió la mano fuertemente. Y
luego prosiguió:
--Tú nada más repítele á tu Caballero mis propias palabras, Jim. Díle
esto: "Tres años hace que Ben Gunn es el único habitante de esta isla,
lo mismo á la hora de la luz que en medio de la noche, lo mismo en la
tempestad que en el buen tiempo. Tal vez algunas ocasiones ese
pobre--díle--tal vez ha pensado en su anciana madre, que anciana ha de
ser si vive aún; quizás, á veces, habrá caído de rodillas para decir una
oración. Pero la mayor parte del tiempo de Ben Gunn se ha empleado en
otro asunto." Y al decirle esto le darás un pellizco como este que te
doy aquí.
É hízolo como lo decía, de la manera más confidencial que imaginarse
pueda, prosiguiendo en el acto:
--Pero continuarás al punto y le dirás: "Gunn es un buen chico, no cabe
duda y él _deposita él precioso don_ de su confianza, _deposita él
precioso don_ de su confianza--no olvides decírselo con esas mismas
palabras--en un Caballero por nacimiento, más que en cualquiera de esos
"_caballeros de la fortuna_" de los cuales él ha sido uno."
--Pero vamos allá, le dije yo; prescindiendo de que no alcanzo á
entender una palabra de todo lo que me ha estado Vd. diciendo aquí,
¿cómo podría yo repetírselo al Caballero si no veo la posibilidad de
volver á bordo?
--¡Ah! allí está la vuelta del cabo! Y bien, aquí está mi bote; mi bote
que yo he fabricado con mis propias manos. Yo lo tengo oculto bajo la
peña blanca. Si sucede lo peor de lo peor, creo debemos intentar esa
travesía después de que oscurezca...
En este punto tuvo que interrumpirse bruscamente, porque aun cuando el
sol tenía todavía una hora ó más que alumbrar hasta ocultarse en el
horizonte, oímos repentinamente, repetido por todos los ecos de la isla,
el trueno imponente de un cañonazo.
--¡Eh! ¿qué es eso?, preguntó Ben Gunn.
--Es que han comenzado á batirse, le contesté. ¡Sígame Vd.!
Y olvidando en aquel punto todos mis terrores precedentes me dí á correr
hacia la rada, en dirección del ancladero, acompañado por el hombre
_aislado_ que corría junto á mí velozmente, sobre sus cacles de piel de
cabra, con gran ligereza y facilidad.
--¡Á la izquierda! ¡á la izquierda!, me decía. ¡Cárgate siempre hacia la
izquierda, camarada!, repetía. ¡Quién diría que yo voy aquí bajo los
árboles, contigo! Mira, allí es donde maté mi primera cabra. Ahora ya no
bajan hasta acá; ahora las tienes siempre encaramadas en sus masteleros,
allá entre las jarcias y los motones de sus montañas, todo, no más que
por miedo de Ben Gunn! ¡Ah! mira tú... ¡allí tienes el cementerio! ¿no
ves sus terraplenes?... Cuando por mis cuentas creo que debe ser
domingo, sabes tú,... suelo venir aquí y me arrodillo y rezo. No tiene
esto muchas trazas de capilla, ni siquiera de una pobre ermita, ¿no es
verdad?... pues, mira tú... yo le encuentro no sé qué cosa de solemne y
de imponente. Y luego, ya lo ves, no he tenido las manos muy llenas...
ni una biblia, ni una enseña... y en cuanto á capellán, pues... ni
soñarlo.
Y seguía así, charla y charla mientras corríamos, sin esperar ni recibir
respuesta alguna.
Un rato considerable había trascurrido después del disparo del cañón,
cuando oímos una descarga de armas de menos calibre.
Siguióse otra pausa, y luego, á menos de un cuarto de milla frente á mí,
divisé repentinamente en el aire, flotando sobre las cimas de los
árboles del bosque, la gloriosa bandera de Inglaterra.

PARTE IV
_LA ESTACADA_
CAPÍTULO XVI
EL DOCTOR PROSIGUE LA NARRACIÓN Y REFIERE CÓMO FUÉ ABANDONADO EL BUQUE
Sería la una y media de la tarde cuando los dos botes de _La Española_
se fueron á tierra. El Capitán, el Caballero y yo estábamos discurriendo
acerca de la situación en nuestra cámara de popa. Si hubiera soplado en
aquellos momentos la brisa más ligera, hubiéramos caído por sorpresa
sobre los seis rebeldes que se nos había dejado á bordo, hubiéramos
levado anclas y salido á alta mar. Pero el viento faltaba de todo punto
y para completar nuestro desamparo, vino muy pronto Hunter á traernos la
nueva de que Hawkins se había metido en uno de los botes y marchádose
con los expedicionarios de la isla.
Jamás nos ocurrió poner en duda la lealtad de Hawkins, pero sí nos
pusimos en alarma por su vida. Con la excitación en que aquellos hombres
se encontraban nos parecía que sólo una casualidad podía hacer que
volviésemos á verle vivo. Corrimos sobre cubierta. El calor era tal que
la brea que unía la juntura de los tablones comenzaba á burbujar,
derritiéndose; el nauseabundo hedor de aquel sitio me ponía
verdaderamente malo, y si alguna vez hombre alguno absorbió por el
olfato los gérmenes de mil enfermedades infecciosas, ese fuí yo, sin
duda, en aquel abominable fondeadero. Los seis sabandijas estaban
sentados á proa, refunfuñando á la sombra de una vela. Hacia la playa
podíamos divisar los botes sujetos á tierra, y á un hombre de los de
Silver, sentado en cada uno de ellos. Uno de aquellos dos conjurados se
divertía silbando el "_Lilibullero_."
Esperar era una locura, así es que decidimos que Hunter y yo iríamos á
tierra en el serení[5] en busca de informes y para explorar el terreno.
Los botes se habían recargado sobre su derecha, pero Hunter y yo remamos
rectos en dirección de la estacada marcada en nuestro mapa. Los
centinelas y guardianes de los esquifes parecieron desconcertarse un
tanto con nuestra aparición. El "_Lilibullero_" cesó de oirse y pude ver
á aquel par de alhajas discutiendo lo que debían hacer. Si se hubieran
marchado para avisar á Silver lo que ocurría, abandonando sus botes, es
claro que las cosas hubieran pasado de muy distinta manera; pero supongo
que tenían sus órdenes y, en consonancia con ellas, decidieron
permanecer tranquilamente en donde estaban y muy luego oímos que la
música de "_Lilibullero_" comenzaba de nuevo.
Había en aquel punto una ligera curva en la costa y yo no perdí tiempo
remando cuan fuertemente pude para ponerla entre los hombres de los
esquifes y nosotros, de tal suerte que antes de que llegásemos á tierra
ya nos habíamos perdido mutuamente de vista. Salté por fin en la playa y
púseme á correr tan de prisa como podía atreverme á hacerlo, desplegando
sobre mi cabeza un gran pañuelo de seda blanco para evitar la insolación
y con un buen par de pistolas, enteramente listas, por precaución,
contra cualquiera sorpresa.
No había recorrido aún cien yardas cuando llegué á la estacada.
He aquí lo que había en ella: una fuente de agua límpida y clara brotaba
casi en la cumbre de la colina; sobre ésta, y encerrando la fuente por
supuesto, se había improvisado una espaciosa cabaña de postes de madera,
arreglada de manera de poder encerrar unas dos veintenas de hombres, en
caso de apuro, y con troneras para mosquetes por todos lados. Al
derredor de esta cabaña habíase limpiado un espacio considerable y, para
completar la obra, se había levantado una empalizada bastante fuerte,
como de seis pies de elevación, sin ninguna puerta ó pasadizo, con
resistencia suficiente para no poderla echar por tierra sino con tiempo
y trabajo, pero bastante abierta para que no pudiera servir de parapeto
á los sitiadores. Los que estuvieran en posesión de la cabaña del centro
podían llamarse dueños del campo y cazar á los de afuera como perdices.
Lo que se necesitaba allí era una vigilancia continua y provisiones,
porque á menos de una completa sorpresa, los sitiados podían sostenerse
muy bien contra un regimiento entero.
En lo que yo me fijé entonces de una manera más particular fué en la
fuente, porque aun cuando en nuestro castillo de popa de _La Española_
teníamos armas y municiones en gran cantidad, y abundancia de víveres y
vinos excelentes, lo cierto es que de una cosa estábamos ya bien
escasos, y era de agua. Estaba yo preocupado con este pensamiento,
cuando de pronto llegó á mis oídos distintamente, desde algún punto de
la isla, el grito supremo de un hombre que se moría. Yo he servido á Su
Alteza Real el Duque de Cumberland y aun fuí herido yo mismo en
Fontenoy, pero en aquel instante mi pulso se detuvo y no pude menos que
verme asaltado por esta idea: "_¡Han matado á Hawkins!_"
Haber sido uno un viejo soldado es ya algo, pero es todavía más haber
sido médico. No tiene uno tiempo para vacilaciones ni cosas inútiles,
así es que en un instante formé mi resolución y sin perder un segundo
regresé á la playa y salté de nuevo á bordo del serení.
Por fortuna Hunter era un remador de fuerza. Hicimos volar á nuestro
botecillo y muy pronto estábamos ya al costado de _La Española_, á cuyo
bordo subimos á toda prisa.
Encontré á todos emocionados, como era natural. El Caballero estaba
sentado, lívido como un papel, lamentando ¡alma de Dios! los peligros á
que nos había traído. Uno de los seis hombres quedados á bordo estaba ya
en mejores condiciones.
--Allí hay un hombre, dijo el Capitán Smollet apuntando hacia él, que es
novicio en la obra de estos malvados. Ha venido aquí, á punto de
desmayarse, en cuanto que oyó aquel grito de muerte. Con otra vuelta de
cabrestante lo tenemos con nosotros, eso es seguro.
Expliqué entonces al Capitán Smollet cuál era mi plan, y entre los dos
arreglamos los detalles de su realización.
Pusimos á nuestro viejo Redruth en la estrecha galería que, como se
recordará, era la única comunicación posible entre la popa y el castillo
de proa, dándole tres ó cuatro mosquetes cargados y poniéndole un
colchón por vía de barricada para protegerle. Hunter trajo el botecillo
de manera de colocarlo precisamente bajo la porta de popa y Joyce y yo
nos pusimos inmediatamente á la obra de cargar en él botes de pólvora,
mosquetes, bultos de bizcochos, galletas, jamón, una damajuana de
_cognac_ y mi inestimable estuche de cirujía.
Entre tanto el Caballero y el Capitán permanecían sobre cubierta y el
último de ellos hacía al timonel la siguiente amistosa y cortés
intimación:
--Amigo Hands, aquí nos tiene Vd. á dos personas con dos pistolas cada
una. Si alguno de Vds. seis hace el menor movimiento para acercársenos
puede tenerse por hombre al agua.
Los hombres aquellos deliberaron un corto rato y después de su pequeño
consejo de guerra se fueron dejando caer uno tras de otro, de la
_carroza_, abajo, pensando, sin duda alguna, cogernos por la
retaguardia. Pero en cuanto que se encontraron con Redruth esperándolos,
mosquete en mano, en la estrecha galería de comunicación, volvieron otra
vez á querer recobrar su lugar primitivo á proa, apareciendo sobre
cubierta la cabeza de uno de ellos por una escotilla.
--¡Abajo otra vez, perro pirata!, le gritó el Capitán, ó te vuelo la
tapa de los sesos!
La cabeza aquella se hundió de nuevo como por encanto en la escotilla y
por entonces nada volvimos á oir ni á saber de aquellos miserables.
Mientras esto pasaba, nuestro ligero serení estaba ya tan cargado como
era racional ponerlo. Joyce y yo saltamos por la porta de la popa y
tornamos á remar hacia la playa, tan de prisa como nuestras fuerzas nos
lo permitían.
Este segundo viaje despertó ya de una manera indudable la alarma de los
vigilantes de los esquifes. "_Lilibullero_" fué dado de mano otra vez, y
precisamente antes de perderlos de vista tras del pequeño cabo de la
playa, uno de ellos había ya saltado á tierra y desaparecido
rápidamente. Estuve entonces á punto de cambiar de táctica é irme
derecho á sus botes y destruírselos, pero temí que Silver estuviese por
allí demasiado cerca con los restantes y era en tal caso muy posible que
todo se perdiera por querer hacer demasiado.
Muy pronto llegamos de nuevo á tierra al mismo lugar que en el viaje
precedente. Los tres hicimos el primer trasporte del bote hasta la
cabaña, muy bien cargados, y depositamos allí nuestras armas y
provisiones. Dejamos entonces á Joyce en la palizada, de guardia para
custodiar nuestro depósito, y aunque es verdad que se quedaba solo
enteramente, tenía á su disposición media docena de mosquetes muy bien
preparados. Hunter y yo volvimos otra vez al botecillo, tornamos á
cargar lo más que pudimos y regresamos á la estacada. Así continuamos,
casi sin tomar aliento, hasta que toda la carga puesta en el bote había
sido trasladada á la cabaña en la cual los dos criados tomaron
definitivamente sus posiciones, mientras yo, con todas mis fuerzas,
remaba otra vez en el ya ligero serení hasta llegar de nuevo á _La
Española_.
El arriesgar una segunda cargada era, en realidad, menos atrevido y
peligroso de lo que parecía. Es cierto que ellos tenían la ventaja del
número, pero nosotros teníamos la de las armas. Ninguno de los hombres
que estaban en tierra llevaba un mosquete consigo y así es que, antes de
que hubieran podido acercársenos á tiro de pistola, es seguro que
nosotros hubiéramos dado buena cuenta de ellos.
El Caballero estaba espiándome en la porta de popa, ya restablecidos su
valor y su ánimo. Cogió el cabo de la amarra que yo le arrojé, lo sujetó
arriba y comenzamos á hacer ya un cargamento de verdadera vitalidad para
nosotros, consistente en carne, pólvora y bizcochos, sin añadir más
armas que un mosquete y un sable por cabeza para el Caballero, para mí,
Redruth y el Capitán. El resto de las armas y la pólvora los arrojamos
al agua á dos brazas y media de profundidad, de manera que podíamos
distinguir el limpio acero de los mosquetes brillando con los reflejos
del sol, allá abajo en el fondo limpio y arenoso del ancladero.
Á esta hora la marea comenzaba ya á bajar y el buque empezaba á
columpiarse en torno del ancla. Oímos voces llamándose mutuamente, muy
lejos y muy débiles, allá en dirección de los esquifes, y aun cuando
esto nos tranquilizó por lo que hacía á Joyce y á Hunter que, por lo
visto, quedaban todavía en su posición del Este sin ser molestados, nos
hizo comprender, sin embargo, que nosotros debíamos darnos prisa.
Redruth, entonces, abandonó su trinchera de lana en la galería y se
replegó al bote con nosotros. Dirigido el pequeño serení por el Capitán
Smollet en persona, dimos vuelta al buque y nos vinimos á colocar junto
á la escotilla de proa.
--Ahora, amigos, gritó el Capitán, ¿me oyen Vds.?
Ni una voz respondió sobre cubierta.
--¡Es á tí, Abraham Gray, á quien hablo!...
El mismo silencio anterior.
--¡Gray!, volvió á decir el Capitán en voz más alta aún, en este mismo
momento voy á dejar este buque y como tu Capitán que soy te ordeno que
me sigas. Yo sé que tú eres, en el fondo, un buen muchacho y hasta me
atrevo á decir que ninguno de los seis que están allí es tan malo como
aparenta serlo. Aquí tengo en la mano, mi reloj abierto: te doy treinta
segundos de plazo para que te me reunas.
Hubo un silencio nuevo.
--Ven pronto, muchacho mío, continuó el Capitán: no te detengas tanto en
vacilaciones. Estoy aquí exponiendo mi vida y la de estos excelentes
caballeros cada segundo que pasa.
Oyóse entonces el ruido repentino de una pendencia, el rumor de golpes
cambiados, y en unos cuantos segundos apareció Abraham Gray en la porta,
con una herida de arma blanca en una de sus mejillas, pero corriendo
presuroso á la llamada del Capitán como un perro puede venir al silbido
de su amo.
--¡Estoy con Vd. mi Capitán!, dijo aquel leal chico.
Un instante después, con Gray ya á bordo, habíamos empujado de nuevo
nuestro barquichuelo en dirección á la playa.
Y cierto es que nos encontrábamos ya fuera de la peligrosa goleta, pero
¡ay! aún no nos veíamos en tierra, dentro del recinto de la estacada.

CAPÍTULO XVII
EL DOCTOR, CONTINUANDO LA NARRACIÓN, DESCRIBE EL ÚLTIMO VIAJE DEL SERENÍ
Este quinto viaje fué ya, sin embargo, bien distinto de los precedentes.
En primer lugar aquella cascarita de nuez en que íbamos estaba demasiado
cargada. Cinco hombres, de los cuales Redruth, el Capitán y Trelawney
eran de más de seis pies de altura, era más de lo que nuestro botecillo
podía racional y cómodamente cargar. Añádase á esto la pólvora, las
armas y las provisiones de boca, y se comprenderá que el serení se
balancease de una manera inquietante, alojando agua de cuando en cuando,
por la popa, á un grado tal, que todavía no habíamos andado cien yardas
y ya una buena parte de mis vestidos estaba mojada hasta no poderse más.
Hízonos el Capitán que aparejásemos el bote compartiendo el peso más
proporcionalmente, lo que nos apresuramos á ejecutar, consiguiendo
equilibrarlo un poco mejor. Pero aun así no dejábamos de sentirnos con
el temor, no del todo infundado, de zozabrar.
En segundo lugar, el reflujo producía, á la sazón, una fuerte corriente
de olas en dirección poniente, atravesando la rada y moviéndose en
seguida hacia el sur, en dirección del mar, por el estrecho que nos
había franqueado el paso en la mañana hasta el ancladero. Las olas, de
por sí, eran ya un peligro para nuestro sobrecargado esquife, pero lo
peor de todo era que la dicha corriente nos arrastraba fuera de nuestra
vía, y lejos del lugar de la playa en que teníamos que desembarcar, tras
de la punta de que ya he hablado. Si permitíamos á la corriente realizar
su obra, el resultado iba á ser que antes de mucho nos encontrásemos en
tierra, es verdad, pero precisamente al lado de los esquifes de los
piratas, que quizás no tardarían mucho en presentarse.
--Me es imposible enderezar el rumbo hacia la estacada, Capitán, dije yo
que iba sentado al timón, en tanto que él y Redruth que estaban de
refresco, llevaban los remos. La marea nos arroja constantemente hacia
abajo; ¿no podrían Vds. remar un poco más fuerte?
--No sin echar el bote á pique, contestó. Sostenga Vd. el gobernalle
inmóvil hasta que vea Vd. que vamos ganando la vía.
Hice lo que se me indicaba y pronto ví que, si bien la marea continuaba
empujándonos hacia el poniente, muy luego logramos que el bote
enderezara la proa al Este siguiendo una línea que marcaba precisamente
un ángulo recto con el camino que debíamos tomar.
--De esta manera no vamos á tocar tierra jamás, dije yo.
--Si no nos queda otro derroterro libre más que éste, no podemos hacer
otra cosa que seguirlo á todo azar, contestó el Capitán. Tenemos que ir
contra la corriente de la bajamar. Ya ve Vd., pues, que si seguíamos
bordeando á sotavento de nuestro desembarcadero era muy difícil decir á
donde íbamos á tocar tierra; esto sin contar con la inmediata
probabilidad de ser abordados por los botes de Silver, en tanto que, por
el camino en que nos hemos puesto, la corriente puede amortiguarse
pronto y entonces ya podremos virar rectamente hacia la playa.
--La corriente ha amainado ya mucho, señor, díjome Gray que iba sentado
hacia proa. Ya puede Vd. hacer que viremos de bordo un poco.
--Gracias, muchacho, le contesté como si nada hubiera sucedido, puesto
que todos habíamos hecho tácitamente la resolución de tratarlo desde
luego como á uno de los nuestros.
De repente el Capitán habló de nuevo y noté que había una perceptible
alteración en su voz.
--¿Y el cañón?, dijo.
--Ya pensaba en eso, le respondí seguro como estaba de que él se refería
á la posibilidad de que se bombardeara nuestro reducto. No crea Vd. que
les sea posible bajar el cañón á tierra, y aun en el supuesto de que lo
consiguieran, jamás podrían hacerlo subir por entre el monte.
--Pues mire Vd. á popa, Doctor, replicó el Capitán.
Volví la cabeza... Lo cierto es que habíamos echado completamente en
olvido nuestra pieza de artillería en la goleta y de allí nuestro horror
cuando oímos que los cinco bandidos estaban muy atareados, despojándola
de lo que ellos llamaban _la chaqueta_, ó sea el abrigo de grueso cáñamo
embreado con que la manteníamos envuelta durante la navegación. No era
esto todo, sino que al punto me acordé que las balas y la pólvora de la
misma pieza habíanse quedado á bordo en un cajón, por lo cual no
necesitaban nuestros enemigos sino dar un golpe con una hachuela para
ser dueños de aquellas terribles municiones de guerra.
Aquel olvido no podía tener más disculpa que la prisa con que nos vimos
precisados á evacuar la embarcación, pero desgraciadamente era
irremediable.
--Israel Hands era el artillero de Flint, dijo Gray con voz ronca.
No me quedaba, pues, otro recurso que, á cualquier riesgo, poner
decididamente proa á tierra. Á esta sazón, por fortuna nuestra, la
corriente quedaba ya tan lejos de nosotros que nos fué fácil seguir
rumbo á la playa por un camino tan recto como nuestra quilla, á pesar
del impulso necesariamente poco vigoroso que los remos imprimían á
nuestro bote. Ya no me fué difícil, pues, gobernar derechamente hacia la
meta. Pero lo muy malo era que en la dirección que íbamos no
presentábamos á _La Española_ nuestra popa, sino un costado, ofreciendo
á su tiro un blanco de tal tamaño que parecía imposible que se le errara
puntería.
Érame fácil ver y oir á aquel bribón de Hands con su cara de borracho
consuetudinario, arreglando sobre cubierta un cartucho para el cañón.
--¿Quién es aquí el mejor tirador?, preguntó el Capitán.
--El Sr. de Trelawney, aquí y donde quiera, le contesté.
--Pues bien, Sr. de Trelawney, ¿quiere Vd. hacerme el favor de quitarme
de en medio á uno de aquellos pícaros? Á Hands, de preferencia, si es
posible, dijo el Capitán.
Trelawney estaba frío como el acero; sin decir palabra preparó su arma.
--Ahora, díjonos el Capitán, mucho cuidado. Dispare Vd. su arma sin
hacer movimiento alguno ó de lo contrario nos vamos á pique. ¡Todo el
mundo listo para equilibrar, si el bote zozobra al disparo!
El Caballero levantó su arma y los remos cesaron de hender el agua:
todos nos inclinamos del lado contrario para mantener el equilibrio y
todo fué ejecutado con tal felicidad que no hicimos entrar al bote ni
una sola gota de líquido.
En este instante nuestros enemigos tenían ya su pieza montada y lista, y
Hands, que estaba junto á la boca, con el escobillón en la mano, era el
más expuesto de todos. Sin embargo, no tuvimos fortuna, pues
precisamente en el momento en que, ya seguro de su puntería, disparó
Trelawney, el astuto timonel se encorvó rápido como el pensamiento y la
bala que pasó silbando por encima de él, fué á herir á otro de los
cuatro piratas que cayó al punto.
El grito que este lanzó fué repetido no sólo por sus compañeros de al
lado sino por otras muchas voces desde la playa. Volví la vista en esta
dirección y noté que todos los demás piratas salían de entre los árboles
en aquel momento y se apresuraban á ocupar sus lugares en los esquifes.
--Ahora vienen allí los botes, señores, dije.
--Enfile Vd., pues, recto, gritó el Capitán. Ahora ya no hay miedo de
zozobrar; ¡firme á los remos! Si no podemos llegar á tierra, todo ha
concluído para nosotros.
--No han tripulado más que uno de los botes, Capitán, añadí. Los hombres
del otro van probablemente por tierra á cortarnos el paso.
--El calor es excesivo y la distancia no es tan corta para que lo
consigan fácilmente, replicó el Capitán. Marinos en tierra no son muy
temibles. Lo que me preocupa es el tiro que nos van á largar de á bordo.
¡Rayos y truenos! nuestro flanco es tal que una beata podía pasarnos la
bala por ojo, sin errarnos. Sr. de Trelawney, avísenos Vd. en cuanto vea
encender el estopón, y nosotros remaremos á popa.
En el entretanto habíamos caminado de frente á un paso que era harto
veloz para un esquife tan cargado como nuestro serení, y muy poca agua
por cierto nos había entrado. Ya estábamos á pocas brazas de la orilla;
unas cuantas remadas más y podríamos atracar al fin, porque el reflujo
acababa de descubrir una cinta de arena, abajo de un grupo de árboles de
los de la costa. El esquife que nos daba caza ya no podía, pues,
hacernos daño alguno; el reflujo que tanto nos había detenido á
nosotros, estaba dándonos la compensación deteniendo ahora á nuestros
perseguidores. El único peligro estaba para nosotros en el cañón.
--Si me atreviese, dijo el Capitán, de buena gana haríamos alto para
cazar á otro de esos bandidos.
Era claro, sin embargo, que ellos en todo pensaban menos en dilatar su
tiro por más tiempo. Ni siquiera habían hecho el menor caso de su
camarada caído, que, sin embargo, no estaba muerto sino simplemente
herido y al cual yo miraba, tratando de arrastrarse á un lado.
--¡El estopón!, gritó el Caballero.
--¡Empuje á popa!, gritó el Capitán rápido como un eco.
Él y Redruth dieron en el acto un contraimpulso, pero tan vigoroso que
la popa del serení se hundió toda dentro del agua. En el mismo instante
el cañón tronó, y su detonación fué lo primero que Jim oyó, no habiendo
llegado hasta él, por la distancia, el rumor del disparo de Trelawney.
Por dónde pasó la bala, ninguno de nosotros lo supo precisamente, pero
supongo que debe haber sido por encima de nuestras cabezas y que el
viento de ella debe haber contribuído á nuestro desastre.
Nuestro bote se había hundido por la popa, como he dicho, con la mayor
facilidad, en una profundidad de tres pies de agua, dejándonos al
Capitán y á mí, de pie el uno frente al otro, en tanto que los tres
restantes que se habían inclinado para evitar en lo posible la bala del
pedrero, salían del agua empapados y escurriendo de la cabeza á los
pies.
Con todo y esto el daño no era tan grande. No había perecido ninguno de
nosotros y ya de allí podíamos caminar á pie por el agua, las pocas
brazas que nos separaban de la playa. Lo malo era que nuestras
provisiones estaban en el fondo del esquife y que de los cinco mosquetes
que habíamos puesto en él, sólo dos quedaban secos y servibles: el mío
que yo había cogido de sobre mis rodillas y levantándolo en alto con un
movimiento rápido é instintivo; y el del Capitán que lo llevaba puesto
en bandolera y que, en su calidad de hombre experto, había cuidado su
arma de toda preferencia. Los restantes yacían ya bajo el agua con el
bote.
Como complemento de nuestra tribulación oímos voces que se acercaban
entre el bosque, á lo largo de la playa. Así es que no sólo sentíamos ya
encima el peligro de quedar cortados de nuestro reducto, en aquel estado
de semicatástrofe y derrota, sino que nos aguijoneaba el temor de que,
si Hunter y Joyce se veían atacados por una media docena de hombres, no
tuviesen el valor y el buen sentido de mantenerse firmes á la defensiva.
Hunter era un hombre de firmeza y corazón: esto lo sabíamos bien; pero
en cuanto á Joyce el caso era bien diferente, y bastante dudoso. Joyce
era un lacayo muy agradable, de muy finas maneras, y excelente para
limpiar un par de botas ó cepillar un vestido, pero la verdad es que no
le conocíamos tamaños de hombre de armas tomar.
Todo esto, como llevo dicho, nos aguijoneó para llegar á tierra enjuta
tan pronto como era posible, dejando abandonado á su suerte al pobre
serení que, para desgracia nuestra, había guardado en su fondo algo como
la mitad de nuestra pólvora y provisiones de boca.

CAPÍTULO XVIII
EN QUE CUENTA EL DOCTOR CÓMO CONCLUYÓ EL PRIMER DÍA DE PELEA
Una vez en tierra, dímonos toda la prisa que era posible para franquear
la tierra de bosque que nos separaba de nuestro baluarte. Á cada paso
que dábamos, las voces de los piratas que venían por la playa llegaban
más y más distintas á nuestros oídos. Muy pronto ya nos fué fácil
distinguir el rumor de sus precipitados pasos, y el crujido de las ramas
de los arbustos á través de cuyos matorrales se venían abriendo camino.
Comencé á creer entonces que la cosa iba de veras y hasta requerí el
fiador de mi mosquete.
Capitán, dije: el Sr. de Trelawney es el de puntería infalible entre
nosotros; déle Vd. su mosquete, porque el suyo está inutilizado.
Sin responderme cambiaron rápidamente de armas y Trelawney, callado y
frío como había estado desde el principio de la batalla, se detuvo por
un instante para cerciorarse de que el arma estaba en buen estado para
servicio inmediato. En el mismo momento, notando que Gray iba desarmado,
le alargué mi cuchillo. Mucho nos animó el ver á aquel chico escupirse
la mano, remangarse la camisa, empuñar el arma y hacerla zumbar,
blandiéndola por el aire. Era cosa que se veía desde luego que aquel
nuestro nuevo aliado era todo un marino de pelo en pecho.
Á unos cuarenta pasos de aquella rápida detención llegamos al lindero
del bosque y vimos la estacada frente á nosotros. Nos lanzamos á ella,
entrando á su recinto por el lado sur, cuya empalizada salvamos rápidos
como el rayo, y casi en el instante mismo siete de los amotinados, con
Job Ánderson el contramaestre á la cabeza, aparecieron en el lado
Sudoeste lanzando gritos tremendos.
Detuviéronse un momento al llegar allí, como si se sintieran cogidos por
retaguardia, pero antes de que ellos tuvieran tiempo de recobrarse de su
sorpresa, no sólo Trelawney y yo, sino también Hunter y Joyce tuvimos
tiempo de hacer fuego desde el reducto. Los cuatro tiros no sonaron en
una descarga muy simultánea, pero hicieron su efecto, eso sí. Uno de los
enemigos cayó redondo y los restantes, sin vacilar más tiempo, volvieron
la espalda y se parapetaron tras de los árboles.
Después de cargar de nuevo nuestras armas, salimos afuera de la
empalizada para reconocer al enemigo que había caído. Estaba muerto y
muy bien muerto, con el corazón atravesado de parte á parte.
Ya comenzábamos á felicitarnos de nuestra buena suerte cuando en aquel
mismo instante una detonación de pistola se dejó oir en el matorral más
cercano; la bala silbó junto á mi oído y el pobre de Tom Redruth se
tambaleó y cayó en el suelo de largo á largo. Tanto el Caballero como yo
devolvimos el tiro, pero como no teníamos sobre qué hacer puntería,
es muy probable que no hicimos más que desperdiciar nuestra pólvora.
Cargamos otra vez y entonces volvímonos á ver al pobre Tom.
[Illustration: MUERTE DE REDRUTH.]
El Capitán y Gray estaban ya examinándolo, y en cuanto á mí me bastó la
primera ojeada para comprender que aquello no tenía remedio.
Creo que la prontitud con que respondimos á su disparo dispersó á los
rebeldes una vez más, porque aunque estábamos á descubierto ya no se nos
hostilizó mientras nos dábamos trazas de izar al pobre guarda-monte para
pasarlo al recinto de la estacada y trasladarlo, quejándose y
desangrándose, al interior de la cabaña.
¡Pobre viejo! De sus labios no había salido ni una palabra de sorpresa,
queja ó temor, pero ni aun de sentimiento, desde el instante en que
habían comenzado nuestras complicaciones, hasta aquel punto en que le
acostábamos allí, en el centro de nuestro reducto, para que muriera.
Como un troyano verdadero había permanecido vigilante é inmóvil tras de
su colchón en la galería; cuantas órdenes se le habían dado, él las
había obedecido callado, con la docilidad de un perro, y muy bien, por
cierto. Era el de más edad de todos los de nuestro campo, llevando
veinte años, por lo menos, al más viejo; y ahora, aquel anciano criado
taciturno, servicial, estaba allí tendido, próximo al sepulcro.
El Caballero se dejó caer casi junto á él, sobre sus rodillas, y le
besaba la mano, llorando como un chiquillo.
--¿Cree Vd. que me voy, Doctor?, preguntó el moribundo.
--Tom, hijo mío, le contesté, vas á volver á tu verdadera patria.
--Siento mucho, replicó el agonizante, no haber dado antes á esos pillos
una lección con mi mosquete.
--Tom, exclamó á la sazón el Caballero todo conmovido; Tom, dime que me
perdonas, ¿no es verdad que si?
--Señor, fué su respuesta, ¿no crée Vd. que eso parecería una falta de
respeto de mí á Vd.? Pero hágase como Vd. lo pide... sí señor, con toda
mi alma.
Siguióse un silencio no muy largo al cabo del cual murmuró que desearía
que alguien dijese cerca de su cabecera alguna oración, añadiendo en
tono sencillo y como disculpándose de su atrevimiento.
--Créo que esa es la costumbre... ¿no es verdad?
Vino luego una agonía muy corta; y sin pronunciar ninguna otra palabra,
el alma de Redruth partió de este mundo.
Entre tanto el Capitán, cuyas faltriqueras y pecho había yo visto en
extremo abultados durante la travesía, fué sacando de ellos todo un
almacén de objetos: una bandera inglesa, una Biblia, una adujada ó lío
de cuerda bastante fuerte, plumas, tinta, el registro diario de á bordo
y algunas libras de tabaco. Habíase encontrado en nuestro recinto de la
estacada un largo y ya aderezado tronco de abeto que, con la ayuda de
Hunter, levantó y puso en el ángulo de la cabaña en que los troncos se
cruzaban. Acto continuo, subiendo ágilmente sobre el techo del reducto,
colocó con su propia mano é izó en alto la bandera de nuestra patria.
Esta operación pareció como aliviarle de un gran peso. Volvió á entrar
en seguida á la cabaña y como si nada hubiera de particular se puso
tranquilamente á hacer el recuento de nuestras provisiones de guerra y
boca. Pero no dejaba, sin embargo, de mirar con disimulo del lado del
pobre de Tom Redruth que estaba agonizando, y así es que, no bien hubo
éste espirado, cuando se acercó con otra bandera y la desplegó
reverentemente sobre el cadáver. En seguida, sacudiendo virilmente la
mano del Caballero, le dijo:
--No hay que afligirse, señor. Todo temor es vano tratándose del alma de
un leal, que ha sucumbido cumpliendo con su deber para con su Capitán y
con su señor. Sería una ofensa á la Divinidad el creer otra cosa.
Dicho esto me llevó á un lado y me dijo:
--¿Dentro de cuántas semanas esperan Vd. y el Caballero que vendrá el
buque que ha de enviar Blandy?
--No es cuestión de semanas, sino de meses, le contesté. En caso de que
no estemos de vuelta para el fin de Agosto, Blandy mandará buscarnos,
pero ni antes ni después de ese tiempo. Vd. puede calcular por sí mismo.
--Yo lo creo que sí, contestó rascándose la cabeza de un modo muy
significativo. Así es que, no sin dar á la Providencia una _buena
ración_ de gracias por todos sus beneficios, debo decir que no por eso
hemos estado menos desafortunados.
--¿Qué quiere Vd. decir con eso?, le pregunté.
--Quiero decir, me respondió, que es una lástima que hayamos perdido
aquel segundo cargamento del botecillo. Por lo que hace á pólvora y
balas, tenemos bastantes; pero, en cuanto á provisiones de boca, estamos
escasos, muy escasos; tan escasos, Doctor, que quizás nos viene muy bien
el tener aquella boca de menos.
Y al decir esto señalaba el cadáver que yacía cubierto con la bandera
inglesa por sudario.
En aquel mismo instante oyóse el trueno y el silbido de una bala de
cañón que pasó rozando el techo de nuestro reducto y fué á enterrarse
entre los árboles del bosque.
--¡Ajá!, dijo el Capitán. ¡Salvas tenemos! Bastante poca pólvora tienen
esos chicos para que la desperdicien así tan locamente.
Otro segundo disparo arrojó su bala con mejor puntería, pues el
proyectil penetró adentro de la estacada, levantando una nube de arena,
pero sin causarnos el menor daño.
--Capitán, dijo el Caballero; me consta que nuestro reducto, de por sí,
es enteramente invisible desde el buque. Creo, por tanto, que es la
bandera la que les está sirviendo para hacer blanco... ¿no cree Vd. que
sería más prudente traerla acá adentro?
--¿Arriar mi pabellón? ¡Jamás!, exclamó el Capitán.
Nosotros fuimos todos inmediatamente de su misma opinión, porque aquello
no sólo tenía un aspecto marcial, marino é imponente, sino que entrañaba
una buena política, cual era la de mostrar á nuestros enemigos que no se
nos daba un ardite de su cañoneo.
Toda la tarde continuaron su fuego. Bala tras de bala venía; las unas
pasaban por encima del techo, otras caían á un lado, otras entraban al
recinto de la empalizada, desparpajando la arena del piso. Pero como
tenían que hacer su puntería sobre una mira muy alta sus tiros no
lograron más que encontrar sepultura en la leve arena de la loma. No
teníamos rebotes que temer y aunque una bala penetró á la cabaña por el
techo y luego salió de nuevo por un costado, muy pronto nos
acostumbramos á esa especie de broma pesada y no hicimos más caso de
ella que lo habríamos hecho de una partida de vilorta.
--Me ocurre una buena idea, dijo el Capitán. El bosque frente á nosotros
está bastante claro; la marea ha dejado un buen espacio en seco y á la
hora de ésta nuestras provisiones están ya probablemente en descubierto.
Creo que si algunos de los nuestros se prestaran á hacer una pequeña
salida con ese objeto, podríamos recobrar parte de nuestra carne salada.
Gray y Hunter se ofrecieron desde luego, y, muy bien armados, salvaron
la empalizada. Su misión fué, sin embargo, inútil. Los rebeldes eran más
intrépidos de lo que creíamos, ó tenían más fe de la que se merecía en
su artillero Hands, porque el hecho es que ya cinco ó seis de ellos
estaban muy ocupados sacando nuestras provisiones del fondo del serení y
trasladándolas á uno de sus esquifes que estaba allí cerca, mantenido
contra la corriente por el manejo constante de un remo. Silver estaba en
la popa al mando de las operaciones, y cada uno de sus hombres aparecía
ya provisto de su mosquete correspondiente, tomado de algún oculto
arsenal de ellos mismos.
El Capitán se sentó para escribir en su diario de á bordo, y he aquí el
principio de lo que trazó en él:
"Alejandro Smollet, Capitán; David Livesey, médico de á bordo; Abraham
Gray, carpintero de la goleta; John Trelawney, propietario; John Hunter
y Ricardo Joyce, criados del propietario, que no son marinos; estos son
los que se conservan leales de toda la gente embarcada á bordo de _La
Española_; tenemos víveres para diez días á raciones cortas; hemos
desembarcado hoy é izado luego la bandera inglesa en la estacada ó
reducto que hemos hallado en esta Isla del Tesoro. Tom Redruth, otro
sirviente del propietario, ha sido muerto por los rebeldes. James
Hawkins, paje de cámara..."
En este momento yo estaba lamentándome acerca de la triste suerte y fin
desastroso del pobre Hawkins, cuando oímos algunos gritos y llamadas del
lado de tierra.
--Alguien nos vocea por acá, díjonos Hunter que estaba de centinela.
--¡Doctor! ¡Caballero!... ¡Capitán!... ¡Hola! ¿eres tú Hunter?, decían
los gritos aquellos.
Corrí á la puerta de la cabaña y llegué á tiempo para ver de nuevo, sano
y salvo, á Jim Hawkins, salvando en aquel momento la empalizada.

CAPÍTULO XIX
EL NARRADOR PRIMERO TOMA OTRA VEZ LA PALABRA--LA GUARNICIÓN DE LA
ESTACADA
No bien Ben Gunn hubo visto la bandera, hizo alto inmediatamente, me
tomó por el brazo para detenerme y se sentó.
--¡Ah! lo que es por ahora, Jim, allí están tus amigos, con toda
seguridad.
--Mas bien creo que sean los rebeldes, le repliqué.
--¡Ca, no!, dijo él. ¿Crees tú que en un lugar como este, al cual no
abordan sino piratas, había de venir Silver á enarbolar el pabellón
inglés? ¡Ni por pienso! Son tus amigos, Jim, no tengas la menor duda.
Además, ya ha habido pelea y me sospecho que los tuyos han llevado la
mejor parte y ahora los tienes instalados en esa estacada y reducto que
fué construído hace años y años por el Capitán Flint. ¡Ah! puedes creer
que el tal Capitán era hombre que sabía lo que traía entre manos.
Quitándole lo borracho, era persona que jamás dejaba traslucir su juego.
No le tenía miedo á nadie... á nadie más que á Silver. Silver puede
jactarse de ello.
--Bueno, pues siendo esto así, como creo que lo es, tanta más razón
para que yo me apresure á reunirme con mis amigos.
--Como tu quieras, replicó él. Tú eres un buen muchacho, ó yo me
equivoco, pero muchacho nada más y con eso está dicho todo. En cuanto á
Ben Gunn, éste se escapa. Ni un vaso de rom podría seducirme bastante
para ir allá, ni el mismo rom, ¡no!, hasta que no vea yo á tu Caballero
de nacimiento y le entregué eso bajo su palabra de honor. Pero no
olvides mis palabras... "_el precioso don de su confianza_," esto es lo
que tú debes decirle "_el precioso don de su confianza_..." y al decirle
esto le das el pellizco que ya sabes.
Y añadiendo la acción á la palabra, me largó por tercera vez un
pellizco, con el mismo aire de confianza íntima que los anteriores.
--Así pues, cuando necesiten á Ben Gunn, ya sabes en donde encontrarle,
Jim: precisamente en el mismo lugar en que me has visto hoy. El que vaya
en mi busca que lleve en la mano, por señal, algún lienzo blanco, y que
vaya solo, enteramente solo. Para esto, añadirás, Ben Gunn tiene sus
buenas razones muy particulares.
--Está bien, le dije; creo haber entendido. Vd. tiene algo que proponer
y desea Vd. ver, bien al Caballero ó bien al Doctor, para lo cual se le
puede encontrar á Vd. en el mismo lugar en que hoy le he hallado, ¿es
esto todo?
--¿Á qué horas? ¿Quieres saber también á qué horas, no es verdad? Pues
estaré allí diariamente desde el mediodía hasta las seis de la tarde.
--Entendidos, le contesté, ahora ¿no cree Vd. que ya debemos
despedirnos?
--Sí; pero mira... cuidado con olvidar las palabras esas: "_el precioso
don de su confianza_" y las otras de "_sus buenas razones muy
particulares_." Mira que esto es de lo muy esencial... "_razones muy
particulares_," ¿eh? ¡como de hombre á hombre!
Y sin soltarme el brazo todavía, añadió:
--Creo que ya puedes marcharte, Jim... Pero óyeme... si por desgracia te
fueres á tropezar ahora con Silver, ¿no es verdad que ni con caballos
brutos te arrancará la confesión de lo que te he dicho?... ¿Verdad que
no?... ¡Ah! ¡bueno!... Pero, y si los piratas acampan esta noche en
tierra, Jim ¿no podremos esperar que para mañana estén ya un poco menos
salvajes?...
Al llegar aquí fué interrumpido por una fuerte detonación, y una bala
del pedrero de á bordo vino rebotando entre los árboles y se enterró en
la arena á menos de cien yardas de donde estábamos hablando. Sin esperar
á más, fué aquella como la señal de nuestra despedida y cada uno de
nosotros echó á correr, en dirección opuesta.
Por el espacio de cerca de una hora, frecuentes disparos continuaron
haciendo estremecer la isla, y las balas siguieron rompiendo y
astillando los árboles del bosque. Yo me iba acercando de escondite en
escondite, para evitar aquella especie de persecución de terríficos
proyectiles; pero como hacia el fin del bombardeo, aunque todavía no
osaba aventurarme á entrar abiertamente en la estacada, en cuyo recinto
veía yo que caían las balas con más frecuencia, ya había comenzado á
cobrar más ánimo, y después de un considerable rodeo hacia el Este,
logré deslizarme entre los árboles de la playa y me tendí allí en
observación.
El sol acababa de ponerse; la brisa del mar crujía y revoloteaba entre
los ramajes del bosque, encrespando la parda superficie del agua del
fondeadero. El reflejo iba ya muy lejos y grandes porciones de playa
aparecían descubiertas. El aire, después del terrible calor del día, era
más que fresco y yo sentía que me escalofriaba á través de mi jubón.
_La Española_ permanecía aun al ancla en el mismo lugar en que habíamos
fondeado en la mañana; solamente que en el tope de su palo mayor no
flameaba ya, por cierto, la bandera de la Unión Británica, sino la
enseña siniestra de los piratas. Desde mi escondite pude ver una nueva
luz relampaguear á bordo, y oí una nueva detonación, al par que otra
bala zumbaba por el viento, mientras los ecos repetían aun el trueno del
disparo. Aquel fué, sin embargo, el último del cañoneo.
Permanecí todavía por cierto tiempo en mi punto de observación, dándome
cuenta de la baraúnda y el alboroto que siguieron al ataque. Algunos de
los piratas se ocupaban en despedazar con hachas algo que estaba en la
playa, no lejos de la estacada: era nada menos que el pobre serení,
según descubrí después. Allá más lejos, cerca de la desembocadura del
riachuelo se veía el resplandor de un buen fuego brillando entre la
arboleda, y entre aquel punto y el buque, uno de los esquifes andaba
yendo y viniendo, con sus remeros á quienes poco antes había visto yo
hoscos y amenazadores, cantando ahora y silbando como chiquillos, si
bien es verdad que sus voces tenían un acento que denunciaba el rom
desde á legua.
Pensé, al cabo, que ya podía y debía efectuar mi vuelta á la estacada.
Habíame colocado muy abajo en la punta arenosa que encerraba el
ancladero hacia el Este y que se halla unida á la Isla del Esqueleto
por una cinta de agua de poquísima profundidad. Al ponerme en pie, mis
ojos tropezaron á alguna distancia, allá abajo de la punta, con una roca
aislada, que se alzaba bastante alta entre los matorrales y que
presentaba un notable color blanco. Me ocurrió al punto que aquella
debía ser la _Peña blanca_ de que me había hablado Ben Gunn, y que, si
un día ú otro necesitábamos de un bote, era ya una ventaja saber á donde
podíamos acudir á buscarlo.
Me escurrí luego entre el bosque hasta ganar otra vez la espalda de
nuestro baluarte; lo escalé, entré y fuí cordialmente saludado por aquel
grupo de leales y valientes.
Pronto concluí de contarles mi aventura y comencé á ver en torno mío,
para darme cuenta de nuestra posición. El reducto estaba construído con
troncos de pino, sin cuadrar, así el techo como los muros y el piso.
Este último se elevaba, en algunos lugares, á un pie ó pie y medio sobre
la superficie de la arena. En la puerta se había formado un portalillo ó
vestíbulo, bajo el cual la fuente brotaba, arrojando sus cristalinas
aguas en un tazón artificial de bien extraña ralea, que no era otra cosa
que un gran caldero de hierro tomado de algún navío, con el fondo
arrancado, é incrustado allí en la arena.
Bien poca cosa había en aquel recinto, á excepción de la obra misma de
la casa; en un rincón una gran piedra lisa, colocada allí para servir de
fogón ó brasero, y un tosco cesto de hierro para contener el fuego y
ponerse sobre la piedra.
Los declives de la loma y todo el interior de la empalizada habían sido
limpiados de árboles que habían servido para la construcción de la casa
y de la estacada exterior. Por los troncos, que aun sobresalían de la
tierra, podía verse qué soberbio boscaje se había derribado en gracia de
la erección de aquel reducto. Todos los desechos y ramas habían sido
arrojados lejos ó enterrados en algún vallado, después de la traslación
de los maderos. La única verdura que quedaba allí era un lecho de musgo
por donde corrían los derrames de la fuente que se escapaban fuera de su
tosco tazón de hierro, y á un lado y otro de la corriente algunos
helechos, zarzas rastreras y matas pequeñitas, surgiendo penosamente de
entre la arena. Muy cerca de la estacada--demasiado cerca para que
sirviese de defensa, según oí decir--el bosque se extendía aun denso y
elevado, todo de abetos, por el lado de tierra, y mezclado con una gran
cantidad de árboles de la vida por el lado del mar.
La brisa fría de la noche de que antes he hablado, silbaba en cada una
de las aberturas del rústico y primitivo edificio y hacía caer sobre el
piso una continua lluvia de menudísima arena. Teníamos arena en los
ojos, arena en los dientes, arena en los oídos, arena en nuestra cena y
arena revoloteando en el desfondado caldero de la fuentecilla que
parecía una gran olla, á punto de hervir. Nuestra chimenea se limitaba á
un agujero cuadrado en el techo, y sólo una muy pequeña parte del humo
acertaba á escaparse por allí, en tanto que todo el resto se quedaba
revoloteando por la pieza, haciéndonos toser de lo lindo y obligándonos
á enjugarnos á cada instante los llorosos lagrimales.
Añádase á esto que Gray, nuestro nuevo aliado, tenía la cara casi
cubierta con un gran vendaje á causa de una herida que había recibido en
el buque al desprenderse de los amotinados; y que el pobre Redruth aun
estaba allí insepulto, rígido y frío, á lo largo del muro, y cubierto
con la bandera nacional.
Si se nos hubiera permitido sentarnos á descansar, es claro que todos lo
habríamos hecho á pierna tirante; pero el Capitán Smollet no era hombre
para eso. Todos fuimos llamados á su presencia y divididos en diversas
facciones: el Doctor, Gray y yo para una; el Caballero, Hunter y Joyce
para otra. Cansados como estábamos se ordenó á dos de nosotros que
fueran por leña, otros dos á arreglar como mejor se pudiera una fosa
para sepultar á Redruth; el Doctor fué nombrado cocinero; á mí se me
puso de centinela á la puerta de la cabaña y el Capitán se empleó en
andar de uno á otro levantando nuestros ánimos y prestando su ayuda
material en donde quiera que se la necesitaba.
De vez en cuando el Doctor salía un momento á la puerta separándose de
su cocina para tomar un poco de aire fresco y dejar descansar algo sus
ojos que ya parecían querer salírsele de las órbitas á causa del humo, y
cada vez que venía á mi sitio de guardia me dirigía algunas palabras. En
una de sus salidas me dijo:
--Ese hombre Smollet vale mucho más que yo. Y mira, Jim, que el decir yo
eso significa mucho.
En otra ocasión vino y se estuvo callado por un corto rato. Luego volvió
la cabeza y me preguntó:
--Dime, Jim, ¿ese Ben Gunn es de veras un hombre?
--No podré decirlo á Vd., señor, le contesté. Por lo menos dudo mucho
que esté en su juicio.
--Bueno, si es posible la duda, entonces es seguro que sí está, replicó
el Doctor. Ya tú comprendes, Jim, que un hombre que durante tres años
se ha estado solo en una isla desierta no puede conservar su razón tan
cabal como tú ó yo. Eso no es posible dentro de la naturaleza humana.
¿Dices que lo que á él parecía urgirle más era comer un pedazo de queso?
--Queso, sí señor, le contesté.
--Está bien; pues mira tú ahora lo que es venir uno sobrenadando en la
abundancia. ¿Has visto mi caja de rapé, no es verdad? Y nunca me habrás
visto tomar un polvo: la razón es que en esa cajilla lo que traigo
precisamente es un pedazo de queso de Parma, un queso hecho en Italia, y
extraordinariamente nutritivo. Pues bueno: ese queso es ahora para Ben
Gunn.
Antes de que nos pusiéramos á cenar, dimos sepultura al cadáver del
viejo Tom en una fosa cavada en la arena, en torno de la cual
permanecimos piadosamente por algún rato tristes y preocupados, con las
cabezas, que la brisa de la noche enfriaba, descubiertas en aquel acto
solemne.
Buen acopio de leña se había llevado al interior de la cabaña, pero no
toda la que el Capitán deseaba, por lo cual, una vez que la hubo
inspeccionado nos dijo que esperaba que por la mañana se recomenzara la
obra y con una poca de mayor diligencia por esta vez. Cuando todos
hubimos tomado nuestras respectivas raciones de tocino y apurado un buen
jarro de _grog de Cognac_, los tres jefes se retiraron á un ángulo de la
pieza á deliberar sobre la situación.
Muy bien veíamos que habían agotado su imaginación para resolver qué
haríamos, siendo como eran tan escasas nuestras provisiones, que al fin
nos veríamos obligados á rendirnos mucho antes de que pudiese llegarnos
ni una sombra de socorro. Así, pues, se decidió que nuestra mejor
esperanza era la de procurar matar cuantos piratas pudiéramos hasta
obligarlos, á una de dos, ó á arriar bandera, ó á largarse al fin con
_La Española_. De diez y nueve que ellos eran ya se veían ahora
reducidos á quince, habiendo dos heridos, y por lo menos uno de ellos,
el que cayó junto al cañón, de gravedad. Cada vez que tuviésemos
batalla, debíamos aprovechar bien nuestra pólvora con gran cuidado de no
exponer inútilmente nuestras vidas. Teníamos, además, dos magníficos
aliados: el rom y el clima.
Por lo que hace al rom, aunque estábamos á más de media milla distantes
del enemigo podíamos oir su barahunda y sus cánticos que duraron hasta
bien entrada la noche.
Y en cuanto al clima, el Doctor apostaba su peluca á que, anclados en
donde estaban, cerca ó casi en medio del pantano, sin remedios
disponibles, por lo menos una media docena de ellos estarían tendidos
con fiebre antes de una semana.
--Por tanto, añadió, si no nos matan á todos nosotros de una vez, ya se
darán de santos con empacarse en el buque y marcharse con viento fresco
á piratear de nuevo por esos mares de Dios, que al fin y al cabo, buque
es nuestra goleta que puede servirles para su objeto.
--Será el primer navío que haya yo perdido en mi vida, dijo el Capitán
Smollet.
Yo me sentía cansado hasta la muerte, como es fácil figurárselo, así es
que en cuanto se me dejó tenderme á dormir, lo cual no sucedió sino
después de mucho molestarme, caí en un sueño tan pesado que entre un
tronco y yo no había la menor diferencia.
Todos los demás estaban ya levantados mucho tiempo hacía; ya habían
almorzado y traído casi doble cantidad de leña que la acarreada la
víspera, cuando me desperté con una baraúnda repentina y un rumor
desusado de voces.
--¡Bandera de paz!, oí que decía alguno; y luego percibí, casi en
seguida que, con una exclamación de sorpresa, añadían:
--¡Es Silver en persona!
Al oir esto, dí un salto y restregándome todavía los ojos, corrí á una
de las troneras del reducto.

CAPÍTULO XX
LA EMBAJADA DE SILVER
¡Era cierto! Dos hombres estaban allá, fuera de la estacada, uno de
ellos agitando una bandera blanca, y el otro de pie, junto á él, con
tranquilo continente: este era nada menos que el mismísimo Silver.
Todavía era, á la sazón, bastante temprano, y la mañana era tan fría que
jamás sentí otra peor fuera de Inglaterra, pues un cierzo helado
materialmente penetraba hasta la médula de los huesos. El cielo estaba
claro, sin la más pequeña nube, y las cumbres de los árboles tenían en
aquel instante el tinte rosado de la mañana. Pero en el bajío en que
estaban Silver y su acompañante todavía quedaba bastante sombra y
aparecían como sepultados hasta la rodilla en una bruma baja, que
durante la noche había brotado del pantano. El cierzo frío y el vapor
aquel, existiendo al mismo tiempo, daban una idea de la isla, tristísima
por cierto. Era evidente que aquel era un lugar húmedo, pantanoso,
ardiente é insalubre por excelencia.
--¡Todo el mundo adentro!, gritó el Capitán; apuesto diez contra uno á
que esto envuelve alguna mala pasada.
Dicho esto gritó al pirata:
--¿Quién va? ¡Alto ahí, ó hacemos fuego!
--¡Bandera de paz!, respondió Silver.
El Capitán estaba colocado en el portalón, guardándose con el mayor
cuidado contra algún disparo traicionero en caso de que tal fuera el
intento de los piratas. Volvióse entonces á nosotros y nos dijo:
--Doctor, póngase Vd. de observación, situándose al costado Norte, si me
hace Vd. el favor. Jim, tú al Este. Gray, tú al Poniente. El ojo alerta
hacia abajo: todo el mundo á las armas cargadas. ¡Pronto, señores, y con
cuidado!
Dicho esto se volvió de nuevo á los rebeldes gritándoles:
--¿Y qué vienen Vds. á buscar aquí con su bandera de parlamento?
Á esta interpelación fué el hombre que agitaba el lienzo el que
respondió:
--Señor, el Capitán Silver desea pasar á bordo para hacer proposiciones.
--¿El Capitán Silver? ¡No sé quién es él, no lo conozco!, gritó el
Capitán Smollet.
Y pude oirle que añadía para sí, en voz más baja:
--¿Capitán, eh? ¡Diantre! ¡vaya si hay ascensos en la carrera!
Silver respondió entonces de por sí:
--Se trata de mí, señor. Esos pobres muchachos me han elegido su Capitán
después de la _deserción_ de Vd.
Recalcó muy bien la palabra _deserción_ y prosiguió sin detenerse:
--Estamos resueltos á someternos si nos es posible obtener algún
arreglo y nada más. Todo lo que yo pido es que me dé Vd. su palabra,
Capitán Smollet, de que me dejará salir sano y salvo fuera de esa
estacada y un minuto de plazo para ponerme fuera de tiro antes de que se
haya disparado un arma.
--Pues oiga Vd. esto, replicó el Capitán Smollet: lo que es yo no tengo
malditas la prisa ni la gana de hablar con Vd. Si Vd. quiere hablar
conmigo, puede Vd. entrar aquí y basta. Yo no tengo que empeñar mi
palabra á un hombre de su calaña; si hay en esto alguna traición oculta,
será sin duda del lado de Vds., y en tal caso Dios les ayude.
--Me basta con eso, Capitán, contestó John Silver en tono satisfecho.
Una palabra de Vd. es más que suficiente. Yo sé lo que es un caballero;
puede Vd. creerlo.
Entonces pudimos ver al hombre de la bandera tratando de hacer
retroceder á Silver. No era esto muy de sorprendernos atendiendo al tono
caballeresco de la respuesta del Capitán. Pero Silver se le rió en las
barbas y golpeándole sobre el hombro pareció decirle que la idea de todo
temor ó alarma era perfectamente absurda. Entonces avanzóse hacia la
estacada, arrojó su muleta al otro lado y con gran vigor y destreza
logró salvar el cercado, saltando sano y salvo al recinto de la
empalizada.
Debo confesar que lo que sucedía en aquellos momentos me atraía
demasiado para que me fuera dable servir en lo más mínimo como
centinela. Desde luego había ya desertado de mi tronera de Oriente que
fué la que me designó el Capitán, y me había deslizado detrás de éste
que acababa de sentarse en el dintel del portalón, cruzando estoicamente
las piernas, recargando la cabeza sobre una de sus manos y dirigiendo
la vista con la mayor indiferencia á la fuente que burbujeaba y salía
rumorosa del caldero, para perderse correteando sobre la arena. Púsose,
además, á silbar el sonecillo de "_¡Venid mozos y mozas!_"
Á Silver le costaba un trabajo del diantre el subir por la ladera de la
loma. Lo escabroso de ésta, los troncos de los árboles cortados, que
estaban aun allí pegados unos á otros, y lo suave de la arena hacían que
él y su muleta me parecieran como un navío dando tumbos entre las olas
sin velas y sin timón. Pero él soportó aquello como un hombre, en
silencio, y por último llegó á la presencia del Capitán, á quien saludó
de la manera más cortés del mundo. Habíase colocado sus mejores arreos:
una gran casaca azul toda llena de botones de metal, le colgaba hasta
las rodillas, y un hermoso sombrero galoneado se ostentaba sobre su
cabeza, ligeramente echado hacia atrás.
--Y bien amigo, ¿ya está Vd. aquí?, dijo el Capitán levantando la cara.
Me parece que puede Vd. sentarse.
--¿Es que no me va Vd. á recibir allá adentro?, dijo Silver un tanto
cuanto quejoso. Me parece esta una mañana demasiado fría para que nos
estemos aquí, sentados sobre la arena.
--Amigo Silver, replicó el Capitán, si Vd. se hubiera conducido como un
hombre honrado, á estas horas estaría Vd. sentado muy agradablemente en
su galera. Esto no es más que la obra de Vd. mismo. Como cocinero de mi
buque, que era Vd., era tratado de la mejor manera del mundo; como
Capitán Silver, ó sea como amotinado y pirata, tiene Vd. por perspectiva
la horca.
--Sea enhorabuena, Capitán, respondió el cocinero sentándose en la
arena como se le indicaba. Luego tendrá Vd. que darme la mano para
levantarme, he ahí todo. ¡Bonito lugar, de veras, que se han encontrado
Vds.! ¡Ah! ¡allí está Jim! ¡Santos y felices días tengas tú, Hawkins!
¡Doctor! ¡Vd. también!, aquí me tiene Vd. á sus órdenes. Y bien, todos
Vds. están juntos, todos como en familia, por decirlo así, ¿no es esto?
--Amigo, dijo el Capitán, si ha venido Vd. para decir algo, me parece
que hará bien en despacharse luego.
--Tiene Vd. razón que le sobra, Capitán Smollet, contestó el pirata. El
deber antes que todo, no cabe duda. Pues bien, vamos al asunto: ayer nos
han dado Vds. muy buen quehacer; muy buen quehacer, no lo niego, sí
señor. Hemos visto que algunos de Vds. no se maman el dedo en llevando
un espeque entre las manos, ¡vive Dios que no! Por lo mismo, no trataré
de ocultar tampoco que algunos de mis muchachos se han bamboleado de
miedo; quizás todos estén en ese caso; tal vez yo mismo no las tengo
todas conmigo, y sea esa la razón de que me tenga Vd. aquí buscando un
avenimiento. Pero sépalo Vd. bien, Capitán; esto no sucederá dos veces,
¡por vida del diablo! Tendremos que hacer nuestros cuartos de centinela,
y no ir muy lejos en materia de rom. Puede que Vds. se figuren que
nosotros no fuimos más que una hoja de papel lanzada en un remolino.
Pero le diré á Vd.: lo cierto es que yo estaba bien en mis cabales; lo
que me pasaba es que me sentía cansado como un macho de noria, y con
sólo que se me hubiese llamado un segundo antes los habría cogido á Vds.
en el acto mismo. Todavía á esa hora él estaba vivo, bien vivo, no le
quepa á Vd. duda.
--¿Y bien?, dijo el Capitán Smollet con la mayor calma y sangre fría del
mundo.
Todo cuanto Silver decía en su enmarañado é inextricable lenguaje era
para el Capitán un verdadero enigma, pero nadie se lo habría figurado
por el tono de su voz. En cuanto á mí, comenzaba á tener una sospecha.
Las últimas palabras de Ben Gunn me vinieron á la memoria y me dí á
suponer que quizás habría hecho una visita á los piratas mientras
estaban reunidos en torno de su hoguera, completamente borrachos ó poco
menos, y acaricié con alegría la esperanza de que quizás ya no teníamos,
á esas horas, sino catorce enemigos con quienes lidiar.
--Y bien, contestó Silver, lo que hay es esto: que queremos ese tesoro y
que lo tendremos; esa es nuestra base. Vds., á su vez, pueden, sin
pérdida de tiempo, asegurar sus vidas, á lo que creo: esa es la base de
Vds. En poder de Vds. obra un mapa, ¿no es verdad?
--¡Bien podría ser!, murmuró el Capitán.
--¡Oh! lo es, de seguro, no me cabe duda, replicó Silver. No hay para
qué hacerse el misterioso con un hombre como yo; es esta una treta del
todo inútil, puede Vd. creerlo. Lo que quiero decir es que nosotros
necesitamos ese mapa. Por lo demás, nosotros nunca habíamos pensado en
hacer á Vd. el menor daño, ¡no señor!
--Amigo, esa no pega, le interrumpió el Capitán. Nosotros sabemos
perfectamente lo que Vds. se proponían hacer, y lo cierto es que no nos
importa un bledo, porque ya bien ve Vd. que, lo que es por ahora, los
tales propósitos son ya simplemente imposibles.
Y diciendo esto el Capitán miró con la mayor calma á su interlocutor y
se puso á llenar su pipa con tabaco.
--Si es que Gray ha podido... comenzó Silver.
--Suposición excusada, interrumpió el Capitán. Gray nada me ha dicho por
la sencilla razón de que nada le he preguntado. Y lo que es más todavía,
antes que acceder, preferiré ver volar en pedazos á Vd. y á él y á toda
esta isla bendita. Eso y nada más, mi amigo, es lo que yo opino de sus
proposiciones.
Esa bocanada--perdónese la palabra en gracia de esta exactitud--esa
bocanada de mal humor del Capitán, pareció enfriar bastante á Silver. Un
momento antes sus palabras iban ya tomando cierto tono provocativo, que
cesó ante aquella explosión como por encanto.
--¡Basta con esto!, dijo. No quiero más. No discutiré lo que caballeros
como Vd. consideren dentro ó fuera de las reglas y del espíritu de
verdaderos marinos. Entre tanto, y puesto que le veo á Vd. á punto de
encender su pipa, voy á tomarme la libertad de hacer otro tanto.
Dicho esto, llenó, en efecto, su pipa y la encendió.
Durante un rato considerable aquellos dos hombres se quedaron
silenciosos, sentados con la mayor calma, ya viéndose á la cara
mutuamente, ya arreglando su tabaco, ya inclinándose hacia adelante para
escupir.
--Veamos pues, resumió Silver; he aquí las cosas sin rodeos: Vds. nos
dan ese mapa para encontrar con él el tesoro y cesan ya de fusilar á
pobrecillos marineros, y de calentarse la cabeza aun en medio del sueño.
Vds. hacen esto y nosotros, en cambio, les damos á escoger una de dos
cosas: ó vienen Vds. á bordo con nosotros, una vez que el tesoro haya
sido embarcado, y en ese caso les doy á Vds. bajo mi verdadera palabra
de honor un _afilavis (affidavit_ quería decir) de que en una costa
habitada y segura los desembarcaré sanos y salvos; ó si esto no les
conviniera mucho por ser medio salvajes algunos de mis hombres, ó por
tener recelo de despertar antiguos rencores, entonces ¡qué demonio!
pueden Vds. estarse aquí, ¡sí señores! Dividimos las provisiones de boca
con Vds. á lo legal y justo, en proporción de lo que nos toque, á tanto
por cabeza y, lo mismo que en el caso anterior, les doy mi _afilavis_ de
que al primer buque que encontremos lo mando acá para recogerlos. No
dirá Vd. que esto es pura charla: la verdad es que Vds. no pueden
esperar nada mejor que lo que yo propongo. Espero pues (y al decir esto
levantó la voz considerablemente) que toda la tripulación--vamos al
decir--que toda la tripulación de este reducto, considerará bien mis
palabras, porque lo que he hablado para uno, hablado está para todos.
El Capitán Smollet se puso en pie, sacó las cenizas del fondo de su pipa
sacudiéndola sobre la palma de la mano y luego con toda su calma
anterior interrogó así á Silver:
--¿Es eso todo?
--¡Sí, por vida del infierno, esa es mi última palabra! Rehuse Vd. eso y
no volverán á oir Vds. de mí más que el zumbido de las balas de mis
mosquetes.
--Está muy bien, dijo el Capitán. Pues ahora óigame Vd. á mí. Si vienen
Vds. á presentarse aquí, de uno en uno y desarmados, me comprometo á
ponerlos á todos con grillos y esposas y llevarlos para que tengan un
proceso en regla, hasta Inglaterra. Si mi proposición no le conviene á
Vd., me llamo Alejandro Smollet, la bandera de mi Soberano está
enarbolada sobre esta casa y prometo enviarle á Vd. y á todos los suyos
á los apretados infiernos. Vds. no pueden hallar ni hallarán ningún
tesoro. Vds. no pueden navegar con esa goleta. Vds. no pueden batirnos.
Gray, solo, pudo salir fácilmente de entre las manos de cinco de los
suyos. Su navío está como encadenado, Maese Silver; Vds. están como
varados en una playa de sotavento y muy pronto se convencerá Vd. de
ello. Yo, pues, me quedo aquí, después de decirle lo que le he dicho,
que es, por cierto, lo último que me oirá Vd. de buenas palabras, porque
¡por vida del diablo! la primera vez que vuelva á encontrar á Vd., Maese
Silver, le meto una bala en la cabeza, como tres y dos son cinco. Pase
Vd. de allí. Sálgase en el acto de este lugar, mano sobre mano, y
despáchese pronto.
Silver era, en aquel momento, la estampa de la ira. Los ojos parecían
salírsele de las órbitas, de indignación. Sacudió el tabaco fuera de la
pipa y luego gritó:
--¡Déme Vd. la mano para levantarme!
--¡No por cierto!, replicó el Capitán.
--¿Quién de Vds. quiere darme la mano?, aulló dirigiéndose á nosotros.
Ninguno en nuestras filas se movió siquiera. Vomitando entonces las más
horribles blasfemias, se arrastró sobre la arena hasta que tuvo á su
alcance una de las pilastras del portalón de la cual se asió, y ya
entonces pudo enderezarse y ponerse en pie con su muleta. Caminó en
seguida, y con una acción despreciativa é insultante, bramó:
--¡Eso valen Vds.! Antes de que se haya pasado una hora, ya los pondré á
Vds. á hervir como ponche encendido, en su estacada. Rían Vds., ríanse,
¡con mil diablos!, antes de una hora ya podrán reir en el infierno, y
para ese tiempo los que se hayan muerto podrán llamarse los más
afortunados.
Con un nuevo y terrible juramento se alejó cojeando, señaló á su paso la
arena en que iba enterrándose, trepó sobre la estacada con ayuda del
hombre de la bandera, no sin fallar sus esfuerzos tres ó cuatro veces, y
un instante después desapareció entre los árboles.

CAPÍTULO XXI
EL ATAQUE
No bien hubo desaparecido Silver, el Capitán que le había seguido
escrupulosamente con la mirada, se volvió hacia el interior del reducto,
y con excepción de Gray no encontró á ninguno de todos nosotros en su
sitio. Fué aquella la primera vez que le ví verdaderamente enojado.
--¡Á sus puestos!, gritó.
Y cuando ya todos ganamos humildemente nuestras posiciones, prosiguió:
--¡Gray!, tendrás hoy una mención honorífica en el diario de á bordo:
has cumplido con tu deber como un buen marino. Sr. de Trelawney, me
sorprende la conducta de Vd. Doctor, yo creí que alguna vez había Vd.
llevado encima el uniforme del Rey, ¿es así como servía Vd. en Fontenoy,
señor? Si era así, mejor hubiera Vd. hecho en quedarse en su casa.
Los centinelas mandados por el Doctor estaban ya todos en sus troneras;
los demás hombres se ocupaban de cargar las armas, todos con la cara
bien encendida, puede creérseme, y, como dice el adagio inglés: "_con
una pulga en su oído_."
El Capitán vió á todos en silencio por algún rato y en seguida habló
así:
--Amigos míos, acabo de descargar sobre Silver una verdadera andanada.
Le he puesto, de propósito, en punto de brea hirviendo y así es que,
como ya nos lo ha anunciado él mismo, antes de que trascurra una hora,
tendremos que sufrir el abordaje. Son más que nosotros, no necesito
recordarlo, pero nosotros peleamos á cubierto: un minuto hace que tal
vez habría yo añadido "y con disciplina." No cabe duda, por lo mismo, de
que podemos darles una buena sacudida si Vds. gustan.
Dicho esto recorrió las filas para cerciorarse de que todo estaba listo
y en orden.
En los dos costados más angostos, ó sea en las cabeceras de la cabaña,
que veían al Este y al Oeste, no había más que dos troneras; en el lado
Sur que era en el que estaba el portalón, no había también más que dos,
y cinco en el muro del lado Norte. Teníamos por todo, unos veinte
mosquetes para siete que éramos. La leña había sido arreglada en cuatro
pilas,--llamémosles _mesas_--una hacia el medio de cada uno de los
lados, y sobre cada una de esas _mesas_, se colocaron cuatro mosquetes
bien cargados, listos para que los defensores del reducto los tuvieran á
la mano. En el centro los sables todos estaban alineados en orden.
--Apáguese el fuego, dijo el Capitán. El frío ha pasado ya y no es
conveniente que tengamos humo en los ojos.
El cesto de hierro con sus leños encendidos fué sacado por el Sr.
Trelawney en persona, fuera de la cabaña, y las brasas se apagaron con
arena.
--Hawkins no ha almorzado todavía, continuó el Capitán. Vamos, chico,
despáchate por tu mano y vuélvete á tu puesto á comer. Vivo, vivo,
muchacho; podría ser que lo necesitaras antes de poder hacerlo. Tú,
Hunter, sirve á todos un buen vaso de _cognac_.
Mientras esto se hacía, el Capitán completaba en su imaginación el plan
de defensa.
--Doctor, Vd. se situará en la puerta, continuó. Cuidado con exponerse;
manténgase Vd. á cubierto y haga fuego á través del portalón. Hunter, tú
te sitúas en el costado oriental, ¡allí!, Joyce, tú al otro lado, al
Oeste. Sr. de Trelawney, á Vd. que es el de mejor puntería, se le
encomienda, ayudado de Gray, la defensa de este largo costado del Norte
que tiene cinco troneras. Si algún peligro corremos, ese peligro está en
ese punto. Si ellos lograran subir hasta aquí y hacer fuego hacia
adentro del reducto, por nuestras propias troneras, las cosas se
empezarían á poner entonces de color de hormiga. Hawkins, ni tú ni yo
somos muy hábiles, según creo, para hacer puntería; nosotros, pues,
permaneceremos al lado de los tiradores ocupados en cargas las armas.
Como el Capitán lo dijo, el frío había ya pasado. Tan pronto como el sol
había dejado pasar sus rayos por sobre las copas de los árboles hasta
nosotros, se dejó sentir con toda su fuerza sobre las partes no
sombreadas y disipó en un instante la bruma del pantano. Muy pronto la
arena estaba ya abrasándose y la resina de los abetos comenzaba á
derretirse en los muros del reducto. Colgamos á un lado sacos y jubones,
las camisas se abrieron por las pecheras descubriendo nuestros cuellos
casi hasta los hombros y ya en esa actitud, cada uno estuvo de pie
firme, arma al brazo, en su puesto, con la doble fiebre del calor y de
la más ansiosa expectativa.
Así se pasó más de una hora.
--¡Mal rayo los parta! dijo el Capitán. Esto sí que es tan pesado como
una _calma-chicha_. Gray, sílbale al viento.
Como si alguien hubiera oído los votos del Capitán, en aquel mismo
instante nos llegó la primera noticia del ataque.
--Dispense Vd. Capitán, dijo Joyce; si descubro á alguno, ¿debo hacer
fuego?
--Ya lo he dicho antes, contestó el Capitán.
--Mil gracias, señor, contestó Joyce con la misma y tranquila cortesía.
Por algunos momentos nada sucedió, pero aquel corto diálogo nos había
puesto á todos alerta, concentrando toda nuestra vida en los oídos y los
ojos. Los tiradores seguían con sus mosquetes en las manos; el Capitán
en el centro del reducto con los labios muy apretados y con el ceño
fruncido.
Así trascurrieron unos segundos más hasta que de repente oímos á Joyce
preparar su arma y disparar acto continuo. Todavía no se apagaba el eco
de su detonación, cuando ya lo oímos repetido por disparos que partían
de afuera, uno tras de otro, en una descarga nutrida, sobre cada uno de
los cuatro costados del reducto. Varias balas dieron contra los postes
de los muros, pero ninguna penetró adentro. Cuando el humo se hubo
disipado, la estacada y el bosque que la circunda aparecían tan quietos
y desocupados como antes: ni una rama se movía; ni el brillo del cañón
de un sólo mosquete denunciaba la presencia de nuestros adversarios.
--¿Le acertaste á tu hombre?, preguntó el Capitán.
--No señor, replicó Joyce, me parece que no.
--Pues podía hacerse algo mejor que eso, á decir verdad, refunfuñó el
Capitán Smollet. Hawkins, carga otra vez ese mosquete. ¿Cuántos cree Vd.
que había del lado de Vd., Doctor?
--Puedo decirlo con toda precisión: tres disparos se hicieron de este
lado. He visto las tres llamaradas, dos de ellas muy juntas, y la otra
más lejana, hacia el Poniente.
--¡Tres! dijo el Capitán. ¿Y cuántas por el lado de Vd. Sr. de
Trelawney?
Esta pregunta no fué contestada con tanta exactitud. Según el Caballero,
los disparos hechos sobre el costado Norte eran unos siete, y ocho ó
nueve según el cómputo de Gray. De los lados Este y Oeste sólo un tiro
había partido. Era, pues, indudable, que el ataque iba á verificarse
sobre el lado Norte, y que en los tres costados restantes solamente se
nos iba á molestar con un aparato de hostilidades. Sin embargo, el
Capitán Smollet no hizo el menor cambio á sus disposiciones anteriores.
Si los sublevados logran salvar la empalizada y posesionarse de algunas
de nuestras troneras no ocupadas, de seguro que nos van á fusilar
impunemente como á ratas, dentro de nuestra misma fortaleza.
Pero no se nos dió mucho tiempo para deliberaciones. Repentinamente con
un fuerte grito de _¡Arriba!_ una pequeña nube de piratas saltó de entre
los árboles, en el lado Norte y se precipitó directamente sobre la
estacada. En el mismo instante los tiradores ocultos en el bosque
abrieron el fuego nuevamente y una bala de rifle silbó á través de la
puerta y, golpeando sobre el mosquete del Doctor, se lo hizo
literalmente añicos.
Los asaltantes se encaramaron sobre la empalizada como monos: el
Caballero y Gray hicieron fuego una y otra y otra vez, y tres hombres de
aquellos cayeron, uno, dentro del recinto de la empalizada, y dos hacia
fuera, aunque de estos últimos uno parece que estaba más azorado que
herido, porque no tardó casi nada en ponerse en pie y desaparecer en un
abrir y cerrar de ojos entre los árboles.
Dos, pues, habían mordido el polvo, uno había huído y cuatro habían ya
logrado entrar de pie firme en el recinto de nuestra defensa, mientras
que, al abrigo de los árboles siete ú ocho hombres, cada uno de los
cuales tenía evidentemente un surtido de varios mosquetes, mantenían un
fuego vivo y nutrido, aunque sin el menor resultado, contra los muros de
nuestro reducto.
Los cuatro que se habían arriesgado al asalto se lanzaron derechos sobre
el edificio, animándose mutuamente con gritos, y sintiéndose alentados
por los _hurras_ de los tiradores del bosque. Se hizo fuego sobre ellos
varias veces, pero se movían con tal rapidez y era tal la prisa de
nuestros tiradores que no se logró que ninguna de sus balas diera en el
blanco. En un momento los cuatro piratas habían trepado el declive de la
loma y estaba ya sobre nosotros.
La cabeza de Job Anderson apareció en la tronera del centro gritando con
una voz de trueno:
--¡Todos á ellos! ¡todos á ellos!
Al mismo instante otro pirata logró apoderarse del mosquete de Hunter
cogiéndoselo violentamente por el cañón y descargó sobre aquel leal un
golpe tan tremendo que lo hizo rodar en tierra sin sentido. Entre tanto,
un tercero corrió sano y salvo en torno de la casa y apareció
súbitamente en la puerta cayendo sobre el Doctor, cuchillo en mano.
Nuestra posición había cambiado por completo. Un momento antes
peleábamos nosotros á cubierto y el enemigo á campo raso; ahora nosotros
éramos los descubiertos é imposibilitados para volver golpe por golpe.
El interior del reducto estaba lleno de humo á cuya circunstancia
debimos, en parte, nuestra salvación relativa. Gritos, confusión,
relámpagos de armas de fuego, detonaciones y un gemido muy prolongado y
perceptible, todo esto repicaba de una manera atronadora en mis oídos.
¡Afuera, muchachos, afuera!, gritó el Capitán. ¡Á pelear al descubierto
y mano al arma blanca!
Yo arrebaté una cuchilla de las del centro y alguno que al mismo tiempo
se apoderaba de otra me infirió una cortada en los nudillos de la mano,
que casi ni sentí. Me lancé hacia la puerta, saliendo á la luz del sol.
Alguien, no sé quien, venía detrás de mí. Frente á mí el Doctor
perseguía á su asaltante ladera abajo y precisamente en el momento en
que mis ojos tropezaban con el grupo, el Doctor dejaba caer sobre su
enemigo un tajo soberbio que lo tiró en tierra revolcándose, con una
cuchillada que le dividía toda la cara.
¡Rodear la casa, muchachos, rodear la casa!, gritaba el Capitán. Al
oirle aquel grito noté, á pesar de la barahunda general, que en su voz
había un cambio muy notable.
Obedecí como un autómata volteando hacia el costado Este, con mi
cuchilla levantada. Pero al dar vuelta á la esquina del reducto, me
encontré frente á frente con Anderson. Aquel hombre rugía como una
fiera y su marrazo se alzó sobre su cabeza brillando la hoja en el aire
al rayo del sol. No tuve tiempo para sentir miedo: aquel hombre aún no
descargaba su mandoble sobre mí, cuando yo resbalé instantáneamente en
el declive y, perdiendo la pisada sobre la arena, rodé cuan largo era
por la bajada.
Cuando al abandonar el interior de la cabaña por orden del Capitán
aparecí en la puerta, ví que las reservas de los amotinados estaban ya
tratando de salvar la empalizada para acabar de dar buena cuenta de
nosotros. Un marinero que ostentaba una gorra encarnada y que se había
puesto la cuchilla entre los dientes, había ya logrado trepar y tenía
una pierna dentro del recinto de la estacada y otra afuera. Ahora bien,
mi caída fué tan rápida que cuando me puse de nuevo en pie todo estaba
aún en la misma posición; el hombre del gorro encarnado, todavía mitad
adentro y mitad afuera, y otro dejaba asomar la cabeza en aquel mismo
instante por sobre las extremidades de los postes. Pero rápido como
había sido ese momento, en él, sin embargo, se había decidido la
victoria en nuestro favor.
Gray, que seguía á tres pasos mi carrera, había derribado al gran
contramaestre en tierra antes de que hubiera tenido tiempo de recobrarse
por haber fallado su golpe sobre mí. Otro de ellos había recibido un
tiro mortal en el momento mismo en que iba á hacer fuego por una de las
troneras, y estaba allí, agonizando, con la pistola todavía humeante
entre sus manos. El Doctor, según pude notar, había dado buena cuenta de
un tercero con un tajo magnífico. De los cuatro que habían escalado la
empalizada, uno solo quedaba intacto y este, que había dejado escapar
su cuchilla en la refriega, ya iba en aquel momento saltando de nuevo
sobre la empalizada para ponerse á cubierto de la muerte que se cernía
sobre su cabeza.
¡Fuego desde adentro!, gritó el Capitán. ¡Y Vds. muchachos, al reducto
de nuevo!
Pero su orden ya no tuvo efecto: ningún disparo partió de las troneras y
el último de los asaltantes pudo escapar sano y salvo y desaparecer con
todos los demás en el bosque. En tres segundos no quedaban ya más trazas
de los asaltantes que los cinco de ellos que habían caído en la
refriega, de los cuales, cuatro yacían dentro y el quinto fuera del
recinto de la estacada.
El Doctor, Gray y yo corrimos con todas nuestras fuerzas para ponernos
al abrigo, pues era probable que los asaltantes volvieran pronto del
lugar en que habían dejado sus mosquetes y abrieran una vez más el fuego
sobre nosotros.
Nuestra casa, á la sazón, estaba ya bastante despejada del humo y
pudimos ver, á la primera ojeada, el precio á que habíamos comprado la
victoria. Hunter yacía sin sentido al pie de su tronera. Joyce, cerca de
él, con una bala en el cerebro, yacía también para no volver á moverse
nunca, y en el medio del recinto el Caballero estaba sosteniendo al
Capitán, tan pálido el uno como el otro.
--El Capitán está herido, dijo el Sr. de Trelawney.
--¿Han corrido esos?, preguntó el Capitán Smollet.
--Piernas les faltaban, contestó el Doctor. Pero allí están cinco de
ellos que no volverán á correr más.
--¿Cinco?, exclamó el Capitán. ¡Tanto mejor, vamos! Cinco de ellos y
tres de nosotros; eso nos deja nueve contra cuatro. Eso es ya mucho
menos desproporcionado que en un principio. Entonces éramos siete para
diez y nueve; al menos así lo creíamos, lo cual es casi tan malo como
serlo en realidad.
Los sublevados no fueron ya muy pronto sino ocho, pues el hombre herido
por el Caballero, á bordo del buque, con su disparo hecho desde el
serení, murió aquella misma noche á causa de sus lesiones. Esto, sin
embargo, no se supo en nuestro reducto sino después.

PARTE V
_MI AVENTURA DE MAR_
CAPÍTULO XXII
DE CUAL FUÉ EL PRINCIPIO DE MI AVENTURA
Los sublevados no volvieron ya; ni siquiera un disparo más volvió á
salir de entre los árboles. Ya habían recibido _su ración_ por aquel
día, según la frase del Capitán y quedábamos, por tanto, en posesión de
nuestro reducto, con tiempo para cuidar y trasladar los heridos, y para
hacer la comida. El Caballero y yo pusimos nuestra cocina afuera á pesar
del peligro que corríamos, pero aun allí podíamos difícilmente atender á
lo que traíamos entre manos á causa de los quejidos y lamentos que nos
llegaban de los pacientes del Doctor.
De ocho personas que habían caído durante la batalla, solo tres
respiraban aún: el pirata que fué herido junto á la tronera, Hunter y el
Capitán Smollet; y aun de estos, los primeros eran poco menos que
muertos. El sublevado murió, en efecto, bajo el bisturí del Doctor y en
cuanto á Hunter por más esfuerzos que se hicieron para volverlo á sus
sentidos, no tuvo ya conciencia de sí mismo en este mundo: agonizó todo
el día, respirando fuerte y penosamente como el viejo filibustero cuando
yacía víctima de aquel terrible ataque apoplético; pero los huesos del
pecho habían sido despedazados por el golpe y el cráneo se había
fracturado con la caída, por lo cual, al llegar la noche, sin voz ni
estremecimiento alguno entregó el alma á su Hacedor.
Las heridas del Capitán eran graves, en verdad, pero no fatales. No
había órgano alguno interesado con lesión mortal. La bala de Ánderson,
que fué la que primero le hirió, había roto la parte superior del hombro
y tocado ligeramente uno de los pulmones. La segunda bala le había nada
más atravesado la pantorrilla rasgándole y dislocándole algunos
músculos. Su restablecimiento era seguro, al decir del Doctor, pero
entre tanto y por el espacio de semanas enteras, no debería ni andar ni
mover su brazo, y aun de hablar debía abstenerse hasta donde le fuera
posible.
Mi cortada accidental en los nudillos era un rasguño insignificante; el
Doctor me curó poniéndome algunas tiras de tela emplástica y me dió un
tirón de orejas por haber salido tan bien librado.
Cuando terminamos nuestra comida, el Caballero y el Doctor se sentaron
en consulta al lado del Capitán, y cuando ya habían hablado cuanto
tenían que decir, y siendo, á la sazón, cerca de medio día, el Doctor
tomó su sombrero, se puso al cinto sus pistolas, depositó en su bolsa de
pecho la carta del Capitán Flint, y poniéndose un mosquete al hombro y
un sable á la cintura, cruzó la empalizada por el lado Norte y se
aventuró vigorosamente en medio de los árboles.
Gray y yo estábamos sentados juntos en el extremo opuesto del reducto,
de manera de estar fuera del alcance de la conversación de nuestros
superiores en consulta. Gray retiró la pipa de sus labios y no volvió á
acordarse de llevarla á ellos nuevamente: tanto así lo dejaba atónito lo
que veía.
¡Por vida del demonio!, exclamó, ¿se ha vuelto loco el Doctor Livesey?
--No, á lo que creo, le respondí. Me parece que de todos nosotros es él
el menos expuesto á ese accidente.
--¡Cáspita, chico, pues si no lo está él, oye bien lo que te digo, debo
estarlo yo!
--Es posible, le repliqué. El Doctor tiene su idea y, si no me equivoco,
creo que va ahora á buscar á Ben Gunn.
Los sucesos demostraron que estaba yo en lo justo y racional. Pero entre
tanto, como el reducto aquel estaba caliente como un horno y la arena de
afuera ardiente como una brasa, con el sol de mediodía, comenzó á bullir
en mi cabeza una idea de la cual no podía decirse como de la otra que
era racional ni justa. Lo que me pasó fué que empecé á envidiar al
Doctor marchando á la fresca sombra de los árboles, rodeado de pájaros y
aspirando el fresco olor de los pinos; mientras yo estaba allí,
asándome, con la espalda pegada á aquellos maderos que saturaban mi
traje con su resina á medio fundir, rodeado de sangre por todas partes,
en medio de tantos cadáveres tendidos á mi alrededor, y tanto pensé en
ello que acabé por sentir hacia aquel lugar un disgusto que era casi tan
fuerte como el miedo mismo.
Todo el rato que estuve ocupado lavando el interior del reducto y en
seguida aseando los trastos para la comida, ese disgusto y esa envidia
continuaron acentuándose más y más en mi ánimo hasta que, por último,
encontrándome á mano una canasta de pan, y no habiendo en aquel instante
nadie que me observara, me llené de bizcochos todas las faltriqueras y
dí con eso el primer paso en la vía de mi escapada.
Era yo un buen tonto, si se quiere, y ciertamente lo que yo iba á hacer
no podía calificarse sino como una locura y un acto temerario, pero yo
estaba bien determinado á llevarlo á cabo, con todas las precauciones
que me era dable tomar. Aquellos bizcochos, caso de que algo me
sucediera, podrían alimentarme, por lo menos, hasta el día siguiente.
Después de los bizcochos, la próxima cosa de que me apoderé fué un par
de pistolas, y como yo tenía ya de antemano un polvorín y balas, me
sentí suficientemente provisto de armas.
Por lo que hace al proyecto en sí, tal como estaba en mi cabeza, me
parece que no era del todo malo: iba á buscar, en la división arenosa
existente entre el fondeadero y el mar abierto, la _Peña blanca_ que
había visto la víspera, y cerciorarme si era ella ó no la que escondía
el bote de Ben Gunn; cosa bien digna de ejecutarse, según todavía hoy me
parece. Pero teniendo como tenía la seguridad de que no se me permitiera
abandonar el recinto de la estacada, mi plan se redujo á despedirme á la
francesa y deslizarme afuera cuando nadie pudiera verme, lo cual era en
sí tan malo, que bastaba para hacer todo mi pensamiento reprensible.
Pero yo no era más que un muchacho y mi resolución estaba perfectamente
tomada.
Ahora bien, las cosas se me presentaron, al cabo, de tal manera, que
encontré una oportunidad admirable para mi objeto. El Caballero y Gray
estaban muy entretenidos arreglando los vendajes del Capitán, la costa
estaba libre, me lancé ágilmente sobre la estacada, me interné en la
espesura de los árboles y antes de que mi ausencia pudiera ser notada,
ya estaba yo fuera del alcance de la voz de mis compañeros.
Esta era ya mi segunda locura, mucho peor que la primera, supuesto que
no dejaba en la casa sino dos hombres sanos y salvos para custodiarla,
pero, como la primera, esta segunda calaverada contribuyó á salvarnos á
todos nosotros.
Hice rumbo derecho hacia la costa oriental de la isla, pues mi
resolución era ir á la punta por el lado que daba al mar, para evitarme
toda probabilidad de ser observado desde el fondeadero. La tarde estaba
ya bastante adelantada, pero todavía brillaba el sol y no era poco el
calor que se hacía sentir aún. Mientras proseguía mi marcha, cortando el
alto y espeso bosque, escuchaba allá á lo lejos, delante de mí, no sólo
el trueno continuo de la marejada, sino cierto frotamiento de hojas y
crujidos de ramas que me demostraban que la brisa del mar se había
desatado más fuerte que de ordinario. Muy pronto, bocanadas de aire
fresco comenzaron á llegar hasta mí y á pocos pasos me encontré ya en
los bordes abiertos del boscaje y pude ver el mar azul y lleno de sol,
reverberando desde la orilla hasta el límite lejano del horizonte,
mientras sus oleadas murmuraban, recortando sus caprichosas siluetas de
espuma á lo largo de la playa.
Nunca he visto el mar tranquilo en todo el derredor de la Isla del
Tesoro. El sol puede lanzar desde arriba cuanto calor le sea posible;
puede muy bien la atmósfera estar sin una sola ráfaga de viento, y la
superficie lejana de las aguas tersa y azul; esto no impedirá jamás que
aquellas grandes moles de agua espumante rueden á lo largo de toda la
costa tronando siempre, tronando de día y de noche, de tal suerte que
apenas habrá lugar alguno en la isla entera en donde se pueda uno
libertar de oir aquel rumor eterno.
Yo seguí entonces el borde de la playa, marchando junto á la rompiente,
con gran deleite mío, hasta que, juzgándome ya bastante lejos hacia el
Sur, me interné de nuevo en la espesura del bosque y me fuí serpeando
cautelosamente hacia la parte elevada de la punta, término de mi viaje.
Á mi espalda estaba el mar y al frente el fondeadero. La brisa de la
mar, como si hubiera gastado toda su fuerza en el soplo violento de
hacía un rato, había cesado ya, y le sucedían ahora suaves corrientes de
aire cuya dirección variaba del Sur al Sudeste, arrastrando grandes
masas de niebla. El ancladero, á sotavento de la Isla del Esqueleto,
seguía terso y plomizo como cuando penetramos á él la mañana del día
anterior. _La Española_ se reproducía toda entera en aquel tranquilo
espejo, retratando su casco, desde la línea de flotación, hasta los
topes de los mástiles en que flotaba la bandera de los piratas.
Á uno de los costados se veía yaciendo uno de los esquifes y Silver
aparecía junto á una de las velas de popa. Al hombre aquel siempre me
era fácil reconocerlo. Dos de los sublevados aparecían recargados en la
balaustra; uno de ellos era el mismo hombre de la gorra encarnada que
pocas horas antes había yo visto á horcajadas sobre la empalizada. Al
parecer no hacían más que hablar y reir, aun cuando á la distancia á que
yo me encontraba de ellos--algo más de una milla--no podía llegarme, por
supuesto, ni una sola palabra de lo que conversaban. En aquel instante
comenzó de repente el más horrendo é indescriptible rumor de alaridos
que de pronto me alarmaron bastante, aunque luego reconocí, por fortuna,
la voz de _Capitán Flint_ y aun me pareció distinguir al pájaro mismo,
con su brillante plumaje verde, saltar sobre el puño de su amo.
Pocos momentos después ví que el esquife se movía empujado hacia la
playa por el hombre de la gorra encarnada y su compañero que habían
descendido á él por la porta de popa.
Al mismo tiempo que sucedía esto el sol se ocultaba tras la cumbre del
"Vigía," y como la niebla se amontonaba rápidamente, todo comenzaba á
ponerse oscuro de veras. Ví, en consecuencia, que no tenía tiempo que
perder si es que debía encontrar el bote aquella misma tarde.
La _Peña blanca_, bastante visible sobre los arbustos, estaba todavía
como á un octavo de milla distante de mí, hacia la parte baja de la
_punta_, y así es que dilaté aún un poquillo antes de llegar á ella,
teniendo, á trechos, que marchar en cuatro pies entre las zarzas y
retamas. Era ya casi de noche cuando puse mis manos sobre sus ásperos y
escabrosos costados. Justamente abajo percibí un pequeño hueco de verde
césped, oculto por montoncillos de tierra y un matorralillo de arbustos
no más altos que la rodilla, que crecían allí abundantemente, y en el
centro de la hondonada, no me cabía duda, se miraba una pequeña tienda
hecha de pieles de cabra, como las que los gitanos tienen la costumbre
de llevar consigo en Inglaterra.
Me deslicé adentro de la cuenca, levanté uno de los lados de la tienda y
allí, en efecto, estaba el bote de Ben Gunn, manufactura casera si
alguna vez las hubo. Era éste una tosca estructura de madera correosa,
apenas desmochada, y extendida sobre ella una piel de cabra con el pelo
hacia adentro. Aquel juguete era en extremo pequeño, hasta para mí, y
puedo difícilmente creer que hubiera podido sostenerse á flote con un
hombre de talla ordinaria. Veíase en él un banco de remero tan bajo como
era posible imaginarse, una especie de apoyo para los pies hacia la proa
y unos dos canaletes ó remos para la propulsión.
Hasta aquel día jamás me había sido dable tener ante mis ojos uno de
esos botes enteramente rudimentarios y primitivos usados por los
antiguos pescadores bretones y aun parece que también por los egipcios,
y que en la vieja Bretaña se llamaron _coracles_,[6] pero en aquel
momento tenía un verdadero _coracle_ en mi presencia, y no me será
posible dar mejor idea de él sino diciendo que era, sin duda alguna,
igual al primero y más imperfecto aparato de flotación que fabricara el
hombre. Pero la verdad es que, con todos los defectos del _coracle_,
tenía, como este, la gran ventaja de ser en extremo ligero y portátil.
Ahora bien, se supondrá que una vez que hube encontrado mi bote tuve ya
con eso bastante para sentirme satisfecho de mi truhanería por aquella
vez; pero el caso es que, durante aquel tiempo, otra ocurrencia había
venido á herir mi imaginación, y tanto me apasioné de ella que se me
figura la habría llevado á cabo en las barbas del mismo Capitán Smollet.
Esta ocurrencia fué la de aventurarme en aquel bote, protegido por la
sombra de la noche, llegar suavemente hasta _La Española_, cortar el
cable de su ancla y dejarla echarse sobre la playa á donde la llevara su
buena ó mala ventura. Yo me había fijado en que, después de la lección
que los rebeldes acababan de recibir aquel día, probablemente no
encontrarían cosa mejor que hacer que levar anclas y lanzarse con la
goleta al mar. Parecióme conveniente y grato de veras el impedirles
llevar á cabo tal resolución y me afirmé en la practicabilidad de mi
pensamiento cuando ví como dejaban al guardián de la nave, encastillado
en ella, sin un sólo bote á su disposición.
Me senté, pues, á esperar que se hiciera bien densa la oscuridad y me
puse, entretanto, á comer con gran apetito algunos de mis bizcochos. Era
aquella una noche, única quizás, entre diez mil, para realizar mi
propósito. La niebla había sepultado completamente el cielo y el
horizonte. Conforme los últimos rayos del crepúsculo desaparecían, la
oscuridad más completa caía sobre la Isla del Tesoro. Así es que, cuando
concluí por echarme á cuestas el botecillo aquel y me encaramé como Dios
me ayudó para salir de la hondonada en que acababa de cenar, no quedaban
ya más que dos puntos visibles en todo el ancladero.
Uno de ellos era la gran hoguera encendida en la playa, en torno de la
cual los derrotados piratas se consolaban de su desastre en medio de
una tremenda borrachera, á orillas del juncal. El otro, que no era sino
un reflejo de luz opaca rompiendo apenas las tinieblas, indicaba la
posición del navío al ancla. La bajamar le había hecho describir un
semicírculo completo en torno de su amarre, de manera que á la sazón la
proa estaba vuelta hacia mí. Las únicas luces encendidas á bordo estaban
en la popa y en la cámara, de suerte que el ligero resplandor que yo
veía no era más que el reflejo, sobre la niebla, de los fuertes rayos
luminosos que se escapaban de la ventanilla de popa.
La marea había bajado hacía ya mucho rato, así es que tuve que ir
vadeando por largo trecho en una arena pantanosa en la cual varias veces
me sumí hasta la pantorrilla, antes de que pudiera llegar al límite en
que el agua seguía su marcha de retroceso. Con alguna fuerza y no escasa
destreza vadeé el agua del mar como lo había hecho en la playa y con
toda felicidad boté quilla-abajo mi _coracle_ sobre la movediza
superficie.

CAPÍTULO XXIII
EL REFLUJO CORRE
El esquife de Ben Gunn, como yo me lo figuré desde antes, con sobra de
razón, era un bote muy seguro para una persona de mi estatura y de mi
peso, y tan ligero como boyante siguiendo su vía por el mar; pero era,
al mismo tiempo, el más intratable y desobediente navichuelo que puede
imaginarse para lo que se refería á su manejo. Por más que uno hiciera,
él siempre se iba de lado, á sotavento, de preferencia á cualquiera otra
dirección, así es que el ir siempre volteando y volteando era la
maniobra que más se acomodaba con su naturaleza. Recuerdo que el mismo
Ben Gunn me había dicho que su bote era extraño y difícil para manejar
hasta que se le _cogía el modo_.
Y la verdad es que yo no le "sabía su modo." Entre mis manos iba y
volvía en todas direcciones excepto en la que yo necesitaba. Nuestra
marcha casi constante era sobre un costado, y tengo la seguridad de que,
á no ser por la ayuda de la marea, jamás hubiera logrado llevar el
barquichuelo aquel á donde yo quería. Por mi buena suerte, por más que
yo remaba, el reflujo seguía arrastrándome siempre hacia abajo, en la
dirección precisa en que yacía anclada _La Española_, de la que, por
tanto, era punto menos que imposible desviarme.
Al principio no veía delante de mí más que un borrón, más negro aún que
la misma oscuridad; á poco, casco, mástiles y cordaje comenzaron á tomar
forma distinta á mis ojos y un momento después (que no fué más, supuesto
que la corriente de la marea me arrastraba cada vez con mayor
violencia), ya estaba mi botecillo al lado de la guindaleza de la cual
me cogí en el acto.
La guindaleza estaba tan tirante como la cuerda de un arco, y la
corriente era tan fuerte que mantenía á la goleta en una gran tensión
sobre su ancla. En torno del casco la corriente bullía, escarceaba, y
burbujante y murmuradora, se rompía sobre los costados de la goleta,
como un arroyuelo que baja saltando por las vertientes de una montaña.
No tenía, ya que hacer otra cosa sino dar un corte á aquella cuerda con
mi navaja de á bordo, y _La Española_ se iría zumbando corriente abajo.
Todo eso estaba muy bueno; pero cuando ya me disponía á completar mi
hazaña, me ocurrió repentinamente que una guindaleza cortada de súbito
es una cosa tan peligrosa como un caballo que da coces. Las
probabilidades eran diez contra una de que, si era bastante temerario
para cortar á _La Española_ de su ancla, tanto mi navichuelo como yo
teníamos que pagar demasiado caro aquel atrevimiento, con un naufragio
casi seguro.
Esta consideración me detuvo en el acto y si la fortuna no me hubiera
favorecido de nuevo de una manera muy particular, habría tenido que
abandonar mi designio por completo. Pero los vientos mansos que habían
comenzado á soplar de Sudeste y del Sur, habían cambiado, después de
entrada la noche, en dirección del Sudoeste. Precisamente en el tiempo
que yo gasté en reflexionar, vino una bocanada que cogió á la goleta,
empujándola hacia la corriente y, con gran regocijo mío, sentí que la
tensión de la guindaleza, que tenía aún cogida, disminuyó tanto que, por
un momento, la mano con que la sujetaba se encontró sumergida dentro del
agua.
Esto bastó para que yo formara mi resolución: saqué mi navaja, la abrí
con los dientes y, con las mayores precauciones, fuí cortando, uno tras
de otro, los hilos de aquella cuerda, hasta que la goleta quedó
sostenida por dos únicamente. Entonces me detuve, esperando, para cortar
estos dos últimos á que la tensión se aligerase de nuevo por otra ráfaga
de viento.
Durante todo este tiempo no había cesado de oir voces que, partiendo de
la cámara de popa, se elevaban en un diapasón bastante alto; pero á
decir verdad, mi imaginación estaba de tal manera preocupada con otras
ideas, que apenas si había prestado oído. Pero á la sazón, que ya tenía
mucho menos que hacer, comencé á parar mientes algo más en lo que se
decía.
Desde luego pude reconocer la voz del timonel Israel Hands, el antiguo
artillero del buque del Capitán Flint. La otra era, por de contado, la
de mi conocido el hombre del birrete rojo. Ambos estaban borrachos como
una cuba, lo que no les impedía seguir bebiendo, pues durante mi
escucha, uno de ellos, con un grito de ebrio, se asomó á la porta de
popa y arrojó por ella un objeto que me pareció ser una botella vacía.
Pero no solamente estaban bebidos, sino que pude cerciorarme fácilmente
de que se encontraban en pleno estado de riña. Los juramentos
menudeaban como granizos y á cada instante se dejaban oir tales
explosiones de ira, que me pareció indudable que aquello iba á concluir
á golpes. Sin embargo, una y otra de esas explosiones pasaron sin ir á
más; las voces tornaban á gruñir en tono más bajo por algún rato, hasta
que se presentaba la próxima crisis y pasaba, como las precedentes, sin
resultados.
Allá, sobre la playa, distinguíase aún el resplandor de la gran hoguera
del campamento, brillando vigorosa á través de los árboles de la playa.
Alguien de entre los piratas estaba cantando una vieja y monótona
canción marina, con un suspiro y un gorjeo al final de cada verso y, á
lo que parecía, sin terminación posible, sino era la de la paciencia del
cantador. Más de una vez durante la travesía oí esa misma cantinela, de
la cual recordaba estos dos versos:
    "_No tornó á bordo sino un hombre vivo,_
     _Cuando eran, al zarpar, setenta y cinco._"
Parecióme aquel un estribillo muy dolorosamente adecuado á una
tripulación como la nuestra que acababa de sufrir pérdidas tan crueles
en la mañana misma de ese día. Pero, á la verdad, lo que yo ví por mí
mismo me confirmó en la idea de que aquellos filibusteros eran tan
insensibles como el mar sobre que navegaban.
La ráfaga de brisa que yo esperaba llegó al fin; la goleta se ladeó un
poco y se acercó más á mí, en medio de la oscuridad. Una vez más sentí
que la guindaleza se aflojaba en mi mano y con un bueno aunque penoso
esfuerzo corté las últimas fibras que aún sujetaban á _La Española_.
La acción de la brisa sobre mi navichuelo era casi imperceptible, lo
que no impidió que casi al punto me sentí arrastrado contra la proa de
la goleta. Pero, libre ya de sus ligaduras, _La Española_ comenzó á
girar sobre su propio eje, tornándose con lentitud á través de la
corriente.
Trabajé como una furia, porque á cada instante esperaba verme sumergido,
y tan luego como ví que me era imposible dirigir mi barquichuelo de modo
de salir resueltamente del círculo que describía la goleta, preferí
empujarlo en derechura hacia la popa. Por último me ví libre del alcance
de mi peligrosa vecina, pero en el instante mismo en que imprimía el
último impulso á mi _coracle_ mis manos tropezaron con una cuerda ligera
que la goleta iba arrastrando á popa, de sobre la borda. Rápida é
instintivamente me apoderé de ella.
¿Qué fué lo que dictó ese movimiento? Me sería muy difícil explicarlo:
fué, como antes dije, un acto de mero instinto; pero no bien tuve en mis
manos aquel cabo y me cercioré de que estaba bien sujeto por arriba, la
curiosidad comenzó á sobreponerse en mí á todo otro sentimiento y
determiné satisfacerla, echando una ojeada al interior del buque á
través de la ventanilla de popa.
Fuí avanzando una mano y después otra por la cuerda, y cuando me creí á
buena distancia, no sin un inmenso peligro, me icé cuidadosamente hasta
una altura doble que la elevación de mi cuerpo, poco más ó menos, lo
cual me permitió pasear la vista por el techo y una parte del interior
de la cámara.
Á este punto tanto la goleta como su microscópico apéndice se iban ya
escurriendo con bastante velocidad sobre las aguas y no cabía duda de
que nos hallábamos á la altura del campamento de los piratas. El navío,
como dicen los marineros, iba hablando en voz alta, hollando los
incontables borbollones, con un bamboleo incesante y desordenado. No
bien hube visto á través de la porta, comprendí por qué razón aquel
bamboleo extraño no había provocado alarma alguna en los vigilantes de
la goleta. Una ojeada me bastó para explicármelo, y debo añadir que una
ojeada fué todo lo que me atreví á aventurar, desde aquel inseguro
apoyo. Lo que ví fué que Hands y su compañero estaban allí encerrados
juntos, empeñados en un combate encarnizado, cada uno con la mano echada
á la garganta de su adversario.
Me deslicé otra vez sobre el travesaño de mi esquife, y á fe que ya era
tiempo, pues con un segundo más de dilación habría sido hombre al agua
infaliblemente. No podía ver nada por el momento, á no ser aquellas dos
horribles caras amoratadas por la furia, retorciéndose en gestos
abominables bajo la humeante lámpara: tuve, pues, que cerrar los ojos
para acostumbrarlos de nuevo á la oscuridad por algún rato.
Cuando esto pasaba, la balada aquella cantada en el campamento, que
amenazaba durar eternamente, había concluído ya, y la bien sisada
compañía de piratas, reunida en torno del fuego, prorrumpía á la sazón
en aquel coro que tan conocido me era:
    "_Son quince los que quieren el cofre de aquel muerto,_
     _Son quince ¡yo--ho--hó! son quince ¡viva el rom!_
     _El diablo y la bebida hicieron todo el resto,_
     _El diablo ¡yo--ho--hó! el diablo ¡viva el rom!_"
Precisamente, pensaba yo, á aquella misma hora ¡qué ocupados andaban la
bebida y el diablo en la cámara de _La Española_! En esto sorprendióme
sobremanera sentir que mi esquife zozobraba repentinamente; guiño de
una manera viva y pareció cambiar de dirección. Observé, al mismo
tiempo, que la rapidez de la marcha aumentaba de una manera extraña.
La sacudida me había obligado á abrir los ojos. En todo mi derredor
advertí pequeñas hinchazones del agua que se entumecía acompañada de un
sonido agudo y áspero, y presentaba reflejos fosforescentes. La misma
_Española_, en cuya estela iba yo arrastrado á pocas yardas de
distancia, me pareció que tambaleaba en su curso y que sus mástiles y
cordaje se echaban un poco de lado, contra la negrura de la noche; más
aún: examinando con más atención, no me cupo duda de que la goleta iba
rodando rumbo al Sur.
Dí una rápida ojeada sobre mi hombro y el corazón me dió un vuelco
terrible, presa del espanto. Allí, precisamente á mi espalda se veía el
resplandor de la hoguera del campamento. La corriente había volteado en
ángulo recto, barriendo con ella en su curso rápido, lo mismo al alto
buque que al diminuto y danzarín _coracle_. Y á cada instante su
velocidad aumentaba, y cada vez brotando más altas sus burbujas, cada
vez murmurando más y más recio corría y corría alejándose á través del
estrecho para engolfarse en alta mar.
De repente la goleta que iba á mi frente dió una guiñada violenta,
volteando quizás como unos veinte grados, y casi en el acto se oyeron á
bordo exclamaciones, una tras de otra, y luego el ruido de pasos
precipitados en la escala de la carroza. Era, pues, evidente, que los
dos borrachos se habían dado cuenta, al cabo, del desastre que
interrumpía su querella y los hacía despertar á la realidad.
Me tendí entonces boca abajo en el fondo de mi esquife y de todas veras
encomendé mi alma á Dios, porque creí llegado mi último momento. Tenía
por cosa inevitable que, á la salida del estrecho, deberíamos
embarrancar en algún arrecife ó estrellarnos contra algunas rompientes
enfurecidas, en las cuales todas mis cuitas encontrarían un pronto
término. Pero aun cuando no me asustaba tanto la muerte en sí, me era
imposible ver con serenidad el género de ejecución capital que se
aproximaba por instantes.
En aquella posición debo haber permanecido horas enteras, empujado de
aquí para allá sobre las altas olas, mojado de cuando en cuando por la
espuma que volaba en copos, y creyendo sin cesar que á la primera
sumergida me aguardaba la muerte. Gradualmente la lasitud y el cansancio
se fueron apoderando de mi estropeado cuerpo; luego un entorpecimiento
extraño, un estupor desusado cayeron sobre mí, aun en medio de mis
terrores, hasta que el sueño llegó, por último, y en aquel mi traído y
llevado esquife, dormí, dormí soñando con mi casa y con mi viejo
"_Almirante Benbow_."

CAPÍTULO XXIV
EL VIAJE DEL "CORACLE"
Era ya día claro cuando desperté y me encontré caracoleando sobre las
olas al Sudoeste de la isla. El sol se había ya levantado, pero todavía
estaba, para mí, oculto tras de la gran peña del "Vigía" que, por aquel
lado, casi bajaba hasta el mar en riscos formidables.
El Crestón de Bolina y el Cerro de Mesana estaban, por decirlo así, al
alcance de mi mano: el uno, negro y desnudo; el otro, rodeado de riscos
de cuarenta á cincuenta pies de altura y franjeado con grandes
cantidades de rocas desprendidas. No estaba yo á más de un cuarto de
milla distante de la costa, por lo cual mi primer pensamiento fué remar
y saltar en tierra.
Pero muy luego tuve que desistir de semejante idea. Sobre las rocas
desparramadas en la costa, las olas se desgajaban en mil pedazos,
bramando enfurecidas; un trueno sucedía á otro trueno y una explosión de
espuma á otra explosión, segundo por segundo, lo que me hizo comprender
que, si me aventuraba á aproximarme, ó tendría que perecer estrellándome
contra la escarpada orilla, ó que gastar mi fuerza, tratando de escalar,
en vano, los enhiestos despeñaderos.
Pero no era eso todo. Como queriendo reunirse para arrastrarse juntos
sobre una misma meseta de rocas, ó precipitándose al agua con estrépito
formidable, percibí una multitud de monstruos marinos, colosales,
viscosos, horrendos, que se me figuraron inmensos y blandos caracoles de
dimensiones increíbles. Creo que había allí unos cuarenta ó cincuenta de
ellos, haciendo retumbar los huecos de las rocas con sus espantables
gritos.
Después he sabido que aquellos animales no eran sino focas ó becerros
marinos, enteramente inofensivos. Pero su aparición en aquellos
momentos, añadida á lo escabroso de la playa y á la violencia desusada
con que se rompían las olas sobre ella, acabó por quitarme completamente
toda gana de bajar á tierra en semejante paraje. Más que á desembarcar
allí me sentí dispuesto á morir de hambre en medio del océano, por no
afrontar aquellos peligros.
Pero lo cierto es que tenía en espectativa una oportunidad mucho mejor
de lo que yo suponía. Al Norte del Crestón de Bolina, la tierra ofrece
una larga prolongación que deja, á la hora de la bajamar, una cinta de
arena amarillenta al descubierto. Al Norte de esa cinta, aparece otro
cabo--el _Cabo de la Selva_, según lo marcaba la carta--sepultado
literalmente en una masa de altísimos pinos que bajaban hasta la misma
orilla del mar.
Recordé lo que había dicho Silver acerca de la corriente que se dirige
hacia el Norte, siguiendo en toda su longitud la costa occidental de la
isla, y viendo, por mi posición, que me encontraba yo dentro de aquélla,
preferí dejar á mi espalda el Crestón de Bolina y reservar mi fuerza
para una intentona de desembarque en el Cabo de la Selva, cuyas playas
eran, sin duda, mucho más abordables y seguras.
Había, á la sazón, una gran cantidad de tumefacciones suaves sobre el
mar. El viento, que soplaba manso pero firme, de Sur á Norte, no era
obstáculo sino más bien ayuda para seguir el curso de la corriente y las
oleadas alzaban y abatían sus ondas sin despedazarlas.
Á no haber sido así, es indudable que mucho tiempo hacía que hubiera
perecido; pero yendo como iba, era de maravillar con qué facilidad y
cuán seguramente mi ligero botezuelo cortaba el agua. Con frecuencia,
desde el fondo en que me mantenía aún oculto, me era dable divisar
cerca, muy cerca de mí, una gran cima azul, sobresaliendo de la regala
de la borda. Aquella era una oleada, pero mi _coracle_ no daba más que
un ligero brinco, y listo como un pájaro caía en un instante al otro
lado en la hamaca que formaba el espacio que dividía las dos olas entre
sí.
Comencé entonces á cobrar bríos y me senté para poner á prueba mi
habilidad al remo. Pero el cambio más insignificante en la disposición
del peso, en una cascarita como aquella, produce los resultados más
violentos en su continente y marcha. Así es que, no bien me había movido
para sentarme, haciendo cesar desde luego su suave y acompasado balanceo
anterior, cuando me sentí arrojado directamente hacia abajo, y al sesgo
contra una ola bastante brava cuyo golpe me aturdió, al par que la
espuma, azotando sobre la pequeña proa, se desbarataba contra ella
alzándose casi tan alto como la ola que venía.
Á un mismo tiempo me sentí calado por el agua, y presa del terror, por
lo cual sin más dilación volví á colocarme en la postura que antes
tenía, con lo cual el botecillo pareció enderezarse de nuevo y llevarme
tan suavemente como al principio sobre las crestas de las grandes olas.
Era evidente que había que dejarlo ir á su antojo, sin meterme á
gobernarlo; pero la cuestión era que, á aquel paso ¿qué esperanza me
quedaba de ganar la playa?
Comencé, pues, á sentirme grandemente aterrorizado, pero, no obstante,
no perdí del todo la cabeza. Antes que todo, y procurando moverme lo
menos posible, vacié gradualmente el agua que se me había colado en el
brinco exabrupto de hacía un rato, usando para esta operación mi gorra
marina. Una vez hecho esto volví á echar una nueva ojeada sobre la
regala de la borda y traté de explicarme por qué razón mi _coracle_ se
deslizaba con tanta facilidad á través de las fuertes oleadas.
Advertí entonces que cada ola, en vez de la montaña suave, luciente y
enorme que se ve desde tierra ó desde la cubierta de un navío, no era
sino como una cadena de montañas de tierra firme, erizada de picos hacia
arriba y rodeada de sitios suaves y valles abiertos. Mi botezuelo,
abandonado á sí mismo, volteaba de un lado para otro, se devanaba, por
decirlo así, serpeando por las partes más bajas del agua, evitando
siempre trepar á las cimas ó aventurarse á los declives peligrosos de
aquellas líquidas alturas.
--Sea en hora buena, díjeme á mí mismo. Es claro que debo continuar
tendido en donde estoy y no perturbar el equilibrio, pero también me
parece evidente que, de cuando en cuando, puedo darme trazas, en los
parajes más tranquilos, parar dar una ó dos paladas de remo en dirección
de tierra.
Hícelo como lo pensé. Continué tendido, sobre mis codos en la postura
más espectante del mundo, á la capa, y aprovechando cada oportunidad que
se me presentaba para dar muy dulcemente una remada ó dos á fin de
enderezar la proa hacia la playa.
Era aquél un trabajo lento y fatigoso por demás, y sin embargo me sentía
ganar terreno; tanto que, conforme nos acercábamos al Cabo de la Selva,
si bien veía que no me era dable aún ganar aquella punta, pude notar con
alegría que había ya avanzado como unas cien yardas hacia tierra, al
Este. Muy cerca estaba de ella, en verdad. Ya me era dable distinguir
las frescas y verdegueantes copas de los árboles meciéndose suavemente
juntas al soplo de la brisa y tuve por cosa segura, en consecuencia, que
en el promontorio próximo era ya evidente mi desembarque.
Y á fe que no sería sino muy á tiempo, pues la sed comenzaba á hacerme
sufrir bastante. El resplandor del sol cayendo sobre mi cabeza y sus
rayos quebrándose sobre las olas en mil reflexiones diversas; el agua
del mar que caía y se secaba sobre mi cuerpo cubriendo mis labios con
una capa salobre; todo esto se combinaba para hacer que mi garganta
ardiera y mi cabeza fuera presa de un dolor violento. La vista de los
árboles á tan corta distancia me puso casi fuera de mí con el anhelo
vehemente de desembarcar. Empero la corriente me había arrastrado, antes
de mucho, lejos de la punta, y cuando me encontré de nuevo en mar
abierto, percibí algo que desde luego hizo cambiar la naturaleza de mis
pensamientos.
Precisamente frente á mí, á menos de media milla de distancia, se
aparecía ante mis ojos _La Española_ con sus velas desplegadas. No me
cupo duda de que iba á ser cogido, pero es el caso que la sed me hacía
ya sufrir de tal manera, que no puedo decir si sentía ó me alegraba de
aquella ocurrencia; y debo añadir que mucho antes de haber llegado á una
conclusión la sorpresa se había enseñoreado de mi ánimo á tal grado que
no podía hacer otra cosa sino maravillarme y clavar mis ojos en lo que
tenía á la vista.
_La Española_ llevaba al viento la vela mayor y dos foques, y la
blanquísima lona brillaba al sol como nieve ó plata. En el momento en
que la descubrí, sus velas hinchadas la empujaban bien, haciéndola
seguir una línea en dirección Noroeste, lo que me hizo presumir que los
hombres á bordo iban con la intención de dar la vuelta á la isla para
llegar así de nuevo al ancladero. Pero en aquellos momentos comenzó á
inclinarse más y más hacia el Poniente, visto lo cual me dí á creer que
me habían descubierto é iban á darme caza. Antes de mucho, empero, hizo
proa decididamente contra el viento y se vió detenida en su marcha por
algún tiempo, falta de propulsión, con sus velas estremeciéndose y
palpitando inútilmente.
--¡Vaya unos animales!, me dije. Esos bárbaros deben estar todavía más
borrachos que un alambique. ¡Ah! Si el Capitán Smollet fuera á bordo ya
tendrían que saltar listos esos desmañados.
En el interín la goleta viró un poco, hizo un bordo, y su lona la hizo
marchar de nuevo por uno ó dos minutos para caer inmóvil una vez más
contra el viento. La misma ocurrencia se repitió una y otra vez. De aquí
para allá, de arriba para abajo, de Norte á Sur y de Oriente á Poniente.
_La Española_ se ponía en marcha con una especie de arremetidas ó
disparos instantáneos, pero cada repetición de estas concluía como había
comenzado, dejando el velámen inutilizado y tremolando débilmente. No
tuve trabajo en comprender que nadie iba dirigiendo la embarcación, y
siendo esto así, ¿qué había sido de los dos hombres? Ó estaban ahogados
de borrachos, ó habían abandonado el buque, pensé yo, por lo cual, si
lograba entrar á bordo, tal vez me fuera dable volver aquel buque á su
Capitán.
La corriente iba arrastrando con igual velocidad hacia el Sur, tanto á
la goleta como al traído y llevado _coracle_. Por lo que hace á la
goleta su marcha era tan irregular é intermitente, supuesto que á cada
momento se veía como engrillada, que la verdad es que muy poco ó nada
ganaba, cuando no perdía terreno. Con sólo que me atreviese á sentarme
otra vez y tentar de nuevo al remo, estaba seguro de que pronto me sería
dable estar sobre ella. El proyecto tenía un sabor de aventura que
despertó mi apetito, no sin que lo acrecentara, duplicando mi energía,
el recuerdo de que frente á la carroza de proa estaba un buen depósito
de agua dulce en la codiciada _Española_.
Sentéme, pues, y como la vez primera que lo hice, fuí saludado por un
azote de agua y espuma, con la diferencia de que, por esta vez, el
empuje impreso al _coracle_ fué en mi favor. Dediquéme entonces á remar
con toda la precaución, pero con toda la energía de que era capaz, hacia
la no gobernada _Española_. En uno de mis impulsos, sin embargo, alojé
dentro del botezuelo tal cantidad de agua que tuve que parar mi maniobra
y estarme alerta sintiendo que los latidos del corazón iban á ahogarme.
Pero, ya más cauto y muy gradualmente, púseme al fin en el verdadero
camino de mi meta, guiando mi esquife bordeando las grandes olas y sin
poder impedir, con todo y eso, que la cresta de alguna azotara la proa
de mi barquilla y salpicara mi rostro con su desbaratada espuma.
Á la sazón mi avance sobre la goleta era ya rápido y perceptible. Ya
podía distinguir bien el brillo del metal en la caña del timón cuando
éste se movía golpeando, y sin embargo, todavía no aparecía un alma
sobre cubierta. No pude suponer otra cosa, en consecuencia, sino que la
goleta había sido abandonada. De no ser así, los hombres aquellos
deberían estar abajo borrachos, como muertos, en cuyo caso me sería
fácil quizás asegurarlos y hacer con la goleta lo que me pareciera.
Por un buen rato ésta se había mantenido haciendo lo que podía no ser
peor para mí, esto es, continuar en el mismo estado de inercia. Su proa
iba casi directamente al Sur, sin dejar de guiñar, por supuesto, á cada
momento. Á cada guiñada, dejaba caer hacia afuera sus velas, en parte
hinchadas, y éstas la volvían á poner, en un instante, enfilando el
viento una vez más. He dicho que esto era para mí lo peor de todo,
porque, sin gobierno como la goleta iba, con su velámen tronando como un
cañón y las olas azotando ruidosamente los costados y bañando la obra
muerta, continuaba, sin embargo, corriendo delante de mí, no sólo con la
velocidad natural de la corriente, sino con toda la fuerza de su deriva
que, naturalmente, era muy grande.
La oportunidad, al cabo, concluyó por presentárseme. La brisa se puso
por algunos momentos sumamente baja y la corriente que volteó con
lentitud á _La Española_ hizo que ésta concluyera por presentarme su
popa con la porta todavía abierta de par en par, y la lámpara sobre la
mesa encendida aún á pesar de ser de día. La vela mayor colgaba, en
aquel instante, desmayada y caída como una bandera. Nada, con excepción
de la corriente, interrumpía la inmovilidad de la embarcación aquella.
Durante un rato, poco hacía, en lugar de ganar, iba yo perdiendo
terreno; pero ahora, redoblando mis esfuerzos, comenzaba otra vez á
estar más cerca de mi caza.
No me faltaban ya ni cien yardas para llegar á ella cuando el viento
llegó otra vez con estruendo, hinchando la lona sobre las amuras de
babor, y acto continuo se me alejó otra vez deslizándose, ondeando y
casi volando como una golondrina.
Mi primer impulso fué de desesperación, pero el segundo fué de alegría,
porque hétela allí que, describiendo una gran curva, _La Española_ viene
hacia mí hasta ponerse frente á uno de mis costados; y continuando la
misma inesperada evolución, muy pronto la veo á la mitad, y luego á un
tercio, y luego á un cuarto de la distancia que nos separaba hacía poco.
Ya distinguía yo las olas que hervían bajo su gorja. ¡Qué enorme me
parecía la mole de aquella goleta vista desde mi bajísima estación en el
botezuelo!
Pero instantáneamente comprendí aquella situación y apenas si tuve
tiempo para pensar y menos aún para ponerme en salvo. Estaba yo con mi
_coracle_ en la cresta de un alta ola y la goleta venía sobre la cima de
la inmediata, abatiéndose sobre mí. ¡Un segundo de vacilación y mi
muerte era segura! El bauprés estaba sobre mi cabeza en aquel instante.
Rápido como el pensamiento me puse en pie y haciendo un impulso
desesperado salté haciendo desaparecer al _coracle_ bajo el agua. Con
una mano me había asido al botalón de foque, en tanto que mi pie estaba
alojado entre el estay y la braza. Y todavía no había yo tenido tiempo
de hacer el más pequeño movimiento para cambiar mi posición cuando el
rumor apagado de un golpe me dijo que la goleta se había cargado hacia
abajo acabando de hundir y despedazar el _coracle_ y que, por
consiguiente, allí quedaba yo, colgando entre cielo y mar, sin retirada
posible de _La Española_.

CAPÍTULO XXV
¡ABAJO LA BANDERA DEL PIRATA!
Apenas me había sido dable encaramarme en el bauprés cuando el ondulante
foque aleteó, por decirlo así, cargándose sobre la otra amura con un
ruido semejante á un cañonazo. La goleta se estremeció hasta la quilla
con aquella vuelta formidable, pero un momento después las otras velas,
que aún continuaban empujando, hicieron retroceder al foque á su lugar
anterior y ya entonces quedó suspenso é inmóvil.
En esos movimientos casi me ví zabullir dentro del agua, pero á la sazón
ya no perdí tiempo y me arrastré para atrás ó más bien me deslicé por el
bauprés hacia cubierta, en la cual caí como llovido del cielo, con el
rostro hacia el océano.
Me encontré á sotavento del castillo de proa, y la vela mayor que
continuaba todavía henchida, me ocultaba una buena parte de la cubierta
á popa. No ví un alma por todo aquello. Las tarimas, que no habían sido
lavadas desde que estalló la rebelión, enseñaban las huellas de
numerosas pisadas y una botella, rota por el cuello, rodaba de aquí para
allá, al vaivén del buque, como si fuera una cosa viva.
Inesperadamente _La Española_ enfiló el viento en una de sus bordadas:
los foques, tras de mí, tronaron con fuerza; el timón se cerró de golpe;
el navío entero se irguió y estremecióse como desfallecido ya, y en el
mismo momento el botalón del mayor se colgó hacia adentro, la vela cayó
también gimiendo débilmente sobre los motones y al plegarse me descubrió
á sotavento la parte de cubierta, á popa, antes oculta.
Sólo entonces aparecieron á mi vista los dos guardianes de la
embarcación. ¡No me cabía duda, eran ellos! Gorro Encarnado tendido boca
arriba, tieso como un espeque, con sus brazos abiertos como los de un
crucifijo y con los labios separados dejando asomar su amarillenta
dentadura. Israel Hands, recargado contra la balaustra de la cubierta,
con la barba sobre el pecho y sus manos abiertas apoyándose sobre el
piso y con el rostro tan blanco, bajo su tinte curtido, como la cera.
Por algún rato el buque siguió ladeándose ó encabritándose como un
caballo mañoso, y las velas hinchándose, ya sobre una amura ya sobre la
otra, y el botalón colgando y golpeando, hasta que el mástil pareció
quejarse al esfuerzo de aquellos violentos tirones. De vez en cuando
también una rociada de espuma cubría la balaustra y el buque daba un
fuerte golpe por la proa contra las hinchazones del agua en aquel mar de
leva. Convertíase éste en un temporal mucho más violento para un navío
de alto bordo como _La Española_, que lo era para mi caserito _coracle_
que á aquellas horas yacía ya en el fondo del océano. Á cada salto de la
goleta Gorro Encarnado se resbalaba de aquí para allí, pero ¡cosa
horrible! ni su actitud cambiaba, ni sus apretados dientes, asomando por
entre sus abiertos labios, se ocultaban por algún movimiento de
éstos, en aquel brusco traqueteo. Á cada brinco, también Hands aparecía
irse como sumiendo más y más, deslizándose sobre el piso de cubierta,
avanzando sus pies hacia el lado de proa y la caja del cuerpo
inclinándose hacia popa, de tal suerte que su cara se me fué ocultando
gradualmente hasta que concluí por no ver nada de ella, excepto la oreja
y una de las sortijas de la patilla.
[Illustration: "Marché resueltamente á popa y grité con un acento
irónico:--¡Hola, amigo Hands,..."]
Al mismo tiempo observé, en derredor de ambos, charcos de sangre
negruzca sobre las tarimas, y comencé á abrigar la certeza de que
aquellos hombres se habían dado la muerte mutuamente en su querella de
borrachos.
Todavía contemplaba aquel espectáculo sin volver en mí de la sorpresa,
cuando, en un momento de calma y antes de que el buque se meneara,
Israel Hands se medio volteó y con un quejido vago se enderezó
penosamente hasta colocarse en la posición en que primero le ví. Aquel
quejido que acusaba, al mismo tiempo, dolor y debilidad mortal, y el
aspecto que presentaba su quijada caida, me inspiraron de pronto una
compasión inmensa. Pero al pronto recordé las palabras que oí en boca de
aquel malvado, desde el barril de las manzanas, y todo sentimiento de
piedad desapareció de mi corazón.
Marché resueltamente á popa y grité con un acento irónico:
--¡Hola, amigo Hands, venga Vd. á bordo!
Paseó penosamente la mirada en torno suyo, pero su trastorno y
decaimiento eran tales que no cabía la sorpresa en su ánimo á aquellas
horas. Lo más que hizo fué dejar escapar esta palabra única:
--¡Aguardiente!...
Me ocurrió entonces que no debía perder un solo instante, y así fué que,
esquivando el botalón que aún seguía golpeando como antes, marché á popa
y bajé á la cámara por la escalera de la carroza.
La escena de confusión y desorden que allí presencié era indescriptible.
Todos los armarios y muebles con cerraduras de llaves habían sido rotos
para buscar la carta de Flint. El piso estaba saturado de lodo sobre el
cual los rufianes aquellos se habían sentado á beber y á consultar,
después de embriagarse en el marjal en torno de su hoguera. Las
mamparas, cuyo color era blanco mate con franjas de oro, mostraban en
toda su extensión las huellas de manos inmundas. Docenas de botellas
vacías chocaban entre sí por los rincones ó rodaban con el movimiento de
la goleta. Uno de los libros de medicina del Doctor estaba allí, abierto
sobre la mesa, con un buen número de hojas arrancadas, de seguro para
usarlas en encender las pipas con ellas. Y en medio de todo aquello la
humeante lámpara enviaba aún su resplandor, pálido, casi tan oscuro como
la sombra misma.
Bajé á la bodega: los barriles todos habían ya concluído, y en cuanto á
las botellas era sorprendente el número de ellas que habían sido
vaciadas y tiradas luego. Era evidente que desde que el motín comenzó ni
uno solo de aquellos hombres había estado en su juicio.
Registrando aquí y allá me encontré una botella con un poco de _cognac_
para Hands. Para mí, tomé algunos bizcochos, frutas en vinagre, un gran
racimo de uvas y una tajada de queso. Con estas provisiones me presenté
de nuevo sobre cubierta, coloqué mi parte á salvo, tras la cabeza del
timón, fuera del alcance del timonel, avancé á proa en donde se
guardaba el agua, sacié allí mi sed concienzudamente y entonces, y sólo
hasta entonces, fuí á Hands para darle su _cognac_.
Yo creo que debe haber bebido un cuarto de litro por lo menos antes de
que hubiera apartado la botella de sus labios. Entonces dijo:
--¡Ah! ¡voto al infierno! ¡un poco de ésto era lo que yo quería!
Oído aquello me senté tranquilamente en el lugar que había escogido y
comencé á regalarme el paladar con aquel inesperado almuerzo.
--¿Se siente Vd. muy mal?, le pregunté.
--Si aquel Doctor estuviera á bordo--contestó con una voz mitad gruñido
mitad ladrido--si él estuviera aquí, yo estaría sano en dos patadas.
Pero, ¡el demonio y su cola! yo no tengo suerte... ¡de veras no, no!...
y eso, y no más eso es lo que me pasa. Por lo que hace al "agua-dulce"
ese, ya _se enfrió_ de esta hecha, añadió señalando con el dedo al
hombre del birrete rojo. Bueno, ¿y qué?... ¡al cabo que ése ni era
marino, ni nada!... ¡Vamos!... y ahora que caigo... tú ¿de dónde has
brotado aquí?
--Amigo, le contesté, he venido á bordo á tomar posesión de este buque,
y así es que, hasta nuevas órdenes, se servirá Vd. considerarme como su
Capitán.
Al oir esto me miró de una manera demasiado agria, pero no contestó
palabra. Algo de su color natural había vuelto á sus mejillas, si bien
continuaba con una gran apariencia de enfermedad y aún proseguía
resbalándose y volteando, según que el buque se iba para un lado ó para
otro.
--Por lo pronto, amigo Hands, continué yo, no me place ver esta bandera
izada en el tope de mis mástiles; así es que, con su permiso, procedo á
arriarla acto continuo. De eso á nada, prefiero nada.
Esquivando de nuevo los golpes del botalón, fuíme derecho á las
correderas del pabellón, tiré de ellas hacia abajo, abatiendo la
pirática bandera negra, y no bien la tuve entre mis manos, la arrojé al
mar resueltamente.
--¡Viva el Rey!, grité entonces agitando en el aire mi birrete. ¡Ha
concluído aquí el Capitán Silver!
Hands continuó observándome con cierto aire mordaz, aunque á
hurtadillas, sin levantar, empero, la barba que seguía apoyada sobre el
pecho. Un rato después añadió:
--Me parece, Capitán Hawkins, que tendrá Vd. necesidad de alguna ayuda
para bajar á tierra, ¿no es verdad? ¿Pues qué le parecería á Vd. que nos
entendiéramos?
--Me parece, muy bien, amigo Hands; con toda mi alma: hable Vd.
Y diciendo esto me entregué de nuevo á mi comida con el mayor apetito.
--Ese hombre, comenzó el timonel apuntando débilmente al cadáver, según
entiendo, se llamaba O'Brien y era un rematado irlandés; ese hombre,
como decía, y yo, desplegamos las velas con el objeto de llevarnos la
goleta á su lugar otra vez. ¡Pero ahora, qué! ahora ya se _enfrió_, y
está allí tan tirante como un pantoque, por lo cual lo que yo digo es
que quién va ahora á gobernar el buque: eso es lo que yo no veo. Si yo
no le doy á Vd. mi ayuda, no es Vd. el que podrá llevar la goleta, ó
nada entiendo yo de goletas ni de marina. Bueno; pues la cosa es esta:
Vd. me asegura mi comida y mi bebida, y una corbata vieja ó cualquiera
cosa para vendar mi herida y yo le diré cómo se ha de llevar el buque.
Me parece que no puede ser más redondo el negocio que propongo.
--Le diré á Vd. una cosa, Maese Hands, prorrumpí yo; mi intención no es
volver _La Española_ á su antiguo ancladero, sino llevarla á la bahía
del Norte y acercarla allí á la playa tranquilamente.
--Bueno, ya lo entiendo, gritó Hands. Me parece que yo no soy un haragán
tan endemoniado, después de todo. Yo bien sé entender las cosas como
son, ¡digo que sí! Yo ya traté de sacar el pie adelante y no pude: pues
ahora le toca á Vd. Capitán Hawkins. Vd. ha ganado la partida. ¿Conque á
la Bahía del Norte? Pues vamos á ella; yo no tengo que andar escogiendo,
¡digo que no! Le ayudaré á Vd. á llevar el buque, aunque vayamos á
fondear á la Playa de los Ajusticiados. ¡Por cien mil diablos que sí!
Me pareció que aquel hombre no iba muy desatinado en su resolución.
Cerramos nuestro trato en el acto mismo y, á los tres minutos, _La
Española_ ceñía gallardamente el viento á lo largo de la costa de la
isla con muy buenas esperanzas de voltear la punta Norte á eso de medio
día y de bajar de nuevo en dirección de la Bahía antes de la pleamar, á
fin de poder, á ese tiempo, orillarla en punto seguro y aguardar hasta
que el reflujo nos permitiera bajar á tierra.
Abandoné, entonces, por algún rato la caña del timón y bajé á la cámara
para buscar en mi maleta de á bordo una suave mascada de mi madre, con
la cual, y con mi ayuda personal, Hands se vendó una gran herida que
había recibido en el muslo y que todavía le sangraba. Con este alivio y
después de haber comido un poco y dar un trago ó dos más de _cognac_, el
timonel comenzó á reanimarse muy visiblemente, se sentó ya derecho,
habló más claro y más alto, y, en una palabra, parecía otro hombre
positivamente.
La brisa nos ayudó de una manera admirable. _La Española_ se deslizaba
ante ella con la ligereza de un pájaro; la costa de la isla corría, en
apariencia, á nuestro lado, y á cada momento cambiaba la decoración que
se presentaba á nuestra vista. Muy pronto dejamos atrás los terrenos
altos y bordeando por una costa baja y arenosa sembrada de un pinar no
muy espeso, que antes de mucho dejamos también á nuestra espalda,
volteamos, al fin, la punta de la escabrosa montaña que limita la isla
por el Norte.
Sentíame yo sobre manera engreído con mi nuevo carácter de Capitán de
buque, y no menos contento con el tiempo claro y favorable que hacía, al
par que con el variado panorama que mis ojos iban gozando sobre las
costas. Tenía á la sazón agua suficiente, excelente comida, y por no
dejar, mi conciencia, que no había cesado de remorderme por mi
deserción, estaba ya harto sosegada pensando en la gran conquista que
había hecho. Me había parecido que no me quedaba cosa alguna que desear,
á no ser por los ojos del timonel que me seguían en todas mis maniobras
con una mirada burlona, y por la sonrisa extraña que aparecía en sus
labios incesantemente. Era aquella una sonrisa que llevaba en sí una
mezcla de dolor y de maldad, huraña sonrisa de viejo, montaraz y
agreste. Pero, además de eso, su semblante dejaba traslucir una
expresión de escarnio, una sombra de no sé qué traidores pensamientos
que bullían en su cabeza, pues, mientras yo trabajaba, él, con su mañoso
disimulo, espiaba, y espiaba y espiaba sin cesar.

CAPÍTULO XXVI
ISRAEL HANDS
El viento, que parecía servirnos al pensamiento, cambió al Oeste. Esto
facilitó muchísimo nuestro curso, de la punta Noreste de la isla hacia
la embocadura de la Bahía septentrional. Sólo que, como no nos era
posible anclar, y no nos atrevíamos á orillarnos hasta que el reflujo
hubiera bajado bien, nos encontramos con tiempo de sobra. El timonel me
dijo lo que debía hacer para poner el buque á la capa; después de dos ó
tres ensayos desgraciados logré el objeto, y entonces los dos nos
sentamos en silencio á tomar una nueva comida.
Hands fué el primero que rompió el silencio diciéndome con su mofadora y
sardónica sonrisilla:
--Oiga Vd., Capitán. Aquí está rodándose de un lado para otro mi viejo
camarada O'Brien. ¿No le parece á Vd. que sería bueno que lo echara Vd.
á los pescados? Yo no soy muy delicado ni muy escrupuloso, por lo
regular, ni me pica la conciencia por haberle cortado las ganas de hacer
conmigo un picadillo; pero, al mismo tiempo, no me parece que ese trozo
sea un adorno muy bonito, ¿Qué dice Vd. de eso?
--Digo, le contesté, que ni tengo la fuerza suficiente para hacer eso,
ni es de mi gusto semejante tarea. Por lo que á mí hace, que se esté
allí.
--Esta _Española_, Jim, continuó tratando de disimular, es un buque muy
sin fortuna. Ya va una porción de hombres matados en pocos días, una
porción de pobrecillos marineros muertos y desaparecidos desde que Vd. y
yo tomamos pasaje á bordo de ella en Brístol. Nunca en mi perra vida me
he metido en un buque tan de mala suerte. Y si no, aquí está ese pobre
O'Brien; ya también se ha _enfriado_, ¿no es verdad? Bueno; pues lo
único que yo digo es esto: yo no soy ningún estudiante y Vd. es un
chicuelo muy leído y escribido que sabría sacarme de dudas, ¿El que se
muere, se muere para de una vez, ó puede revivir algún día?
--Amigo Hands, le contesté, Vd. puede matar el cuerpo, pero no el
espíritu; esto ya debe Vd. saberlo bien. O'Brien está ahora en otro
mundo desde el cual puede que esté contemplándonos.
--¡Ah!, dijo él. Según ese pensamiento se me figura que matar gentes
viene á ser casi... vamos al decir... como tiempo perdido. Con todo y
eso, y por lo que yo tengo de experiencia, los _espíritus_ no cuentan ya
por mucho en el juego. Yo no les tengo maldito el recelo, Jim. Bueno;
pero por ahora ya ha hablado Vd. como un _dotor_ y creo que no se me
pondrá bravo si le pido que baje otra vez á la cámara y me traiga de
allá... pues... sí... con mil demonios, ¿por qué no?... me traiga una
botella de... de... no puedo atinar el nombre... una botella de vino,
vamos. Este _cognac_, Jim, es muy rasposo ahora y muy fuerte para mi
cabeza.
Ahora bien, la vacilación del timonel me parecía muy poco natural, y en
cuanto á su preferencia del vino sobre el _cognac_ la encontré de todo
punto increíble. Todo aquello me olía simplemente á pretexto. Lo que él
quería era que yo me ausentara de sobre cubierta; esto era claro como la
luz; pero, con qué objeto, esto era lo que yo no me podía imaginar. Sus
ojos esquivaban tenazmente los míos; sus miradas se paseaban de aquí
para allá, de arriba á abajo, ya con una ojeada al cielo, ya con otra de
soslayo al cadáver de O'Brien. Constantemente le veía sonreir ó sacar la
lengua de la manera más llena de embarazo, de suerte que un niño podría
haber conocido que aquel hombre meditaba alguna engañifa. Pronto estuve
con mi respuesta, sin embargo, porque no se me ocultó de qué lado estaba
mi conveniencia y que, además, con un sujeto tan completamente estúpido,
me era muy fácil ocultar mis sospechas hasta el fin.
--¿Quiere Vd. vino?, le dije. Pues nada más fácil. ¿Lo quiere Vd. rojo ó
blanco?
--Pues mire Vd., se me figura que maldita la diferencia, camarada, me
replicó. Con tal de que sea fortalecedor y mucho ¿qué me importa el
color?
--Está bien, le contesté; le traeré á Vd. Oporto, amigo Hands. Pero
tengo que desenterrarlo del fondo de la bodega.
Dicho esto bajé la escalera de la carroza con todo el ruido que pude;
luego me descalcé rápidamente, y corrí por la galería que comunicaba la
cámara con la proa, subí por la escalera de la escotilla y saqué
cautelosamente la cabeza por la carroza de proa. Yo sabía que Hands no
se esperaba verme allí, pero no obstante tomé todas las precauciones
posibles, y en verdad que aquello me sirvió para confirmarme en mis
peores sospechas, que resultaron demasiado exactas.
Hands se había levantado de su posición, primero con las manos, luego
poniéndose de rodillas y después, aunque su pierna le hacía sufrir
agudamente al moverse y aun le oí articular más de un quejido, pudo, sin
embargo, arrastrarse con bastante prontitud sobre cubierta. En medio
minuto ya había llegado á los imbornales de babor y sacó de un rollo de
cuerda, un largo cuchillo, ó más bien, un estoque corto, descolorado y
sucio de sangre hasta la empuñadura. Hands contempló aquella arma por un
momento; hizo un gesto con la quijada inferior, probó la punta sobre la
palma de su mano y en seguida ocultándola apresuradamente en el pecho de
su jubón, se arrastró de nuevo hasta su lugar precedente, contra la
barandilla de popa.
No necesitaba saber más. Israel podía moverse, estaba armado, y si había
manifestado tal empeño en desembarazarse de mí, era claro que tramaba
hacerme víctima de sus maquinaciones. Qué sería lo que hiciera después:
si trataría de arrastrarse á todo lo largo de la isla hasta llegar al
campo de los piratas cerca de los pantanos, ó si intentaría hacer
señales, confiando en que sus camaradas podían llegar más pronto en su
auxilio, eran cosas que, por supuesto, me era imposible adivinar.
Sin embargo, de una cosa me creí seguro, y fué de que nuestro interés
común nos imponía la necesidad de orillar la goleta en un punto bastante
seguro y á cubierto, de manera que, llegada la ocasión, pudiera
ponérsela de nuevo á la mar con el menor trabajo y riesgo posibles.
Hasta lograr esto, consideré que mi vida no correría el menor peligro.
Pero mientras rumiaba estas ideas no había permanecido ocioso. Había
vuelto de nuevo, por el mismo camino, hasta la cámara, me calcé otra vez
apresuradamente, eché mano, al acaso, á la primera botella de vino que
se me presentó, y con ella para servirme de excusa hice mi reaparición
sobre cubierta.
Hands estaba allí, donde lo había dejado, todo encogido y anudado, con
los párpados caídos como si quisiera dar á entender que estaba bastante
débil para que le fuese dable soportar la luz. Sin embargo, al sentir
mis pasos, alzó la vista, rompió el cuello del frasco con la naturalidad
del hombre que está acostumbrado á hacer la misma operación con mucha
frecuencia y dió un gran sorbo con su frase favorita "¡buena suerte!" En
seguida permaneció quieto por algún tiempo, y luego sacando un paquete
de tabaco me rogó que le cortara una tajadilla.
--Córteme Vd. un pedazo de eso, dijo; porque yo no tengo navaja y apenas
me siento con fuerza para menearme. ¡Ah, Jim, Jim, se me figura que
todos mis estayes se han reventado! Córteme un pedacillo, que se me
figura será ya el último, porque mi casco hace agua y creo que sin
remedio me voy á pique.
--Está bien, no me resisto á cortarle á Vd. su tabaco, pero si yo fuera
Vd. y me sintiera mal hasta ese extremo, crea Vd. que lo que haría sería
ponerme á pedir á Dios misericordia, como un buen cristiano.
--¿Por qué?, me preguntó. ¿Quiere Vd. decirme por qué?
--¿Cómo por qué?, exclamé yo. Hace un momento precisamente que me
preguntaba Vd. algo acerca de los que mueren. Vd. ha hecho traición á su
fe. Vd. ha vivido encenagado en el vicio, en la mentira y en la sangre.
Vd. tiene aún allí, rodando junto á sus pies, el cadáver de un hombre á
quien ha asesinado hace pocos instantes, ¿y todavía me pregunta Vd. por
qué?... ¡Pues por eso, amigo Hands, por todo eso!
Mi palabra llevaba impreso un sello de calor inusitado, gracias á que,
en el fondo, pensaba yo en aquel estilete que el rufián acababa de
ocultar en su jubón y con el cual se proponía dar buena cuenta de mí.
Él, por su parte, me vió, tomó un gran trago de vino y luego dijo con un
tono de solemnidad desusada:
--Durante treinta largos años he recorrido los mares, durante treinta
años he visto bueno y malo, mejor y peor, tiempo hermoso y horrendas
tempestades; víveres escasos á bordo; agua casi agotada, y zafarranchos
y rebeliones, y luchas, y muertes, y abordajes... ¡oh! ¡tantas cosas!...
Pues bien, lo único que no he visto en esos treinta años es que lo bueno
produzca nada bueno. El que pega primero es el afortunado y nada más.
Los muertos no muerden, Jim; esa es mi opinión, esa es mi fe, y así
sea...
Y cambiando instantáneamente de entonación prosiguió:
--Pero vamos allá. Creo que ya hemos perdido bastante el tiempo con esas
tonteras. La bajamar está bastante propicia en este momento. Siga Vd.
mis órdenes, Capitán Hawkins, y pronto atracaremos y estaremos listos
con la goleta.
Dicho y hecho: nos quedaban sólo dos millas escasas que recorrer, pero
la navegación era delicada porque el acceso á esta bahía del Norte no
solamente era estrecho y lleno de bancos de arena, sino que serpeaba de
Este á Oeste, de suerte que el buque tenía que ser listamente
maniobrado para hallar el paso. Creo que fuí, en aquella ocasión, un
subalterno pronto y bueno y estoy seguro también de que Hands era un
excelente piloto, porque el hecho es que pasamos y pasamos, recortando
diestramente los peligros, casi desflorando los arrecifes, con una
seguridad y una limpieza tales que positivamente daban gusto.
Acabábamos apenas de cruzar frente á los peñones de tierra, junto á
nosotros. Las playas de la Bahía Norte estaban tan densamente arboladas
como las del fondeadero del Sur, pero el espacio era más largo y más
estrecho, y más parecido á lo que era realmente, esto es, la
desembocadura de un río. Exactamente junto á nosotros, hacia el extremo
Sur, vimos los restos de un buque en el último período de destrucción.
Se advertía que aquel había sido un gran navío de tres palos, pero había
permanecido tan largo tiempo expuesto á los embates de los elementos,
que se veía orlado aquí y allá por enormes colgajos de algas marinas, y
sobre su cubierta enarenada habían arraigado las ramas de los arbustos
de la playa, que apretados y vigorosos, como si estuviesen en tierra,
florecían allí sin embarazo alguno. Era aquél un espectáculo triste,
pero él nos daba la seguridad de que el fondeadero era perfectamente
tranquilo y seguro.
--Ahora, dijo Hands, allí tenemos ya un banco á propósito para atracar
un buque: arena limpia y plana, jamás un soplo á flor de agua, árboles
en todo el derredor, y un montón de flores reventando en la cáscara de
aquel barco como en un jardín... ¿qué más queremos?
--Bien está, le repliqué, pero una vez atracados ó encallados, ¿cómo
hacemos para poner la goleta á flote otra vez?
--Muy fácil, me contestó. Largas un cabo allá, á la playa opuesta, á la
hora del reflujo, le das una vuelta en torno de uno de los pinos más
gruesos y traes la punta á bordo. Durante el reflujo, allí se está todo
quieto, pero viene la pleamar, lías tu cabo al cabrestante, todos á
bordo se ponen á las barras, dan dos ó tres vueltas y la goleta saldrá á
flote tan dulcemente como por su voluntad. Y ahora, muchacho, pára. Ya
estamos cerca de nuestro banco y vamos demasiado aprisa... Un poco á
estribor... ¡ eso es!... firme... ¡á estribor!... ahora un cuarto á
babor... firme... ¡firme!
Así daba él sus voces de mando, que yo obedecía casi sin tomar aliento,
hasta que, por último, gritó repentinamente:
--¡Bien, muy bien!... ¡Orza!
Obedecí una vez más y con todas mis fuerzas alcé el timón: _La Española_
dió una vuelta rápidamente y con el branque á tierra se deslizó
ligeramente hacia la arbolada playa.
El entusiasmo de éstas últimas maniobras había sido causa de que me
olvidara un poco de espiar atentamente como hasta allí los movimientos
todos del timonel. En aquel mismo instante estaba todavía tan vivamente
interesado en ver al buque tocar tierra, que hasta había olvidado el
peligro que se cernía sobre mi cabeza, y permanecía yo de pie, embobado,
sobre la balaustra de estribor, contemplando los suaves escarceos del
agua que se despeinaban contra la proa y costados de nuestro buque. Pude
haber caído allí, lisa y llanamente, sin un solo esfuerzo para
defenderme, á no ser por una inquietud repentina que se apoderó de mí y
me obligó á volver la cabeza. Tal vez había llegado hasta mí algún
ligero crujido; tal vez de reojo ví su sombra moviéndose hacia mí; tal
vez no fué aquello más que un movimiento instintivo como el de un gato,
pero el caso es que, al volver la cabeza, ví allí á Hands á medio camino
en dirección de mí, con la daga, desnuda ya, en su mano derecha.
Ambos debemos haber lanzado un grito simultáneo cuando nuestros ojos se
encontraron, pero si el mío fué el alarido del terror, el suyo no fué
más que el espantable bramido de un toro salvaje á punto de embestir. En
el mismo instante Hands avanzó hacía mí, y yo salté de lado hacia la
proa. Al ejecutar este movimiento dejé caer la caña del timón que saltó
violentamente á sotavento, y creo que ésto salvó mi vida porque el
madero aquel, golpeó á Hands con fuerza sobre el pecho y lo detuvo, por
un momento, paralizándolo por completo.
Antes de que hubiera podido volver en sí de semejante golpe, yo había
podido ya salirme del rincón en que me había acorralado, y puéstome en
vía de tener toda la cubierta á mi disposición para escabullirme. Á proa
del palo mayor me detuve, saqué una pistola de mi bolsillo, apunté
fríamente, á pesar de que él había ya vuelto sobre sus pasos y se
dirigía una vez más sobre mí; preparé mi arma y oprimí el fiador.... El
martillo cayó, pero no hubo ni relámpago ni detonación: ¡el cebo se
había inutilizado con el agua del mar! No pude menos que condenar mi
negligencia... ¿cómo es que no me había ocurrido, mucho antes, recargar
y cebar de nuevo mis únicas armas? De haberlo hecho así no me hubiera
visto reducido á ser un mero corderillo correteando frente á su
carnicero.
Herido como estaba, era asombroso cuán de prisa podía moverse; con su
enmarañado cabello cayéndole sobre el rostro y con su cara misma tan
enrojecida por la furia y la precipitación como una bandera de degüello.
Desgraciadamente no me quedaba tiempo de ensayar mi otra pistola; esto
era ya imposible, y además tenía la certeza de que debía estar tan
inutilizada como la otra. Una cosa me apareció clara y fuera de duda y
era que yo debía hacer algo que no fuese simplemente retroceder ante él,
porque, de seguirlo haciendo así, muy pronto me acorralaría á proa como
un momento antes me tenía cogido á popa. Y una vez acorralado, y con
nueve ó diez pulgadas de aquella daga dentro de mi cuerpo, podría decir
que habían concluído mis aventuras en este lado de la eternidad. Coloqué
las palmas de mis manos contra el palo mayor que era bastante grueso y
esperé, con el alma en un hilo como suele decirse.
Notando Hands que mi intención era sacarle las vueltas, él también se
detuvo y un momento ó dos se pasaron en fingir él ataques y movimientos
que yo eludía con la mayor ligereza. Era aquella la repetición de un
juego que muchas veces había yo jugado en las rocas de la caleta del
Black Hill; pero, con toda seguridad, jamás lo hice con el corazón
saltándome tan precipitadamente como entonces. Sin embargo, como acabo
de decirlo, aquello era un juego de muchachos, en la forma, si no en el
fondo, y creí que podría fácilmente llevar la ventaja en él, muchacho
como yo era, sobre un hombre más viejo que yo y con un muslo herido. Á
la verdad, mi valor había comenzado á renacer de tal manera que ya me
permitía algunos pensamientos arrojados sobre el fin probable de
aquella lucha; y eso que, aun admitiendo la seguridad que yo tenía de
entretener la maniobra aquella por largo tiempo, no veía una posibilidad
verdadera de escape definitivo.
Pues bien, en tal estado las cosas, _La Española_ tocó repentinamente el
banco á que la dirigíamos; se bamboleó, fué rozando la arena por un
momento y luego, rápida como una exhalación, se inclinó sobre babor
recostándose de tal manera que la superficie de la cubierta formaba un
ángulo de cuarenta y cinco grados. El chapuzón levantó una oleada que se
coló por los imbornales y se estancó luego en un charco entre la
cubierta y la balaustra.
Tanto Hands como yo rodamos en un segundo, casi juntos, hacia los
imbornales, revolviéndose con nosotros el cadáver de O'Brien, con su
gorro encarnado y sus brazos siempre en cruz. Tan juntos rodamos
ciertamente que mi cabeza se encontró enredada con los pies del timonel,
golpeando en ellos con un sonido que hizo que mis dientes chocaran
tiritando á causa del horror. Pero con golpe y todo, yo fuí el primero
en estar en pie, pues Hands estaba enredado estrechamente con los brazos
y piernas de su víctima. La inclinación repentina del buque hacía que su
cubierta fuera ya inútil para correr sobre ella. Tenía, pues, precisión
de buscarme alguna nueva vía de escape, y eso en aquel instante mismo,
porque mi adversario se había ya desligado del muerto y estaba, de
nuevo, en pie, casi sobre mí. Rápido como el pensamiento salté sobre los
obenques de mesana, avancé una mano sobre la otra y no tomé siquiera
aliento hasta que me encontré sentado en uno de los baos de gavia.
Á la rapidez con que obré debí mi salvación; la daga había golpeado á
medio pie de distancia, debajo de mí, mientras mi trabajo de ascensión
iba en proceso; pero al último, allí estaba Israel Hands, con la boca
abierta y con la cara vuelta á mí, en una actitud que me hacía verle
como la perfecta estatua de la sorpresa y la contrariedad.
Comprendiendo entonces que podía disponer de algunos instantes, no los
desperdicié, sino que al punto cambié el cebo de mi pistola, y ya con
una lista para servicio, doblé las seguridades de mi defensa cargando de
nuevo y cebando con igual cuidado la otra.
Aquella nueva operación mía impresionó á Hands en un alto grado;
comenzaba á ver que el juego se le volvía en contra y así fué que,
después de una corta vacilación, saltó él también pesadamente sobre los
obenques, y poniéndose la daga entre los dientes para dejarse las manos
libres, comenzó una ascensión lenta y penosa para él. Bastante tiempo y
quejidos le costaba el arrastrar consigo aquella pierna herida, así es
que tuve tiempo suficiente para concluir mis aprestos de defensa antes
de que él hubiera avanzado siquiera un tercio del camino que tenía que
recorrer. Empuñé entonces una pistola en cada mano y apuntándole con
ellas le dije:
--Un paso más hacia acá, amigo Hands, y le vuelo á Vd. la tapa de los
sesos. Ya he aprendido de Vd. aquello de que "los muertos no muerden,"
añadí con una entonación de burla.
Como por encanto se detuvo en su marcha. Ví por el movimiento de su
rostro que estaba tratando de pensar, pero en aquel cerebro estúpido
pensar era un procedimiento tan lento y laborioso que, sintiéndome muy
seguro, no pude evitar el reirme de él con todas mis ganas. Por último,
no sin tragar una ó dos veces, habló, conservando en su semblante las
mismas señales de perplejidad. Para poder hablar había tenido que
quitarse la daga de la boca, pero en todo lo demás permanecía sin
cambiar de actitud.
--Jim, díjome; confieso que hemos andado haciendo tonteras tanto Vd.
como yo, sí señor. Es preciso que hagamos las paces. Yo le hubiera
cogido á Vd. con toda seguridad á no ser por esa barrera en que se ha
colado. Pero no tengo suerte, amigo, ¡digo que no! Se me figura, pues,
que tengo que rendirme, lo cual es cosa dura, ya lo entiende Vd., para
un marino viejo, tratándose de capitular con un chicuelillo como Vd.,
Jim.
Estaba yo gozándome en esas palabras y sintiéndome allí tan satisfecho y
orgulloso como un gallo sobre una pared, cuando en un instante casi
inapreciable ví que echaba hacia atrás la mano derecha y que la
levantaba de nuevo sobre el hombro. Algo como una flecha silbó en el
viento, experimenté un golpe horrible, un tormento agudo y me sentí
clavado contra el mástil por el hombro. En la espantosa sorpresa y dolor
indecible de aquel momento, no sabré decir si fué con mi voluntad ó, lo
que es más probable, con un movimiento inconsciente, y sin hacer
puntería alguna, pero el hecho es que mis dos pistolas dieron fuego, se
me escaparon de las manos y cayeron sobre cubierta. Empero no fueron
ellas las únicas que cayeron. Con el impulso que hizo su brazo derecho
para lanzar la daga, el timonel relajó la presión de su mano izquierda
sobre el obenque y, no sin lanzar un espantoso grito de terror, cayó de
cabeza adentro del agua.

CAPÍTULO XXVII
"¡PIEZAS DE Á OCHO!"
Debido á la gran inclinación en que había quedado la goleta, los
mástiles se veían suspensos en gran parte encima del agua; así es que,
desde mi asiento en el bao de las gavias, yo no veía debajo de mí sino
la superficie de la bahía. Hands, que todavía no iba tan alto, estaba,
en consecuencia, más cerca del buque, y su caída se efectuó pasando su
cuerpo entre mí y la balaustra. Por una vez le ví alzarse á flor de agua
en una mezcla de espuma y sangre y luego se hundió de nuevo para no
reaparecer más á flote. Tan luego como el agua se serenó pude verle
tendido sobre la limpia y brillante arena del fondo, y como protegido
por la sombra que los costados del buque arrojaban sobre el agua. Uno ó
dos peces azotaron su cuerpo al paso. Una vez ú otra con el ondear del
agua parecía como si se moviera un poco, como si estuviese tratando de
levantarse. Pero bien muerto estaba para tales maniobras, habiéndole
herido una de mis balas y ahogádose en seguida, por lo cual en poco
tiempo ya no fué sino alimento de peces en el mismo sitio en que había
meditado acabar conmigo.
No bien estuve seguro de esto cuando comencé á sentirme enfermo,
desfallecido, terrificado. Mi sangre caliente corría copiosamente sobre
el pecho y la espalda. En el lugar en que la daga me había clavado al
mástil, la sentía yo arder como si fuera un hierro candente. Y sin
embargo, por grande que fuese ese sufrimiento no era él lo que más me
acongojaba, pareciéndome que podría muy bien sufrirlo sin quejarme: lo
que me enloquecía era el horror que me inspiraba la idea de que podía de
un momento á otro desprenderme del bao y caer en el agua, todavía mal
sosegada, junto al cadáver del timonel.
Me así al mástil con ambas manos, con tal fuerza que las uñas me
punzaban, y cerré los ojos como para no ver el peligro que corría.
Gradualmente, empero, mi ánimo volvió, mis pulsos agitados se aquietaron
un poco y una vez más me sentí en posesión de mí mismo.
Mi primer pensamiento fué sacar la daga, pero ó estaba muy adherida, ó
mi fuerza no era suficiente, por lo cual desistí con un violento
estremecimiento. ¡Cosa extraña! aquel estremecimiento hizo lo que yo no
pude hacer. El puñal, en resumidas cuentas, había venido muy á punto de
errar el golpe; tan á punto que apenas me había cogido la piel, por lo
cual la convulsión aquella bastó para sacar el arma de la herida. La
sangre se escapaba más de prisa, esto era evidente, pero en cambio yo
era de nuevo dueño de mí mismo y sólo quedaba clavado al mástil por el
saco y la camisa.
Con una sacudida violenta desprendí estos últimos y acto continuo bajé
sobre cubierta por los obenques de estribor. Por nada en el mundo me
habría atrevido, conmovido como estaba, á bajar por los mismos obenques
por donde subí, desde los cuales Hands había caído directamente al
agua.
Bajéme en el acto á la cámara y arreglé mi herida como Dios me dió á
entender; sentía á causa de ella un dolor bastante agudo y todavía
sangraba en abundancia, pero no era ni profunda ni peligrosa, ni sentí
que me embargara el libre movimiento de mi brazo. Eché luego una ojeada
en mi derredor, y bien convencido ya de que el buque, en cierto sentido,
era ya enteramente mío, comencé á pensar en desembarazarlo de su último
pasajero, ó sea del cadáver de O'Brien.
Este había caído recargado, á causa de la sacudida del buque, contra la
balaustrada, quedando en pie y en una posición horrible, parecida un
tanto á la de un vivo, pero bien diverso de un cuerpo con vida en el
color y en el donaire, ¡oh! ¡bien diferente! En aquella postura me era
muy fácil encontrar el medio de realizar lo que yo quería, y como ya la
costumbre de las aventuras trágicas había concluído por hacerme perder
todo miedo á los cadáveres, cogí aquel por la cintura como si hubiera
sido un saco de salvado y haciendo un buen esfuerzo lo arrojé al agua.
La víctima de Hands cayó al mar con un sonoro chapuzón; y el gorro
encarnado salió á flote y quedó nadando sobre la superficie. No bien la
agitación del agua se hubo calmado, pude ver al horrible muerto yaciendo
sobre el cuerpo del timonel y ambos meciéndose suavemente con el meneo
del manso fondo de la bahía. O'Brien, aunque todavía bastante joven, era
en extremo calvo, y yo veía muy bien aquella su cabeza desnuda
descansando sobre las rodillas del hombre que lo había asesinado, en
tanto que, rápidos y nerviosos, los peces pasaban azotando aquellas
masas inertes.
Solo ya, solo enteramente, estaba sobre la goleta; la marea había
vuelto y el sol estaba á tan pocos grados de su ocaso que las sombras de
los pinos de la costa occidental comenzaban ya á cruzar la anchura del
fondeadero y á caer sobre la cubierta de _La Española_. La brisa
vespertina se había desatado, y aun cuando muy á cubierto con la colina
de los dos picos hacia el Este, las jarcias empezaban ya á silbar un
poco, y las sueltas lonas á azotar de un lado para otro.
Comencé entonces á temer algún peligro para el buque: arrié los foques á
toda prisa y los eché, sin gran trabajo, sobre cubierta; pero en cuanto
á la vela mayor, esta era ya materia mucho más difícil. Por supuesto que
al ladearse el navío, el botalón se había colgado hacia afuera, al
extremo de que su remate y uno ó dos pies de la vela colgaban sumergidos
en el agua. Me pareció que esta circunstancia lo hacía todavía mucho más
peligroso, y añádase aún que la compresión era tan fuerte que medio
temía yo hacer algo en el asunto. Por último me resolví; saqué mi navaja
y corté la cuerda de la verga. El peñol se abatió instantáneamente y una
gran curva de lona, ya suelta, flotó esparcida sobre el agua; desde
aquel momento, abatido como lo deseaba, ya no me era posible menear la
cargadera: esto era todo cuanto estaba en mi poder ejecutar. Por lo
demás, _La Española_ debía confiar, como yo mismo, en nuestra buena
estrella.
Entre tanto, toda la bahía estaba ya sumergida en la sombra del pinar:
recuerdo que los últimos rayos del sol acababan de penetrar por un
pequeño claro del boscaje y habían brillado como joyas resplandecientes
sobre la diadema de flores de aquel destrozado casco de navío, con sus
arbustos, líquenes y musgos marinos. El fresco era ya penetrante, la
bajamar iba rápidamente hacia afuera del ancladero, y la goleta quedaba
más y más á cada momento descansando sobre las extremidades de los baos.
Subí en cuatro pies en dirección de proa y lancé una ojeada en torno
mío. Me convencí de que el fondo de agua que quedaba era insignificante
y así fué que, cogiéndome con ambas manos á la cortada guindaleza, por
una última precaución, me dejé deslizar suavemente hacia afuera del
buque. El agua apenas me cubría las piernas, la arena era firme,
cubierta con las ondulantes acentuaciones de la agitación suave de las
aguas, por lo cual salí por fin á tierra, lleno de alegría, dejando á
_La Española_ recostada sobre sí misma, con su vela mayor bañándose
ampliamente sobre la superficie de las olas. En aquel mismo instante el
sol se ponía definitivamente en Occidente y la brisa murmuraba
suavemente en el crepúsculo, jugueteando entre los ondulantes pinos.
Por último, y á lo menos, me veía fuera del mar y no tornaba, por
cierto, con las manos vacías. Allí estaba la goleta, libre al fin de
todo pirata, y lista para que nuestros hombres la tripularan una vez más
y se hicieran á la mar de nuevo. Nada, por consiguiente, estaba más en
mis intenciones que el volver, á casa como quien dice, esto es, á la
estacada, y contar allí con orgullo mis hazañas y aventuras. No sería
extraño que se me riñera un poco por mi truhanería, pero el haber
recapturado _La Española_ era una elocuente y significativa respuesta
que, lo aguardaba así, obligaría al Capitán Smollet á confesar que no
había yo perdido el tiempo.
Raciocinando de este modo, y con el ánimo levantado en gran manera,
púseme en camino de lo que he llamado mi casa, que era el reducto en
que estaban mis compañeros. Me acordaba bien que el más oriental de los
ríos que desembocan en la bahía del Capitán Kidd, corría desde la
montaña de los dos picos, sobre mi izquierda, por lo cual enderecé el
rumbo en aquella dirección, seguro de poder cruzar el río en el punto en
que era aún angosto. El bosque no era nada espeso y siguiendo, sin
desviarme, la línea más baja de la falda del cerro, pronto había
volteado su extremidad y no mucho rato después ya había vadeado, con el
agua sólo á media pierna, la corriente del río.
Esto me puso muy cerca del punto en que encontré á Ben Gunn, el hombre
_aislado_ y, por lo mismo, mi marcha fué ya más circunspecta teniendo
siempre un ojo abierto para cada lado. La luz del crepúsculo iba ya
cediendo el campo á las grandes sombras de la noche, y no bien hube
franqueado el espacio necesario para poder ver entre la abertura que
forman los dos picos, llegó hasta mi vista la ondulante claridad de un
fuego que se destacaba sobre el fondo del horizonte. Supuse que el
hombre de la isla estaba allí cocinando su cena al resplandor de una
clara y alegre hoguera. Pero no dejaba de maravillarme que tan sin
cuidado ni precaución alguna se mostrara, porque si yo veía aquel fulgor
¿no era probable que también llegara hasta los ojos de Silver en su
campamento de la playa, entre los marjales?
Gradualmente la noche había llegado más y más negra; y en las tinieblas
que me envolvían, lo único que yo podía hacer era guiarme, y eso no muy
seguramente, hacia mi destino, teniendo á mi espalda la doble cima de la
altura, y á mi derecha la mole del "Vigía" que cada momento se
desvanecían más y más en los nimbos de la oscuridad. Las estrellas eran
escasas y pálidas y en el terreno bajo que yo recorría me era imposible
evitar el enredarme al paso con zarzas y matorrales ó caer en
sinuosidades arenosas.
De pronto cierta claridad inesperada cayó cerca de mí. Alcé la vista; el
vislumbre pálido de los rayos lunares se dilataba sobre la cima del
"Vigía," y muy poco después ví algo como un globo de plata alzándose
lentamente de sobre las copas de la arboleda: era la luna que salía.
Con esta ayuda pude ya franquear más fácilmente lo que me faltaba de
andar, y á veces marcando á paso natural, á veces corriendo, me acercaba
á cada momento más y más á la estacada. Sin embargo, como ya me
encontraba en el bosque que limita la fortaleza, no me pareció tan fuera
de propósito el moderar mi paso y marchar con bastante precaución, pues
cierto que hubiera sido un triste fin de mis aventuras el verme
atravesado por la bala de un centinela de nuestro campo que hiciera
fuego sobre mí, sin conocerme.
La luna se alzaba más y más alto; su luz se desparramaba ya aquí y
acullá sobre los espacios que la arboleda del bosque dejaba limpios, y,
cosa extraña, frente á mí apareció un resplandor de tinte diferente,
entre los pinos. Aquel brillo era rojo y ardiente, pero de vez en cuando
se oscurecía, como si fuera un brasero sofocado de tiempo en tiempo por
la humareda.
Por vida mía que no podía yo atinar con lo que aquello pudiera ser.
Pero al fin y al cabo llegué á los límites de la parte desarbolada. La
extremidad occidental estaba á la sazón inundada con la claridad del
astro de la noche; pero la parte restante lo mismo que el reducto
todavía quedaban envueltos en la sombra, si bien con una que otra lista
de luz que lograba caer allí á través de la masa espesa del follaje. Al
otro extremo de la casa una inmensa hoguera había ardido hasta tornarse
en rescoldo puro, y su reverbero acentuadamente rojo contrastaba en gran
manera con la dulce palidez de la luna. Empero no había por todo aquello
un alma que se moviera, ni el menor ruido interrumpía la cadencia suave
y monótona del soplo de la brisa.
Me detuve presa de la más grande extrañeza, y quizás con algo de terror
en mi corazón. No había sido costumbre nuestra, por cierto, el encender
grandes lumbradas, pues precisamente una de las órdenes más terminantes
del Capitán era que economizáramos la leña, por lo cual comencé á temer
que algo malo había sucedido allí durante mi ausencia.
Me deslicé con cautela dando vuelta por la esquina oriental,
manteniéndome resguardado en la oscuridad, y en el lugar que juzgué más
á propósito por ser la sombra más espesa salvé resueltamente la
empalizada.
Para aumentar mis seguridades me puse á recorrer el trayecto que me
separaba del ángulo del reducto, andando sobre las rodillas y las manos,
sin hacer el más pequeño ruido. Cuando ya estuve bastante cerca, mi
corazón se dilató con una expansión de gozo indecible. Lo que la causaba
no era un rumor que pueda llamarse, de por sí, agradable en manera
alguna, y aún recuerdo haberme quejado de él en más de una ocasión; pero
en aquella lo percibí como si hubiera sido el eco de una música
deliciosa. ¿Qué era ello? ¡Ah! nada menos que el concierto sonoro de
los ronquidos de mis amigos, durmiendo todos apaciblemente. El grito del
centinela nocturno de á bordo que nos anunciaba á las altas horas "¡todo
va bien!" jamás sonó más agradablemente á mi oído.
Por lo pronto, en lo que no cabía la menor duda era en que en mi campo
la vigilancia era de todo punto detestable. Si Silver y sus hombres
fueran en aquel instante los que estuvieran cayendo sobre mis amigos, de
seguro que ni uno solo vería levantarse la luz del nuevo día. Eso era lo
que influía, pensé yo, el tener al Capitán herido; raciocinio que me
hizo reprocharme una vez más el haberlos dejado en aquella situación
peligrosa, con tan pocas personas hábiles para montar la guardia.
Á la sazón ya había llegado á la entrada y estaba allí, de pie. Todo era
oscuridad adentro y mis ojos no podían distinguir nada en la densa
tiniebla de aquel recinto. En cuanto á oir, ya se comprenderá que en
aquel punto era, para mí, mucho más distinta y perceptible la música de
los ronquidos. Á ella se añadía, aunque fuese del todo insignificante,
un ruido ligero como de alas ó picoteo casi imperceptible.
Con las manos hacia adelante avancé resueltamente al interior. Mi
intento fué acostarme en mi lugar de costumbre, y, añadí riendo para mis
adentros, ¡cómo me voy á divertir viendo las caras que ponen mañana
cuando me vayan viendo!
Mi pie tropezó con algo que cedía á mi paso: era la pierna de uno de
aquellos descuidados dormilones que, á mi contacto, no hizo más que
murmurar y volverse del otro lado; pero sin despertar.
Pero en aquel instante, y como partiendo del rincón más oscuro de la
pieza, una voz chillona y aguda prorrumpió desaforadamente:
--¡Piezas de á ocho! ¡piezas de á ocho! ¡piezas de á ocho! ¡piezas de á
ocho! ¡piezas de á ocho! ¡piezas de á ocho!... y continuaba así
incansable y sin respiración como una carraca.
¡Aquel era _Capitán Flint_, el loro verde de Silver!
Él era el que producía el rumor ligero que yo escuché, picoteando una
corteza de los maderos del muro.
Él era el que, ejerciendo una vigilancia mucho mejor que la de una
criatura humana, acababa de anunciar mi llegada con su incansable
refrán.
No tuve el tiempo siquiera indispensable para recobrarme. Al grito agudo
y penetrante del loro todos los roncadores se despertaron y se pusieron
en pie, escuchándose al punto la voz imponente de Silver que, con el
acompañamiento obligado de una insolencia, gritó:
--¿Quién va?
Me volví para correr, pero dí contra una persona; híceme á un lado para
buscar nuevo camino y caí en los brazos de otra que, por su parte me
estrechó violentamente teniéndome bien apretado.
--Trae una antorcha, Dick; dijo Silver cuando mi apresamiento estaba
asegurado.
Entonces uno de aquellos hombres salió del reducto y momentos después
volvió con un hachón encendido.

PARTE VI
_EL CAPITÁN SILVER_
CAPÍTULO XXVIII
EL CAMPO ENEMIGO
La claridad rojiza de la antorcha iluminando el interior de la cabaña,
me hizo ver que, cuanto de malo pude imaginar en aquellos momentos era,
por desgracia, demasiado cierto. Los piratas estaban en posesión del
reducto y de las provisiones: allí estaba la barriquilla de _cognac_;
allí las carnes saladas y los bizcochos como antes de mi ausencia y,
cosa que acrecentó infinitamente mi terror, ni la menor señal de un
prisionero. No era posible pensar otra cosa sino que todos habían
perecido y mi corazón se sintió angustiosamente oprimido al pensar que
yo no había estado allí para perecer con ellos.
Seis de los piratas quedaban allí únicamente: ni uno más sobrevivía.
Cinco estaban en pie, colorados, soñolientos y mal humorados por haberse
tenido que arrancar al sopor de la embriaguez. El sexto se había medio
incorporado nada más, sobre uno de los codos; estaba mortalmente pálido,
y el ensangrentado vendaje que rodeaba su cabeza daba á entender que
aquel hombre había sido recientemente herido, y aun más recientemente
curado. Recordé entonces al hombre que en el ataque de la estacada había
sido herido y escapádose por el bosque, y no me cupo duda de que éste
era el mismo.
El loro había saltado sobre el hombro de su amo, peinando y componiendo
su plumaje. En cuanto á Silver me pareció más pálido, y como más severo
que de ordinario. Todavía llevaba puesto el hermoso traje de paño que se
endosó el día de las conferencias, sólo que ahora estaba en extremo
manchado de arcilla y con bastantes desgarrones causados por las
espinosas zarzas de los bosques.
--¡El diablo me ayude!, exclamó. ¡Vaya una sorpresa! Conque aquí tenemos
á Jim Hawkins, entrando, así, como quien dice, sin cumplimientos, ¿eh?
¡Sea enhora buena! ¡Recibámosle como amigos!
Dicho esto se sentó sobre la barriquilla del _cognac_ y dió trazas de
componer y llenar su pipa.
--Dick, presta acá tu eslabón y tu yesca por un momento, dijo.
Y cuando ya tenía una buena lumbre, añadió:
--¡Esto te saldrá bien, chiquillo! Veamos, Dick, encaja esa antorcha en
el montón de la leña. Y Vds., amigos, pueden sentarse, no hay necesidad
de estarse allí de pie. El _Señor_ Hawkins los dispensará á Vds., no les
quepa duda. Conque sí, amigo Jim, aquí estás tú. ¡Qué sorpresa más grata
para tu viejo John! Yo siempre he dicho que tú eras vivo como un
zancudo, desde que te puse el ojo encima; pero la verdad, chico, esto le
saca el pie adelante á todos mis pronósticos!
Á todo esto, como se supondrá fácilmente, yo no contestaba una sola
palabra. Habíame reclinado contra uno de los muros y desde allí clavaba
mis ojos en los de Silver, con bastante descaro y resolución aparentes,
pero bien sabe Dios que, entre tanto, la más negra desesperación
envolvía mi alma por completo.
Silver dió una ó dos vigorosas fumadas á su pipa con la mayor
compostura, y acto continuo prosiguió:
--Ahora bien, Jim, puesto que ya estás aquí, voy á decirte algo de lo
que pienso. Yo siempre te Le querido, y siempre te he tomado por un
mozuelo de ánimo, y por el mismísimo retrato mío cuando era yo como tú,
muchacho y buen mozo. Yo siempre quise que tú fueras de los nuestros, y
que tomaras la parte que te correspondiera para que pudieses vivir y
morir siendo de veras persona. Ahora ya estás aquí, polluelo... ¡tanto
mejor! El Capitán Smollet es un buen marino, no cabe duda, tan bueno
como yo mismo lo sería, en cualquier tiempo, pero rigoroso en achaques
de disciplina. "El deber antes que todo," es su dicho favorito, y tiene
razón, con cien mil diablos. Pero héte aquí emancipado ya de tu Capitán.
El Doctor mismo que te quería tanto, lo tienes ahora enojado á muerte
contigo--"prófugo malagradecido"--dijo refiriéndose á tí. Así, pues, por
más vueltas que le des al asunto, el resultado es que tú ya no puedes ir
de nuevo á reunirte con los tuyos, porque ya ellos no te quieren y así,
á menos que te propongas encabezar una tercera fracción en la isla, para
lo cual tendrías el sentimiento de no tener más compañía que tu sombra,
tienes, por fuerza que alistarte bajo las banderas de tu viejo amigo
Silver.
Aquel discurso me hizo un grandísimo bien. Por él supe que mis amigos
aún vivían y, aun cuando, no desconfiaba yo de que fuera cierto, en
parte, lo que Silver decía acerca de los resentimientos del partido de
cámara, por mi deserción, me sentí mucho más consolado que afligido con
sus noticias.
--Nada te diré respecto de que estás en nuestras manos, continuó Silver.
Supongo que ninguna duda te cabrá sobre este particular. Pero, mira tú
si juego á cartas descubiertas; mi intención no es intimidarte sino
convencerte. Nunca he visto que las amenazas produzcan nada bueno. Si te
gusta el servicio... bien, adelante; te afilias con nosotros y ya
está... Ahora... si no te conviene, muy dueño eres de tu voluntad y de
tu boca para darnos aquí un no redondo, y lléveme el diablo si algo más
claro que todo esto, puede salir de escotilla humana.
--¿Puedo ya contestar?, pregunté con una voz bastante trémula.
En el fondo de toda aquella charla burlona bien claro veía yo que la
amenaza de la muerte estaba en suspenso sobre mi cabeza, por lo cual mis
mejillas abrasaban y el corazón me latía dolorosamente dentro el pecho.
--Muchacho, contestó Silver, aquí nadie te está urgiendo. Forma tu
derrotero. Ninguno de nosotros tiene prisa, camarada. El tiempo corre
tan agradablemente en tu compañía que, ya lo ves, no hay para qué
precipitarse.
--Está bien, contesté yo sintiéndome con un poco más de brío y
atrevimiento. Si debo de elegir, declaro que me creo con derecho para
saber primero cómo están las cosas y por qué están Vds. aquí, y en dónde
paran mis amigos.
--¡Pues no quiere poco el niño!, dijo en tono gruñón uno de los
piratas. No sería para él poca fortuna el averiguar todo eso.
--Paréceme, amigo, dijo Silver al interruptor con un tono demasiado
agrio, que harías mejor en tapar esa escotilla y guardar tus andanadas
para cuando se te pidan y necesiten.
En seguida, volviéndose á mí, continuó con el mismo acento amable y
gracioso de antes:
--Ayer por la mañana, amigo Hawkins, á la hora de la segunda guardia,
vino por acá el Doctor Livesey trayendo en la mano una bandera de paz:
"Capitán Silver, díjome, están Vds. vendidos: ¡el buque se ha marchado!"
Aquello podía suceder muy bien; nosotros habíamos estado echando un
trago y acompañándolo de una ronda de canto para hacerlo pasar bien. No
dije que no. La verdad es que ninguno de nosotros había apuntado sus
vidrios para allá. Salimos á ver... ¡ábrase el infierno!... aquello era
verdad... ¡la goleta había desaparecido! Jamás he visto en mi vida un
puñado de hombres más dementes que estos; puedes creer que sí...
parecían frenéticos de remate. "Sea en hora buena, díjome el Doctor,
creo que es ya el caso de capitular." Y capitulamos, no hubo remedio,
capitulamos él y yo, y aquí nos tienes instalados con reducto, _cognac_,
provisiones y toda la leña que Vds. tuvieron la buena precaución de
compilar; en una palabra, el bote entero y completo desde las crucetas
hasta la sobrequilla. En cuanto á ellos, se han largado con viento
fresco, pero lléveme el diablo si sé en donde han tirado el ancla.
Diciendo esto dió una nueva fumada á su pipa con la mayor calma, hecho
lo cual prosiguió así:
--Y para que no te hagas la ilusión de que se te ha incluido en el
tratado, voy á decirte cuáles fueron las últimas palabras que hablamos.
"¿Cuántos son Vds. para salir de aquí?" le pregunté yo. "Cuatro, me
contestó, y uno de esos cuatro, herido. En cuanto á ese muchacho, yo no
sé dónde está ni me importa saberlo... el diablo cargue con él, aunque
de pronto lo sentimos mucho." Estas fueron sus palabras.
--¿Eso es ya todo?, le pregunté.
--Eso es cuanto tú tienes que oir, hijo mío, replicó Silver.
--Y ahora... ¿debo ya hacer mi elección?
--Ahora tienes que elegir; sí, mi amigo, no te quepa la menor duda.
--Está bien, continué. No soy tan gran badulaque que ignore lo que se me
espera. Pero suceda lo que suceda, y poco me importa que sea lo peor
posible. Desde que caí metido en esta aventura he visto morir á tantos
hombres, que ya la idea de la muerte no me asusta tanto. Pero hay una ó
dos cosas que quiero decir á Vds...
Mi palabra iba tomando un acento desusado de excitación. En ese tono
proseguí:
--Lo primero que quiero decir es esto: están Vds. perdidos; perdido está
el buque, perdido el tesoro, perdidos los hombres para Vds. Todo el
proyecto que ha engendrado su rebelión no es ya más que un deshecho...
¡está en pedazos! ¿Y quieren Vds. saber de quién es la obra de su
destrucción?... ¡Es mía! Yo estaba oculto en el barril de las manzanas
la noche en que vimos tierra, y desde él le oí á Vd., John, y á Vd. Dick
Johnson, y á Hands que á la hora de esta yace en el fondo del océano; y
después de oir cuanto decían lo repetí todo, palabra por palabra, antes
de que hubiera trascurrido una hora, á quienes tenían el derecho de
saberlo. Y por lo que hace á la goleta, fuí yo también el que cortó su
cable; yo quien mató á los dos hombres que tenía Vd. á bordo y yo, por
último, el que la he llevado á un punto en que ninguno de Vds. volverá á
verla jamás. Si alguien debe y puede reir en este negocio, ese soy yo...
yo, que desde un principio he tenido la ventaja sobre todos Vds., de
quienes no tengo, en este momento, más miedo del que me inspiraría una
mosca. Mátenme, si gustan, ó déjenme con vida. Pero una cosa diré
solamente para concluir, y es que, si se me deja vivir... servicio por
servicio... el día que Vds., amigos, estén en una corte del crimen,
acusados de piratería, yo salvaré de la horca, con mi testimonio, á
todos los que pueda. Vds., pues, y no yo, son los que tienen que elegir.
Maten uno más, y aumenten inútilmente, con eso, la lista de sus
crímenes; ó déjenme vivo y asegúrense, de esa manera, el testigo que
puede arrancarlos del patíbulo.
Me detuve al llegar aquí porque, lo confieso, se me había acabado el
aliento. Empero, con gran asombro mío, ninguno de aquellos hombres se
movió, sino que todos se quedaron con los ojos clavados sobre mí, como
si fuesen corderos. Aprovechándome de su silencio, y en tanto que ellos
seguían contemplándome atónitos, rompí de nuevo:
--Ahora bien, Sr. Silver, como creo que Vd. es aquí el hombre más de
confiar, quiero hacerle un solo encargo para el caso de que me acontezca
lo peor que acontecerme puede, y es que tenga la bondad de contar al
Doctor de qué manera he sufrido mi final destino.
--Lo tendré muy presente, contestó el pirata, con un acento tan extraño
que, por vida mía que me fué imposible decidir si estaba burlándose de
mí, ó si se sentía favorablemente impresionado con mi valor.
Entonces tomó la palabra aquel Morgan, cara de caoba, á quien yo ví en
la taberna de Silver, cerca de los muelles, en Brístol.
--Yo añadiré algo á todo eso, dijo, y es que ese mismo muchacho es el
que reconoció á Black Dog.
--Pues miren Vds., añadió á su vez el cocinero, yo puedo agregar aún
algo más ¡por vida del infierno! y es que el mismo muchachillo que Vds.
ven, es el que supo birlarnos la carta de Flint que guardaba Billy
Bones. Del principio al fin no hemos hecho más que estrellarnos contra
Jim Hawkins.
--¡Pues aquí las pagará todas juntas!, dijo Morgan con un horrible
juramento y avanzándose hacia mí con su gran navaja abierta.
--¡Aparta allá!, gritó Silver. ¿Quién eres aquí, tú, Tom Morgan?
Figúraseme que te has creído ser el Capitán. ¡Por Satanás mi padre y
señor, que prometo enseñarte á ser quien eres! Hazme enojar y ya verás
si no te despacho á donde muchos hombres buenos han ido á parar, por mi
mano, en estos últimos treinta años, algunos á mecerse en los peñoles,
otros al agua, atados de pies y manos, y todos ellos á engordar los
peces del océano. Acuérdate que no hay ni ha habido un hombre que se
atreva á mirarme entre ceja y ceja, que haya podido jactarse de ver un
día después de eso; Tom Morgan, ¡no eches eso en saco roto!
Morgan se detuvo, pero un murmullo ronco partió de todos los demás.
--Tom tiene razón, avanzó uno.
--Creo que he tenido, más largo tiempo del regular, á un hombre solo por
espantajo, aventuró otro. ¡Lléveme el demonio si un cojo como Vd., John
Silver, mete miedo á un hombre cabal como yo soy!
--¿Sería que alguno de Vds., caballeros, siente ganas de saber por sí
mismo quién es John Silver?...
El cocinero bramó más bien que dijo esas palabras, saltando de sobre el
barrilete de _cognac_ en que estaba sentado, avanzando bastante hacia el
grupo de los piratas y sin soltar su pipa que brillaba aún encendida en
su mano derecha. Y sin hacer pausa alguna prosiguió:
--¡Pues me parece muy bien! No más sáquese un paso al frente el que
quiera, y diga lo que se le ofrece, que me figuro que ninguno es mudo.
No tiene más que pedir; yo doy lo que se me demande. ¿Con todos los años
que tengo, había de venir ahora un botarate, hijo de algún ladrón de
agua-dulce á calarse el sombrero de través en mi presencia, como término
á mi historia? ¡Por el santísimo infierno que se equivoca! Pero que haga
la prueba el más gallito... ¡ya sabe el modo! Todos Vds. son "caballeros
de la fortuna," según Vds. mismos... ¡Pues á la obra! ¡aquí estoy listo!
Desencamise el cuchillo el que sea hombre para ello y por mi patrón
Satanás que antes de que esta pipa se acabe ya habré visto el color y el
tamaño de su asadura!...
Ninguno de aquellos hombres se movió, ninguno murmuró una palabra.
Entonces él añadió volviendo la pipa á la boca.
--¡Ah! ¡gallinas!... ¡eso es lo que son Vds.! ¡De veras que es una
gloria el ver ese montón de poltrones! Muy bravos si se trata de
batirse con una botella, pero muy sordos cuando se les llama á probar si
son lo que parecen!... Veremos si entienden Vds. el inglés de nuestro
Rey Jorge: yo soy aquí el Capitán, por elección unánime. Yo soy el
Capitán porque á legua soy mejor y valgo más que todos Vds. juntos. Así,
pues, y ya que no quiere ninguno salir conmigo á medirse como uno de los
verdaderos "caballeros de la fortuna," á obedecer todos, canallas, y sin
chistar... ¿entendidos?... Yo quiero á este muchacho; yo no he visto
jamás un chico que valga lo que vale él, y por quien soy afirmo que él
es más hombre y vale él solo mucho más que el mejor par de todas estas
ratas de navío amontonadas aquí. Ahora bien, lo que yo digo es esto y
nada más que ésto: yo lo tomo á mi lado; yo lo protejo y cubro con mi
mano. Eso es cuanto he de decir y ténganlo bien entendido!...
Después de esto vino un largo silencio. Yo permanecía aún rígido,
apoyado contra el muro, con el corazón latiéndome todavía como un
martillo de fragua, pero con un rayo de esperanza comenzando á aparecer
en el fondo de mi alma. Silver retrocedió también á su lugar primitivo,
contra la pared, y estaba allí con los brazos cruzados, con la pipa en
un ángulo de la boca, tan tranquilo y tan sereno como si hubiera estado
en una iglesia. Sin embargo, su ojo pequeño pero sagaz vagaba
furtivamente de uno á otro de sus insubordinados secuaces, á quienes
miraba incesantemente de través. Ellos, por su parte, fueron retirándose
gradualmente hacia la extremidad opuesta del recinto y allí comenzaron á
murmurar en voz baja con un rumor que me parecía el de un torrente
lejano. Uno después del otro, todos volvían la cara de vez en cuando
hacia donde estábamos Silver y yo, y al efectuar ese movimiento la luz
rojiza que caía en sus facciones les prestaba contornos y tintas
espantables. Empero sus ojeadas amenazadoras no eran ya para mí, sino
para Silver.
--Me parece que tienen Vds. pudriéndoseles de calladas una lía de cosas
que buscan aire. ¡Pues abrir las escotillas y soltarlas, sin melindres,
amigos, ó si no, apartarse!, dijo Silver escupiendo con el más altivo
desdén.
--Pues con el permiso de Vd., señor, saltó uno de los hombres. Vd. es
bastante olvidadizo tratándose de algunas de nuestras reglas. Sería, tal
vez, con el fin de vigilar por el cumplimiento de las restantes. ¡Está
bien! Pero esta tripulación que ve Vd. aquí, está descontenta; esta
tripulación está resuelta á arriesgar el todo por el todo (dispensando
la libertad) y así es que, conforme á nuestras propias reglas, según
entiendo, nos retiramos á celebrar consejo todos juntos. Vd. dispensará,
señor, reconociéndolo como lo reconocemos por nuestro Capitán á estas
horas todavía. Yo reclamo mi derecho y me salgo afuera para deliberar.
--Diciendo esto hizo un respetuoso y complicado saludo, á estilo de
marineros, y con la mayor calma y sangre fría salió afuera del reducto.
Á ese que era un sujeto alto, de aspecto enfermizo, con ojos
amarillentos y como de treinta y cinco años, siguieron otro y otros de
los de la banda, observando en todo su ejemplo. Cada uno iba haciendo su
reverencia al pasar y cada uno añadía alguna excusa por el estilo.
--¡Conforme á reglamento!, dijo uno.
--Sesión de afiliados, añadió Morgan.
Y así, ya con una expresión, ya con otra, todos salieron del reducto
dejándonos á Silver y á mí solos, iluminados por la antorcha.
El cocinero de _La Española_ se quitó, al punto, la pipa de la boca y de
una manera firme y resuelta, pero apenas perceptible, me habló así:
--Pronto, ven acá, Hawkins. Debes comprender que la cuchilla de la
muerte está colgada de un solo cabello sobre tu cabeza y, lo que es
todavía peor, acompañada de tormentos. En este instante van á deponerme
de mi cargo. Pero no importa, fíjate en ésto: yo permanezco firme de tu
lado, venga lo que viniere. No era esto lo que yo me proponía al
principio, ¡no por cierto! Pero después de que hablaste ya fué otra
cosa. Me desesperaba la idea de perder todas mis bravatas y salir
derrotado en el negocio. Pero he visto que tú eres el hombre que yo
necesito. Me dije entonces á mí mismo: "John, tú ponte del lado de
Hawkins y él estará al lado tuyo del mismo modo. Tú eres para él la
última carta del juego, y por tu patrón Satanás, John, que él puede ser
también la tuya!" Ayuda por ayuda, me dije: tú, Silver, salvas á tu
testigo y él salvará tu pescuezo, de la horca!
Aunque confusamente comencé á comprender.
--¿Quiere Vd. decir que todo está perdido?, le pregunté.
¡Ah! ¡por el infierno que sí!, me respondió. El buque ido, cuesta el
pescuezo: he allí la situación en dos palabras. Una vez que yo eché una
mirada á esa bahía, Jim Hawkins, y ví que no había ya goleta sobre qué
contar... yo soy duro y correoso, pero con todo, puedes creer que me
sentí desorientado. En cuanto á ese grupo y su concejo, te digo que no
son más que unos estúpidos y cobardes. Yo te sacaré salvo de entre sus
garras, en cuanto de mí dependa; pero lo dicho, Jim, servicio por
servicio, tú salvas á tu amigo Silver de la horca.
Me sentía anonadado y aturdido. Parecíame una cosa tan sin visos de
esperanza lo que él me pedía... él,... el viejo pirata, ¡el cabecilla de
la rebelión!
--Lo que esté en mi mano hacer, eso haré, le respondí.
--¡Pues trato hecho!, exclamó John Silver. Tú has sabido hablar con
valor y con fiereza y ¡por el infierno! yo sabré cumplirte mi palabra.
Se adelantó luego hacia la antorcha que estaba, como he dicho antes,
encajada entre la leña, y allí volvió á encender su pipa que se había
apagado.
--Entiéndeme bien, Jim, prosiguió en seguida: yo tengo una verdadera
cabeza sobre mis hombros. Lo que es ahora, nadie es más partidario del
Caballero que yo. Comprendo muy bien que tú has puesto á salvo ese buque
en alguna parte... ¿Cómo?, no lo sé; pero sí afirmo que está en seguro.
Tal vez lograste reducir y convencer á Hands y á O'Brien. Yo nunca tuve
en ellos una gran fe. Pero, fíjate en ésto: yo nada pregunto ni dejaré
que los otros pregunten. Yo sé y conozco bien cuándo un juego está de
punto, ¡sí señor! Pues te aseguro, chico, que lo que es éste, ¡ya quema!
¡Ah! tú eres un niño todavía; pero tú y yo juntos ¡cuántas y cuan buenas
cosas pudiéramos haber hecho!
Diciendo esto abrió la llave del barrilillo y dejó correr un poco de
_cognac_ en un vasito de lata.
--¿Quieres un trago, camarada?, preguntóme. Y como yo rehusase
prosiguió:
--Necesito un tónico, porque, de esta hecha, tenemos gresca dentro de
pocos momentos. Y á propósito de gresca, dime tú, ¿por qué me entregaría
el Doctor la carta de Flint?
Mi rostro expresó un asombro tan grande y tan natural, que Silver vió
luego la inutilidad de hacerme más preguntas sobre el asunto.
--¡Ah! pues sí que lo hizo, añadió. Y no me cabe duda de que debajo de
eso hay algo, no cabe duda, Jim; bueno ó malo, pero algo hay.
Dicho esto, dió un trago ó dos de _cognac_, oprimiéndose después su
grande é inteligente cabeza, con el ademán de un hombre que prevee y
teme todo lo que hay de más malo.

CAPÍTULO XXIX
OTRA VEZ EL DISCO NEGRO
La sesión de los filibusteros había durado ya por un rato bastante
considerable, cuando uno de ellos volvió á entrar al reducto y, no sin
repetir el mismo saludo ó reverencia á que antes me referí y que, á mi
entender, era más irónico que sincero, rogó á Silver que por un momento
se les prestase el hachón. John accedió desde luego y el emisario se
retiró dejándonos sumidos en la oscuridad.
--Ya comienza á soplar la brisa, Jim, dijo Silver que á la sazón había
adoptado definitivamente un tono de todo punto amistoso y familiar
conmigo.
Me aproximé entonces á la tronera que estaba más cerca de mí y eché una
ojeada hacia afuera. Los leños de la grande hoguera se habían consumido
casi por completo, brillando á esa hora tan opaca y débilmente que, con
sólo verlos, me pareció comprender la razón de que los hombres aquellos
quisieran el hachón. Como á la mitad del declive de la loma de la
estacada aparecían todos reunidos en un grupo; uno de ellos tenía la
antorcha; otro estaba medio arrodillado en medio del grupo, y pude
advertir que en su mano brillaba el acero de una navaja abierta,
produciendo cambiantes de varios colores, á la doble claridad de la
luna y de la antorcha. Los demás estaban un poco inclinados sobre el de
en medio, como si vigilasen ó atendieran con interés á lo que hacía.
Pude notar también que el mismo hombre de en medio tenía en las manos un
libro, y todavía no volvía de la extrañeza que me causaba ver en poder
de aquellos piratas una cosa tan ajena de su carácter y costumbres,
cuando el personaje arrodillado se puso de pie y todos con él comenzaron
á desfilar de nuevo hacia el reducto.
--Ya vuelven allí, dije; y al punto me apresuré á volver á colocarme en
mi posición anterior, porque me pareció indigno de mí el que me
encontrasen espiándolos.
--Déjalos que vengan, muchacho, déjalos, exclamó Silver con un gran
acento de confianza. Creo tener todavía un tiro en mi cartuchera.
La puerta dió entrada á los cinco hombres, juntos unos con otros en un
apretado grupo; pero no dieron sino un paso adentro del umbral, y
empujaron á uno de ellos, de modo que ocupase la delantera. En
cualesquiera otras circunstancias hubiera sido en extremo cómico ver
trastrabillar á aquel pobre hombre en su avance lento y vacilante y
teniendo su mano derecha empuñada delante de sí.
--Avanza, muchacho, avanza, exclamó Silver; no creas que te voy á comer.
Entrega eso, haragán; yo sé bien las reglas, puedes creerlo y no he de
meterme á maltratar á una _diputación_.
Esto dió al pirata diputado un poco más de ánimo y pudo ya adelantarse
más fácilmente. Entonces y cuando tuvo á Silver al alcance de su mano,
pasó algo á la del cocinero y en el acto retrocedió con la mayor
ligereza hasta el grupo de sus compañeros.
John Silver echó una ojeada sobre lo que se le acababa de pasar, y
murmuró:
--¡El disco negro! ¡Ya me lo esperaba! Pero ¿en dónde diablos han cogido
Vds. papel! ¡Ah! ¡Vamos! ¡ya caigo! Aquí está el secreto: pero, chicos,
esto es de mal agüero; han ido Vds. á cortar el papel de una Biblia.
¡Pues yaya que no podía darse nada de más tonto!
--¡Ah! ¿qué tal?, dijo Morgan, ¿qué tal? ¿No fué eso mismo lo que yo
dije? ¡De allí no puede salir cosa buena!
--Tanto peor para los profanadores: ¡Vds. mismos se han condenado á la
horca!, continuó Silver. Y á todo esto, ¿quién era el santurrón holgazán
que tenía una Biblia?
--Era Dick, dijo uno.
--Conque Dick, ¿eh? Pues hijo mío, ya puedes encomendarte á Dios,
replicó John. Creo que con esto ha concluído ya tu lote de buena suerte,
puedes creérmelo.
En esto el pirata flaco oji-amarillento, saltó diciendo:
--Basta ya de charla inútil, John Silver. Esta tripulación le ha pasado
á Vd. el disco negro, en sesión plena, y conforme á las reglas; Vd. no
tiene más que hacer sino voltearlo como las mismas reglas se lo mandan y
leer lo que hay escrito en él. Después podrá Vd. hablar.
¡Gracias, Jorge, un millón de gracias!, replicó el cocinero de _La
Española_. Este muchacho siempre ha sido así para todos los negocios,
vivo y enérgico. Además se sabe de memoria todas nuestras reglas, lo
cual me complace en sumo grado. Pero, en fin, veamos qué es ello, con lo
cual nada se pierde. ¡Ah! vamos: "_¡Depuesto!_" Eso es, ¿no es verdad?
¡Bonita escritura, hombre, muy bonita! Se diría que era de un maestro
de escuela! ¡Si hasta parece hecho con letras de molde! ¿Fuiste tú quien
escribió ésto, Jorge? Pues hombre, te felicito, porque, la verdad, se ve
que ya te vas haciendo un personaje notable entre estos buenos chicos.
¿Qué apostamos á que tú vas á ser mi sucesor, nombrado Capitán con todos
tus honores? Pero, entre tanto, ¿no me haces el favor de pasarme ese
hachón? Esta pipa no arde bien.
--Basta una vez más, dijo Jorge. Se acabó el tiempo en que enredaba Vd.
con su charla á esta tripulación. Vd. se tiene por muy gracioso, á lo
que entendemos; pero, por ahora, ya no es Vd. nadie, con lo cual haría
Vd. muy bien en bajarse de ese barril y ayudarnos á votar á otro jefe.
--Me pareció haberte oído decir que conocías nuestro reglamento, dijo
Silver desdeñosamente. Pero si no es así, yo sí lo conozco. Digo, en
consecuencia, que no me muevo de aquí, y añado que soy todavía el
Capitán de la banda,--fijarse bien en esto--hasta que Vds. hayan
desembuchado, una por una, todas sus quejas y yo haya contestado á
ellas. Mientras tanto, su disco negro no vale un ardite. Después de
cumplir con ese requisito, ¡ya veremos!
--¡Oh! pues en cuanto á eso no hay inconveniente en darle á Vd. gusto.
Aquí todos somos llanos y parejos y no nos mordemos la lengua. He aquí
nuestras razones: Primera: Vd. ha convertido esta expedición en un mero
jigote; supongo que no tendrá Vd. el descaro de negarlo. Segunda: Vd. ha
dejado escapar al enemigo, de esta ratonera, sin provecho alguno... ¿por
qué querían ellos salirse? yo no lo sé, pero lo que es evidente es que
salir querían. Tercera: Vd. no nos ha permitido atacarlos después de
salidos... ¡ah! no se figure que dejamos de ver claro en esto: Vd. no
juega limpio, John Silver, y eso es lo peor que puede hacer. Cuarta: ese
muchacho que se nos ha colado esta noche y á quien Vd. defiende.
--¿Eso es ya todo?, preguntó tranquilamente Silver.
--Con lo que basta y sobra, contestó Jorge. Me parece que todos
tendremos que vernos colgados y secando al sol, todo por culpa de Vd.
--Pues está bien. Voy á contestar á esos cuatro puntos, uno por uno.
¿Con que yo he hecho un jigote de esta expedición? ¡Vamos!... ¿acaso
ignoran Vds. lo que yo quería y lo que había resuelto? Vds. saben bien
que si aquello se hubiera hecho esta noche estaríamos todos á bordo de
_La Española_, como siempre, todos vivos, todos contentos, muy bien
comidos, mejor bebidos y con el tesoro almacenado en la cala, ¡con mil
demonios! Y bien, ¿quién se me interpuso? ¿quién forzó mi mano que era
la del legítimo capitán? ¿quién me hizo pasar el disco negro el mismo
día que desembarcamos y comenzó esta danza?... ¡Ah! ¡bonita danza por
cierto! Ya me veo en ella con Vds. hasta el verdadero fin. Esto me
parece tan gracioso y divertido como si viera una gaita colgando en la
punta de la horca en la Playa de los Ajusticiados. Pero ¿de quién es la
culpa? Pues bien, fueron Anderson, y Hands, y tú, Jorge Merry, los que
determinaron aquello. Tú eres el único que queda vivo de esos oficiosos
impertinentes, y ahora te me vienes con la insolencia estúpida y
endemoniada de ponérteme enfrente para tomar mi puesto de capitán... tú
que has hundido á la mayoría de nuestra tripulación! ¡Por mi patrón
Satanás, esto sí que es el más alto colmo de la desvergüenza y del
cinismo!
Silver hizo una pausa durante la cual pude observar en los semblantes de
Jorge y sus camaradas, que aquella filípica tremenda no había sido
pronunciada en vano.
--Eso es por lo que hace al cargo número uno, dijo el acusado endulzando
un poco el ceño terriblemente adusto con que hasta allí había hablado, y
bajando el diapasón de aquella voz con que acababa hacer retemblar la
casa.
--Es cosa que pone á uno enfermo, prosiguió, el disgusto de tener que
entenderse con Vds. De todos no hay uno que tenga ni entendimiento, ni
memoria; y hasta me admiro de pensar cómo se les iría el santo al cielo
á sus mamás que los dejaron meterse á la mar. ¡Á la mar!... ¡Marinos
Vds.! "¡caballeros de la fortuna!"... Sastres; ése debe ser su oficio.
--Siga Vd., John, dijo Morgan. Pero háblele á los demás también; no, no
más á mí.
--¡Ah! ¡sí! ¡los otros! ¡precioso hato de hombres! ¿no es verdad? Dicen
Vds. que esta expedición está desconcertada y descuadernada. ¡Oh! ¡si
pudieran Vds. comprender hasta qué punto está descuadernada! ¡ya verían
Vds. entonces! Básteme decirles que tenemos todos la horca tan cerca que
casi huelo el cáñamo y siento el pescuezo oprimido, de sólo pensar en
ello. Ya Vds. habían visto ese espectáculo... ¡qué hermoso! ¿no es
verdad? Un hombre cargado de cadenas, suspenso de una cuerda, rodeado de
buitres que revolotean sobre su cadáver ó almuerzan tranquilamente con
sus entrañas. Y los marineros horrorizados señalándoselo con el dedo,
unos á otros, cuando á la hora de la bajamar cruzan en sus barquillas
junto al patíbulo. "¿Quién es ese?" dice uno--"¿Ese? ¿y lo preguntas?
Pues es John Silver; yo lo conocí muy bien," le contesta otro. Y entre
tanto, puede llegar hasta los oídos del trabajador marino que cruza
hacia la boya cercana, el ruido siniestro con que golpean unas con otras
las cadenas de aquel ajusticiado... Pues hay que convencerse de que éso
es lo que nos aguarda, á cada hijo de su madre, en esta compañía,
gracias á Jorge, y á Hands y Anderson y á todos los torpes que han
arruinado este negocio. Ahora, si quieren Vds. que conteste á su cuarto
punto, es decir, á ese muchacho Hawkins ¡por el diablo en persona! ¿se
figuran Vds. que vamos á asesinar á un huésped? ¡No nosotros, por vida
mía! Es muy posible que él sea nuestra última tabla en el naufragio y no
me sorprenderé que así sea. ¿Matar á este chico? ¡Repito que no,
camaradas! ¿Y sobre el punto tercero? ¡Ah! mucho hay que decir sobre el
tercer punto. Podrá suceder que para Vds. nada significa tener un Doctor
entero y verdadero que viene á visitarlos diariamente, á tí John con tu
cabeza rota, ó á tí Jorge Merry á quien la malaria ha puesto allí con
unos ojos amarillos como limón maduro y que todavía no hace seis horas
estabas tiritando con el calofrío y delirando con la fiebre. Podrá
suceder también que ignoren Vds. que hay un segundo buque que debe venir
á buscar á la tripulación de _La Española_, si se dilata por cierto
tiempo. Pues sí, señores, viene, y para entonces ya veremos quien se
alegra ó quien siente recibir una visita. Y por lo que hace al número
dos, esto es, cuál es la razón que tuve para hacer un trato, no tienen
Vds. más que ponerse todos aquí de rodillas, de rodillas como vinieron
un día á pedírmelo, arrastrándose, para que lo hiciera yo. Pues allí es
nada, vean Vds. la causa... ¡ésa es!
Y diciendo esto, arrojó en medio del grupo, sobre el piso, un papel que
yo reconocí en el instante y que no era otra cosa que el mapa en
pergamino, con las tres cruces rojas, que yo encontré en la tela
impermeable guardada en el fondo del cofre del Capitán. Por qué razón el
Doctor había pasado aquello á Silver, era problema que yo no acertaba á
resolver.
Pero si bien, para mí, aquello no tenía explicación plausible, la carta
fué en sí de un efecto increíble y mágico para los revoltosos. Todos á
una saltaron sobre ella como gatos sobre un ratón. Pasáronsela de mano
en mano, pero casi arañándose unos á otros para arrebatársela. Al oir
los gritos, los juramentos, las carcajadas infantiles con que
acompañaban su examen, se habría creído, no sólo que ya tenían entre las
manos el oro codiciado, sino que ya se veían en alta mar, en posesión de
él, y en completamente en salvo.
--Por supuesto, dijo uno; esto es de Flint, luego se ve. Aquí están sus
iniciales J. F. y debajo una raya con un clavo atravesado encima, que
era lo que él siempre ponía en su nombre.
--Todo esto está muy bueno, dijo Jorge, pero la cosa es que ¿cómo nos
vamos á llevar la hucha si ya no hay buque?
--¡Jorge Merry!, gritó Silver poniéndose violentamente de pie y
apoyándose con una mano contra la pared. Voy á hacerte una prevención á
tiempo. Si sueltas una palabra más, tienes que salirte de aquí allá
abajo y verte la cara conmigo, que tengo la certeza de aplastarte.
¿Cómo?... ¡Qué sé yo! ¿Tienes la insolencia de proferir lo que has
dicho, tú, que con tus compinches has causado la pérdida de mi goleta,
á causa de tu intervención? ¡tráguete el infierno! ¡No! no serás tú el
que nos saque del atolladero, porque tú no puedes alcanzar ni á la pobre
inventiva de una cucaracha. En nada de este asunto puedes tú tomar la
palabra, Jorge Merry; y cuenta con desobedecerme.
--Eso es muy claro, dijo el viejo Morgan.
--¡Claro! ¡pues ya lo creo!, replicó el cocinero. Tú perdiste el buque y
yo encontré el tesoro ¿quién vale de nosotros dos, Jorge Merry? Y
ahora... presento mi renuncia. Pueden Vds. elegir Capitán á quien les dé
la gana. Yo tengo ya bastante del cargo éste.
--¡Silver!, gritaron todos en coro. ¡Barbacoa ahora y siempre! ¡Barbacoa
es nuestro Capitán! ¡Viva Barbacoa!
--¡En hora buena! esas tenemos ¿no es verdad?, exclamó el cocinero. Pues
ya lo ves, Jorge, por hoy me parece que tendrás que aguardar otro turno
para tener tu capitanía. Y da gracias al demonio de que yo no sea un
hombre vengativo. Pero es la verdad, no es ese mi modo. Y ahora bien,
camaradas... ¿este disco negro?... Me parece que por hoy no vale ya gran
cosa, ¿no es verdad? Todo se reducirá á que Dick haya oscurecido su
buena estrella y maltratado su Biblia... ¡nada más!
--¿No cree Vd. que la cosa se compondrá besando severamente el libro?,
exclamó Dick que positivamente se sentía desazonado al pensar en la
maldición celeste que creía haber hecho caer sobre su cabeza.
--¡Una Biblia con un pedazo recortado!, dijo Silver sarcásticamente.
¡Imposible! Entre ella y una simple colección de canciones no hay ya
diferencia alguna.
--¿Cree Vd. que no?, replicó Dick con cierta especie de alegría. ¡Bueno!
pues sin embargo, creo que todavía vale la pena de guardarla.
--Y ahora, Jim, dijo Silver, aquí hay una curiosidad para tu colección
de ellas.
Diciendo esto me pasó el pedacillo de papel: era éste como del tamaño de
una moneda "corona." De un lado nada tenía impreso, porque era la última
hoja del libro: del otro lado contenía un versículo de la Revelación, y
en él me llamaron la atención estas palabras de una manera particular:
"Afuera están los perros y los asesinos." El lado impreso había sido
ennegrecido con carbón de la hoguera, que á la sazón comenzaba ya á
desprenderse y á manchar mis dedos; en el lado blanco habíase escrito
con el mismo material la palabra "Depuesto." Todavía al escribir este
relato conservo en mi poder aquella curiosidad, y la tengo aquí, sobre
mi mesa; pero no podría ya verse en ella la menor huella de escritura,
si no es una especie de araño como el que alguien podría hacer con la
uña de su dedo pulgar.
Con aquello terminaron los sucesos de esa noche. Á pocos momentos se
sirvió á todos un vaso de _cognac_ y nos tendimos todos á dormir. La
señal de venganza que dió Silver fué nombrar á Jorge para hacer cuarto
de centinela, amenazándole con la muerte si no obraba con toda lealtad.
Mucho rato se pasó para que yo pudiera cerrar los ojos, y bien saben los
cielos que razón me sobraba al solo recuerdo de aquel hombre á quien por
la tarde había yo quitado involuntariamente la vida, en el instante de
mayor peligro para la mía. Pero lo que más contribuía á desvelarme era
aquella partida terrible y sagaz que acababa de ver jugar á Silver,
cuyos maravillosos esfuerzos tendían, por un lado, á mantener unidos y á
raya á los sublevados, y por el otro á intentar todos los medios
humanos, posibles é imposibles, para obtener una reconciliación y salvar
su miserable existencia. Pero él, por su parte, se durmió al momento de
la manera más apacible y muy pronto comencé á oir el estrépito de sus
ronquidos. Entre tanto mi corazón se oprimía penosamente al pensar en
los riesgos inminentes que rodeaban á aquel hombre, por más malvado que
fuera; y en la horca infamante que tenía como última perspectiva de su
triste carrera.

CAPÍTULO XXX
BAJO PALABRA
Una voz clara y alegre que sonaba á la orilla del bosque llamando á los
del reducto me despertó, y despertó igualmente á todos los demás; y el
centinela mismo que se había buenamente recargado contra la puerta se
estremeció enderezándose en su puesto.
--¡Ha del reducto!, gritaba la voz. Aquí viene el Doctor.
Y el Doctor era, no cabía dada. Yo sentía gusto, ciertamente en escuchar
aquel acento amigo, pero mi alegría no era muy pura que digamos.
Recordé, al punto, con gran bochorno, mi insubordinación y conducta
furtiva, y al ver á qué extremo me había ella conducido, en qué compañía
y de qué peligros me rodeaba, sentí vergüenza de ver al Doctor á la
cara.
Él debió haberse levantado muy de madrugada, por que la luz no llegaba
aún decididamente, y cuando yo hube corrido á una de las troneras para
verle, le divisé allá abajo, de pie, y como á Silver el día de su
misión, hundido hasta las rodillas en una niebla rastrera.
--¡Es Vd. Doctor! ¡Santos y buenos días tenga vuesa merced!, dijo Silver
perfectamente despierto y armado de excelente humor en un momento. Vivo
y madrugador, no cabe duda, pero ya sabemos aquí que, como lo dice el
dicho "el pájaro madrugador es el que coge las raciones." Jorge,
muévete, muchacho, y ayuda al Doctor Livesey á saltar á bordo de este
navío. Por aquí todo va bien, Doctor; todos sus enfermos van mejorando
mucho y todos están contentos.
Hablando de esta suerte estaba allí, de pie en la cima de la loma, con
su muleta bajo el brazo y con la otra mano apoyándose en una de las
paredes de la casa. Su actitud, su acento, sus palabras, sus modales, ya
eran, de nuevo, los del mismo John Silver que yo conociera en Brístol.
--Le tenemos preparada á Vd., por hoy, una pequeña sorpresa Señor
Doctor, continuó. Tenemos aquí un extrañito. Un nuevo comensal y
huésped, sí señor, tan listo y templado como un violín. Aquí ha dormido
toda la noche, como un sobrecargo, al lado mismo del viejo John.
Á este tiempo, el Doctor Livesey había ya saltado la estacada y estaba
muy cerca del cocinero, por lo cual pude observar muy bien la alteración
de la voz en que preguntaba:
--¿Supongo que no será Jim?
--El mismo Jim en cuerpo y alma, sí señor, contestó Silver.
El Doctor se detuvo afuera, y aunque no respondió ya palabra alguna,
pasaron algunos segundos antes de que pareciera poder moverse.
--¡Bien, bien!, dijo por último. Primero la obligación y luego el
placer, como se diría Vd. á sí mismo. Vamos á ver y á examinar á esos
enfermos.
Un momento después ya estaba adentro de la cabaña y sin tener para mí
más que una torva inclinación de cabeza, se puso en el acto á la obra
con sus enfermos. No parecía tener el más pequeño recelo, á pesar de que
debe haber comprendido muy bien que su vida en manos de aquellos
traidores y endemoniados piratas estaba pendiente de un cabello. Con la
misma naturalidad que si estuviera haciendo una ordinaria visita
profesional á una tranquila familia en Inglaterra, iba de paciente en
paciente, sonando, componiendo y arreglándolo todo. Sus maneras, á lo
que creo, habían ejercido una reacción saludable sobre aquellos hombres,
porque el caso es que se comportaban con él como si nada hubiera
sucedido, como si todavía fuese el mismo médico de á bordo y ellos
marinos leales en sus puestos respectivos.
--Lo que es tú vas muy bien, dijo al individuo de la cabeza entrapajada.
Y si hombre alguno en el mundo recibió un porrazo peligroso, ése has
sido tú: tu cabeza debe ser dura como de acero. Vamos á ver tú, Jorge,
¿cómo estás hoy? Bonito color de limón estás echando allí, no te quepa
duda: es que el hígado se te ha vuelto hacia abajo. ¿Tomaste esa
medicina? Á ver, muchachos, digan la verdad ¿tomó Jorge su medicina?
--¡Oh! en cuanto á eso, sí señor, de veras que sí, respondió Morgan.
--La cosa es que, desde que me he convertido en médico de rebeldes, ó
diré mejor, en médico de cárcel, continuó el Doctor en el tono más
afable, vengo considerando como un puesto de honor para mí el no perder
ni un solo hombre para nuestro Rey Jorge (Q. D. G.) y para la horca.
Los malvados aquellos se miraron unos á otros, pero no hicieron más que
tragar la píldora en silencio.
--Dick no está hoy muy bien, señor, dijo uno.
--¿Esas tenemos? Á ver, ven acá, Dick, llamó el Doctor. Enséñame esa
lengua. No, no me sorprende que se sienta mal: esta lengua de por sí
bastaría para espantar á una armada francesa. ¡Otra malaria tenemos!
--¡Ah! dijo Morgan, eso resulta de andar profanando Biblias.
--Eso resulta de ser, como tú dices, unos asnos monteses, replicó el
Doctor; ó para hablarte más claro, de no saber distinguir un aire
viciado y ponzoñoso, de un aire sano y vivificador, ni un pantano
inmundo y envenenado de una tierra alta y seca. Me parece lo más
probable (sin que pase esto de una opinión, por supuesto) que todos Vds.
sin excepción van á tener que pagar el duro tributo de la fiebre antes
de que logremos arrojar de sus cuerpos los gérmenes de la malaria que
absorbieron por todos los poros. ¡Acampar en un marjal!... Silver, me
sorprende verle á Vd. autorizar tal disparate. Vd. es mucho menos tonto
que todos estos juntos, pero no se me figura que tenga Vd. ni los más
pequeños rudimentos de higiene.
--Está bien, añadió después que ya hubo medicinado á todos, y cuando ya
cada uno había tomado su droga respectiva con una humildad infantil que
distaba mucho de denunciar á aquellos hombres como sanguinarios
rebeldes, y piratas. Está bien; por hoy ya no hay más que hacer. Y
ahora, desearía tener un rato de conversación con ese muchacho.
Y diciendo esto me señaló con un desdeñoso movimiento de cabeza.
Jorge Merry estaba en la puerta escupiendo alguna medicina poco
agradable, pero apenas el Doctor dijo sus últimas palabras, se volvió
con un movimiento brusco y casi bramó así:
¡No! ¡por cien mil diablos!
Silver golpeó sobre la barrica con su mano abierta y rugió estas dos
palabras, tomando el aspecto de un verdadero león.
--¡Silencio tú!
Y luego en su melifluo tono habitual prosiguió:
--Doctor, ya estaba yo pensando en ello, sabiendo lo mucho que siempre
ha querido Vd. á este chiquillo. Todos nosotros le estamos á Vd.
inmensamente agradecidos por su amabilidad y, como Vd. lo ve, ponemos la
más gran fe en Vd. y tomamos sus drogas como empinaríamos un jarro de
_grog_. Creo pues, que he encontrado un medio que lo concilia todo.
Hawkins, ¿quieres darme tu palabra de honor, como caballero, puesto que
lo eres, aunque jovencito y pobre de nacimiento, de que no nos jugarás
una mala pasada?
--Cuente Vd. con mi palabra, le contesté sin vacilar.
--Pues entonces, Doctor, añadió Silver, no tiene Vd. que hacer más sino
salir afuera del recinto de la estacada, y una vez allí, yo
personalmente llevaré abajo á Jim para que, él de este lado y Vd. del
otro, puedan conversar á través de los grandes claros de los postes. Que
Vd. lo pase muy bien, Doctor, y presente mis más humildes respetos al
Caballero y al Capitán Smollet.
La explosión de descontento, mal reprimida por las miradas terribles de
Silver, se produjo no bien el Doctor salió del reducto. Silver fué
rotundamente acusado de jugar doble; de intentar una reconciliación
especial para sí; de sacrificar los intereses de sus cómplices y
víctimas y, en una palabra, de hacer precisamente lo mismo que en
realidad estaba haciendo. Me parecía aquello, á la verdad, tan claro,
que no me era posible imaginar como podría él desarmar su furia. Pero lo
cierto es que él solo valía doble, como hombre, que todos aquellos
juntos, y que su triunfo de la víspera le había asegurado una sólida
preponderancia sobre el ánimo de cada cual. Díjoles muy formalmente la
mayor sarta imaginable de sandeces y tonterías, para convencerlos;
añadió que era preciso de todo punto que hablase yo con el Doctor; les
paseó una vez más la carta por delante de los ojos y concluyó por
preguntarles si alguno se atrevía decididamente á romper los tratados el
día mismo en que se les permitía ponerse ya en busca del tesoro.
--¡No! ¡por el infierno!, exclamó. Nosotros somos los que debemos romper
el tratado, pero hasta su debido tiempo. Entre tanto yo he de mimar y
embaucar á ese Doctor, aun cuando me viera obligado á limpiarle sus
botas personalmente.
Dicho esto les ordenó que arreglasen el fuego y se lanzó afuera, sobre
su muleta y apoyando una de sus manos sobre mi hombro, dejándolos
desconcertados y silenciosos; pero más embotados por su palabrería que
convencidos con sus razones.
--¡Despacio!, chico, ¡despacio!, díjome moderando la rapidez de mi
marcha. Podríamos hacerlos caer sobre nosotros en un abrir y cerrar de
ojos, si viesen que nos apresurábamos demasiado.
Ya entonces deteniéndonos con toda deliberación nos adelantamos á
través de la arena basta el punto en que, habiendo ya cumplido la
condición, el Doctor esperaba al otro lado de la empalizada.
--Vd. tomará nota de lo que hago en este momento, Doctor, dijo Silver en
cuanto que llegamos á distancia de poder hablar. Además Jim le contará á
Vd. cómo he salvado anoche su vida, y cómo fuí depuesto por sola esa
razón, no lo olvide Vd. Doctor, cuando un hombre hace cuanto está en su
poder por dar á su embarcación el rumbo cierto, como yo lo hago; cuando
con sus postreros esfuerzos trata aún de jugar al hoyuelo, ¿cree Vd. que
será mucho conceder á semejante hombre el decirle una palabra de
esperanza? Vd. no debe perder de vista que ahora no se trata ya
simplemente de mi vida, sino de la de este muchacho, que está
comprometida en nuestro trato; así, pues, hábleme Vd. claro, Doctor y
déme siquiera un rayo de esa esperanza que solicito, para seguir en mi
obra; hágalo Vd. por favor.
Silver era, en aquel momento, un hombre totalmente diverso del que
parecía antes de volver la espalda á sus amigos. Allí estaba ahora, con
la voz trémula, con las mejillas caídas, y con toda la apariencia de una
persona muerta positivamente.
--¿Qué es eso, John?, díjole el Doctor. ¡Me figuro que no tiene Vd.
miedo!
--Doctor, replicó él. Yo no tengo de cobarde ni tanto así. Si lo fuera
no lo confesaría. Pero es el caso que creo ya sentir los horrendos
estremecimientos del patíbulo. Vd. es un hombre bueno y leal; yo nunca
ví sujeto mejor que Vd. Así, pues, lo que deseo es que Vd. no se olvide
de lo bueno que yo haya hecho y procure olvidar lo malo. Con esto, me
hago ya á un lado, vea Vd., aquí, para dejarlos á Vds. hablar á solas. Y
quiero que añada Vd. esto más á mi favor también, pues estamos pasando
por una situación más que espinosa.
Diciendo esto se retiró un poco hacia atrás hasta colocarse donde no
pudiera oirnos, y allí tomó asiento en el tronco de uno de los abetos
cortados y comenzó á silbar, girando en torno de su asiento una y otra
con el objeto de vigilar tanto á mí y al Doctor, como á sus
insubordinados secuaces de allá arriba que se ocupaban en ir de aquí
para allá en la arena arreglando el fuego y yendo y viniendo á la cabaña
de la cual sacaban tocino y pan para confeccionar su almuerzo.
--Conque sí, amiguito, díjome el Doctor en un tono triste, por fin ya
estás aquí, ¿eh? Lo que has sembrado eso es lo que cosechas, muchacho.
Bien sabe Dios que no me siento con la energía necesaria para reñirte en
regla, pero no omitiré decirte esto, ya sea que te parezca suave ó duro:
cuando el Capitán Smollet estaba bueno y sano jamás te atreviste á
salirte, pero en cuanto que lo viste herido y que nada podía impedírtelo
¡por San Jorge! entonces te aprovechaste al punto. ¡Mira tú si conducta
semejante no era ruin y cobarde!
Debo confesar que al oir esto me eché á llorar sin poderme contener. En
cuanto pude hablar, dije:
--Doctor, Vd. puede disculparme; demasiados reproches me he hecho yo
mismo; pero, como quiera que sea, mi vida está perdida, y ya hubiera yo
muerto á la hora de esta á no ser porque Silver ha estado de mi parte,
y--créame Vd. Doctor--yo puedo muy bien morir y aun me atrevo á decir
que lo merezco, pero, francamente, la idea de ser torturado me
aterroriza. Si, pues, llega el caso de que me den tormento...
--Jim, me interrumpió el Doctor, en una voz bastante cambiada ya; Jim,
no puedo consentir en semejante idea. ¡Salta al punto este cercado y
correremos hasta ponernos en salvo!
--Doctor, le dije, tengo empeñada mi palabra.
--Ya lo sé, ya lo sé, me replicó. No podemos evitar el faltar á ella,
Jim. Yo asumo la responsabilidad del acto; toda sobre mí, hijo mío.
Vergüenza ó castigo, yo me comprometo á sufrir lo que venga. Pero es
imposible dejarte aquí. ¡Vamos! date prisa... ¡brinca! de un solo salto
ya estarás al otro lado y te aseguro que correremos como antílopes.
--¡No!, le contesté. Vd. comprende bien que Vd. mismo sería incapaz de
hacer lo que me aconseja; y como Vd., no lo harían ni el Caballero, ni
el Capitán... Pues ni yo tampoco. Silver ha confiado en mí. Me ha dejado
sin más lazo que la garantía de mi palabra... tengo, pues, que volver y
volveré. Pero Vd. no me ha dejado terminar: si se llega el caso de que
me den tormento, decía yo, podría suceder que se me escapara alguna
confesión acerca del punto donde la goleta está ahora, puesto que yo he
logrado capturarla, en parte por mi buena suerte y en parte
arriesgándome un poco. _La Española_, Doctor, está en estos momentos en
la Bahía Norte, hacia su playa meridional, precisamente abajo de la
marca de la pleamar. Á media marea debe encontrársela alta y en seco.
--¡La goleta!, exclamó asombrado el Doctor.
Brevemente le referí mis aventuras de mar que él escuchó en silencio.
--Hay en esto una especie de hado misterioso, díjome cuando hube
concluido. Á cada paso eres tú el destinado á salvar nuestras vidas. ¿Y
puedes suponer, por tanto, que vamos á dejarte aquí á una perdición
segura? Sería eso una gratitud de muy mala calidad, amigo Jim. Tú
descubriste la conspiración; tú encontraste á Ben Gunn, hazaña la más
notable que en tu vida has hecho y que harás aun cuando vivas más que
Matusalém. ¡Oh! ¡por el cielo! y hablando de Ben Gunn, este es el daño
personificado. ¡Silver!, gritó; ¡Silver!...
Y cuando el cocinero estuvo bastante cerca para poder oirlo, prosiguió.
--No tengan Vds. ninguna prisa respecto de este tesoro: es consejo que
me permito dar á Vd.
--Puede Vd. creer, señor, contestó John, que hago todo cuanto está en mi
mano para hacer tiempo. Pero tenga Vd. entendido que de emprender la
descubierta del tal tesoro dependen mi vida y la de este muchacho; no
hay que olvidarlo.
--En hora buena, Silver, replicó el Doctor. Si ello es así, daré todavía
un paso más en mis advertencias: cuidado con un chubasco posible, cuando
se encuentre.
--Doctor, dijo Silver, como de hombre á hombre debo decir á Vd. que sus
palabras ó me dicen demasiado, ó bien poco. ¿Qué es lo que Vds.
persiguen; por qué dejaron este reducto; por qué me dieron la carta;
todo eso lo ignoro, ¿no es verdad? Y sin embargo, ya ve Vd. que sigo sus
instrucciones á ojos cerrados sin haber recibido ni una sola palabra de
esperanza. Pues bien, esto último es ya demasiado. Si no quiere Vd.
decirme claramente qué es lo que Vd. quiere darme á entender,
decláremelo así sin rodeos y le ofrezco á Vd. que al punto suelto el
timón.
--No, contestó el Doctor. No tengo derecho de decir nada más: no es un
secreto mío, Silver; que si lo fuera, le empeño á Vd. mi palabra de que
lo diría. Sin embargo, me avanzo, en bien suyo, hasta donde creo que
puedo atreverme, y un paso más todavía; porque me parece que el Capitán
va á ajustarme la peluca si no me equivoco. Pero no importa: por primera
vez, Silver, le doy á Vd. alguna esperanza; si ambos salimos vivos de
esta lobera, le ofrezco á Vd. que, menos perjurar, haré cuanto esté en
mi mano por salvarle.
La fisonomía de Silver radió con una expresión brillante.
--Si fuera Vd. mi madre, exclamó aquel hombre, no podría Vd. decir nada
que me consolara más; estoy seguro.
--¡Bien!, esa es mi primera concesión, añadió el Doctor. La segunda es
algo como un nuevo consejo: guarde Vd. á este muchacho muy cerca de sí,
y si necesitare Vd. ayuda, no haga más que gritar. Yo voy á asegurársela
á Vd., y eso mismo le probará que yo no hablo á la ventura. Adiós, Jim.
Diciendo esto, el Doctor Livesey me apretó la mano, al través de los mal
unidos postes, hizo una inclinación á Silver y se alejó á paso vigoroso
perdiéndose luego entre la arboleda.

CAPÍTULO XXXI
EN BUSCA DEL TESORO--EL DIRECTORIO DE FLINT
--Jim, díjome Silver en cuanto que estuvimos solos: si yo salvé tu vida,
tú has salvado también la mía y te ofrezco no olvidarlo. Ya noté al
Doctor urgiéndote para que te fugases; lo he visto de reojo, sí señor, y
he visto que tú no has querido; lo he visto tan claro como si lo hubiera
oído. Jim, esto debo abonártelo en cuenta. Desde que el primer ataque
falló, este es el primer rayo de esperanza que me llega, y ese lo debo á
tí. Ahora, bien, es ya tiempo de que nos pongamos en marcha en busca de
ese tesoro, llevando pliegos cerrados, como quien dice; lo cual no es de
mi gusto; pero sea como fuere, tú y yo debemos mantenernos siempre
juntos, casi espalda con espalda, y yo te aseguro que salvaremos
nuestros pescuezos, á despecho del hado y de la fortuna.
En aquel mismo instante un hombre nos dió voces desde arriba gritando
que el almuerzo estaba listo; por lo cual, sin más deliberaciones,
llegamos cerca de la hoguera y nos sentamos todos aquí y allá, sobre la
arena, haciendo los honores al bizcocho y al tocino frito.
Habían encendido los piratas una hoguera capaz de asar un buey entero y
verdadero; y esa hoguera se había puesto tan ardiente que no era
posible acercársele, sino por el lado que soplaba el viento, y eso con
bastantes precauciones. Con el mismo espíritu de desperdicio, á lo que
supongo, habían cocinado una cantidad de carne, por lo menos, tres veces
mayor de la que necesitábamos y podíamos comer, por lo cual uno de
ellos, con una estúpida risotada arrojó á la hoguera todo cuanto quedó
sobrante, atizándose en gran manera el fuego con este nuevo pábulo.
Nunca en mi vida he visto hombres más descuidados del mañana; "mano á la
boca" es lo único que puede describir su manera de ser y obrar. Con
desperdicio de víveres y centinelas que se dormían, podían aquellos
hombres estar buenos, quizás, para una escaramuza de momento y salir con
bien en ella, pero era evidente que no servían en manera alguna para
algo que se pareciese á una campaña prolongada.
El mismo Silver corriendo con su _Capitán Flint_ posado en su hombro, no
tenía una sola palabra de reproche para su falta de previsión y de
cuidado. Y esto me sorprendió tanto más cuanto que me parecía que aquel
hombre jamás se había mostrado tan astuto y marrullero como aquel día.
--¡Ah!, camarada, dijo: deben Vds. tenerse por muy felices con tener por
Capitán á este Barbacoa para que piense en vez de Vds. con esta cabeza
que Dios le ha dado. Ya he dado con lo que quería, prosiguió. Esas
gentes tienen el buque ¿en dónde? aún no lo descubro; pero una vez que
demos con la hucha, ya sabremos descubrirlo. Además, muchachos, nosotros
tenemos los botes, es decir, les llevamos la ventaja.
Sobre este tema continuó disertando, sin esperar á que su boca
estuviese libre de los tremendos bocados de tocino que se llevaba á
ella. Esto sirvió para restablecer la esperanza y la fe de los piratas;
pero yo en cambio tornándome desconfiado, sentí rebajarse mucho las que
había cobrado, poco rato hacía.
--En cuanto á nuestro huésped, continuó, me parece que no volverá á
tener otra conversación con aquellos á quienes tanto quiere. Ya he
recibido mis pocas de noticias y gracias le sean dadas por ello; pero
eso ya está hecho y pasado. Por ahora me lo llevo entre filas mientras
dura nuestra busca del tesoro, pues creo que el guardarlo con nosotros
es tanto como guardar oro molido, por "lo que pudiera suceder" ¿no es
verdad? Pero una vez que tengamos el dinero y el navío--las dos cosas--y
nos demos á la mar como buenos camaradas, entonces ¡qué! nos
despediremos del Sr. Hawkins, sí señor, y le daremos su parte, sin que
quepa la menor duda, agradeciéndole todos sus servicios y amabilidades
para con sus amigos.
No era de sorprender que aquellos hombres estuvieran de buen humor; mas
por lo que hace á mí me sentía terriblemente descorazonado. Me parecía
que en el caso de que el proyecto que acababa de bosquejar pareciese
factible; Silver, doblemente traidor, no vacilaría ciertamente en
adoptarlo. En aquellos momentos tenía todavía un pie en cada campamento,
pero no era de dudarse que preferiría la riqueza y la libertad, con los
piratas, á la débil probabilidad de escapar al verdugo, lo cual era lo
más que le esperaba de nuestro lado.
Pero aun suponiendo que los sucesos se presentaran de tal manera que
aquel hombre se viese constreñido á guardar la fe del pacto con el
Doctor Livesey; aun suponiendo esto, ¡qué peligro tan terrible no
teníamos en frente! ¡qué momento tan crítico aquel en que las sospechas
de sus secuaces y cómplices se trocaran en perfecta realidad! ¡qué lucha
tan á muerte y tan desigual, la de cinco marineros vigorosos, ágiles y
decididos, contra un viejo inválido y un débil niño!
Añádase á esta doble preocupación el misterio que aun envolvería, á mis
ojos, la conducta de mis compañeros; su inexplicable abandono de la
estacada; su no menos extraña cesión del mapa de Flint, ó, lo que
todavía era para mí más incomprensible, aquella última prevención del
Doctor á Silver: "Cuidado con un chubasco posible cuando se encuentre."
Añádase todo esto y se comprenderá sin dificultad qué poco sabor pude
tomar á mi almuerzo y con qué poca tranquilidad me puse en marcha detrás
de mis capturadores, en busca del dichoso tesoro.
Nuestro aspecto era bien curioso y hubiera divertido á cualquiera que
hubiese podido vernos: todos con trajes de marino perfectamente sucios,
y todos, excepto yo, armados hasta los dientes. Silver llevaba dos
fusiles colgados, uno sobre el pecho y el otro á la espalda, ambos en
bandolera; al cinto llevaba ceñida su gran cuchilla y en cada bolsa de
su saco una pistola. Para completar esta extraña figura _Capitán Flint_
iba posado sobre su hombro chapurreando toda clase de tonteras y frases
incoherentes de charlas marinas. Yo marchaba atado á la cintura por una
cuerda cuyo extremo llevaba el cocinero á ratos con su mano desocupada,
á ratos sujeta con su poderosa dentadura; no me quedaba más recurso que
seguirle humildemente, pero lo cierto es que parecía yo un oso de
feria.
[Illustration: EN BUSCA DEL TESORO.
"... todos, excepto yo, armados hasta los dientes."]
Los restantes iban diversamente cargados: unos, con picos, palas y
azadones, que habían cuidado de sacar de _La Española_ desde el primer
momento; y otros con víveres para la comida de medio día. Todas las
provisiones eran las mismas nuestras; lo que probó que Silver había
dicho la verdad la noche anterior. Si el Doctor y él no hubiesen
concluído un verdadero convenio, tanto él como sus secuaces se verían
precisados á subsistir con agua clara y con el producto de sus cacerías.
El agua habría sido bien poca cosa para su paladar y, por lo que hace á
la caza, un marinero no es precisamente lo que se llama un buen tirador;
á lo cual hay que añadir que es muy probable que si andaban escasos de
provisiones no debían estar más bien provistos de pólvora y municiones.
Ahora bien; así dispuestos y equipados nos pusimos en camino, sin
exceptuar ni el sujeto de la cabeza rota, el cual, por lo visto, debería
haber quedádose á la sombra. Uno tras de otro fuimos hasta la playa en
que los botes estaban amarrados. En ellos notábanse también las huellas
de las brutales borracheras de los piratas; uno tenía un travesaño roto
y ambos estaban positivamente asquerosos con lodo y toda clase de
inmundicias. Por vía de precaución se tomaron ambos esquifes,
dividiéndose la banda en ellos, y ya embarcados en esa disposición nos
pusimos en movimiento hacia el centro del ancladero.
Al ponernos en movimiento no dejó de suscitarse alguna discusión acerca
del mapa. Por de contado la cruz roja era demasiado grande para que por
sí sola pudiera servirnos de guía, y los términos en que estaba
concebida la nota á espaldas del pergamino no dejaban de contener alguna
ambigüedad. Como se recordará, decían así:
     "Árbol elevado en el declive del 'Vigía' en dirección de Norte á
     Nor-Nordeste.
     "Islote del Esqueleto, Este Sudeste, cuarta al Este.
     "Diez pies."
Un árbol elevado era la seña principal. Ahora bien; precisamente frente
á nosotros, el ancladero estaba ceñido por una meseta de dos á
trescientos pies de elevación, juntándose hacia el Norte con la
pendiente Sur de "El Vigía" y alejándose otra vez, en dirección Sur,
hacia la eminencia abrupta y rocallosa designada con el nombre de Cerro
de Mesana. Toda la cima del declive estaba espesamente arbolada con
pinos de diversas alturas. Aquí y allá, alguno, de especie diferente, se
alzaba cuarenta ó cincuenta pies sobre las cumbres de los que lo
rodeaban... ¿cuál de estos era, entonces, el que estaba especialmente
designado por el Capitán Flint con el nombre de "árbol elevado?" Esto no
podía decidirse sino sobre el sitio mismo con las indicaciones precisas
de la brújula.
Pero aunque esto último era palmario, cada uno de los que tripulaban los
botes eligió su árbol favorito, antes de que estuviéramos á medio
camino, y sólo John Silver permanecía encogiéndose de hombros y diciendo
á sus gentes que se esperasen hasta estar en tierra.
Remamos sin hacer grandes esfuerzos, conforme á las instrucciones de
Silver, para no cansarnos prematuramente, y después de una travesía, no
muy corta por cierto, desembarcamos cerca de la boca del segundo
riachuelo, el que corre, tierra abajo, por una de las más arboladas
cuencas del "Vigía." Una vez desembarcados, volvimos nuestros pasos
sobre la izquierda y comenzamos á ascender el declive del terreno hacia
la meseta superior.
Al principio, un terreno pesado y cenagoso y una tupida vegetación de
marjal demoraron en gran manera nuestra marcha; pero poco á poco la loma
se iba escarpando un poco, ofreciéndonos ya camino un tanto pedregoso,
al par que la vegetación aparecía con otro carácter muy diverso,
presentando sus árboles en una disposición más abierta y ordenada.
Positivamente la parte de la isla en que íbamos entrando era la más
grata de toda ella. Finas retamas de un aroma delicioso y arbustillos
vestidos de flores habían ocupado casi enteramente el lugar del césped.
Pequeños boscajes de verdegueantes mimosas se apretaban aquí y allá
entre las erguidas columnas de los pinaletes y bajo su sombra
protectora, mezclando todos aquellos vegetales y flores sus esencias y
sus perfumes en un solo perfume que embriagaba los sentidos. La brisa,
además, era fresca y regeneradora, lo cual, bajo los destellos
clarísimos del sol, refrigeraba y tonificaba asombrosamente todos
nuestros sentidos.
Los expedicionarios se desparramaron en forma de abanico, gritando y
saltando como chicuelos. Hacia el centro y bastante atrás del cuerpo de
expedicionarios, seguíamos Silver y yo; él tropezando á cada paso en las
resbaladizas piedras, y yo, tras él, tirado por la cuerda á que me he
referido. Empero, de cuando en cuando me veía precisado á sostenerle,
porque, de lo contrario, hubiera perdido el pie y caído de espaldas,
loma abajo. De esta manera habíamos avanzado como por una media milla y
ya casi tocábamos al borde de la meseta cuando el hombre que caminaba
más alejado hacia nuestra izquierda comenzó á gritar con todas sus
fuerzas, con un marcado acento de terror. Una vez y otra y otra llamaba
á sus compañeros; ya éstos comenzaban á correr hacia él.
--Se me figura que no ha de haber encontrado la hucha, dijo el viejo
Morgan pasando del lado derecho junto á nosotros en dirección del que
gritaba. Esta es una cumbre muy pelada para haber hecho tal
descubrimiento.
Y en verdad que, cuando Silver y yo llegamos al sitio aquel, nos
encontramos con que era algo totalmente distinto. Al pie de un pino
bastante alto y medio envuelto en las espirales de una verde trepadora,
estaba un esqueleto humano, y á su lado, en el suelo, uno que otro
andrajo de vestido. La exuberancia de la enredadera había ya cubierto
algunos de los miembros de aquella osamenta. Me parece que un calofrío
involuntario se apoderó de todos nosotros, llegándonos hasta el corazón
en aquel momento.
--Este era un marinero, dijo Jorge Merry que más atrevido que los otros
se había acercado y examinaba los andrajos esparcidos por el suelo. Por
lo menos, esto no es más que un buen paño marino.
--¡Por vida mía!, dijo Silver, ¡me gusta el descubrimiento! ¿Acaso
podríamos esperar encontrarnos aquí el cuerpo de un arzobispo? Pero ¿qué
especie de postura es esa para un cadáver? Me parece muy poco ó nada
natural, ¿no creen Vds.?
Y ciertamente una segunda ojeada nos convenció de la inverosimilitud de
aquella postura extraordinaria. Por quién sabe qué causas, tal vez por
la obra de los pájaros que habían comido sus carnes, tal vez por la
acción de crecimiento de la enredadera, el hecho es que el hombre aquel
yacía perfectamente recto con sus pies apuntando en una dirección, y sus
manos tendidos paralelamente sobre su cabeza, señalando rígidamente en
dirección opuesta.
--Me acaba de entrar una idea en la vieja calavera, dijo Silver
chocarreramente. Aquí está la brújula; allí se ve la cima principal del
Islote del Esqueleto sobresaliendo como un gran colmillo: sigan Vds. la
dirección marcada por los huesos y tomen una visual hacia aquella punta.
Hízose como lo ordenó Silver. Las manos del esqueleto apuntaban
directamente hacia el Islote y la brújula marcó, con toda claridad: Este
Sudeste, cuarta al Este.
--Bien me lo figuré, exclamó el cocinero; este sujeto es un directorio.
Pues allí derecho tenemos la línea que nos guía hacia la estrella polar
y las benditas talegas. Pero lléveme el diablo si no me da calofrío el
pensar en el amigo Flint. Esta es una de las bromas que él usaba, no
cabe duda. Él y sus seis marineros vinieron solos hasta aquí: los seis
murieron á sus manos, sabe el demonio de qué manera, y á este le cupo en
suerte ser colocado aquí, de apuntador, con todas las medidas náuticas
muy bien tomadas, ¡voto al infierno! Esos huesos son muy largos y el
cabello parece haber sido amarillo. De seguro que este era Allan... ¿te
acuerdas de Allan, Tom Morgan?
--¡Vaya si me acuerdo!, contestó Morgan. Por cierto que me debía algunas
guineas que le presté, sí señor; y, además, se trajo consigo mi cuchilla
cuando bajó á tierra.
--Y á propósito de cuchilla, dijo otro, ¿por qué no encontramos la de
Allan, por aquí cerca de él, ni su dinero? El Capitán Flint no era
hombre que se entretuviera en recoger la bolsa de un marinero, y en
cuanto á los pájaros no me parece que excitara su codicia semejante
hallazgo.
--¡Por mi patrón Satanás!, exclamó Silver. Eso me parece muy racional.
--Pues no hay por todo esto ni trazas de cosa alguna, dijo Merry, que
registraba todavía en todo el derredor de la osamenta; ni un pobre
penique de cobre, ni nada parecido. Pues esto sí que no es natural.
--¡No, por vida mía!, agregó Silver; ni natural ni tranquilizador, ni
agradable en manera alguna. ¡Mil carronadas!, compañeros... la verdad es
que si Flint estuviera aún vivo, ya tendríamos aquí cuentas largas que
entregar. Seis eran los que le acompañaron; seis somos nosotros, y de
aquéllos, ya lo hemos visto, no quedan más que las osamentas.
--Yo lo ví muerto con estos ojos que se ha de comer la tierra, dijo
Morgan. Billy Bones me llevó á verlo. Tendido estaba allí con un penique
de cobre sobre cada ojo.
--¡Muerto, sí!, ya lo creo, y sepultado en los infiernos, dijo el herido
de la cabeza. Pero yo creo, de veras, que si alguna vez hubo ánima en
pena, ¡esa ha de ser el alma condenada de Flint! ¡Cáspita! ¡pues vaya si
tuvo una mala y horrible muerte aquel hombre!
--En cuanto á eso, ni quien lo dude, observó un tercero. En su agonía,
ya blasfemaba como un condenado, ya deliraba con el rom, ya prorrumpía
con una voz hueca como si saliera de la sepultura, en su canción eterna:
    "_¡Son quince los que quieren el cofre de aquel muerto!_"
Dijérase que no sabía otra canción más que esa y, la verdad, camaradas,
desde entonces no es mucho lo que me divierte esa canturria. Hacía un
calor horrible; la ventana del agonizante estaba abierta y yo podía oir
clara, cada vez más clara, la lúgubre tonada que el hombre dejaba
escapar, interrumpida por el hipo de la muerte, y ya con las sombras del
cadáver sobre el rostro...
¡Vamos, vamos!, dijo Silver, ¿quieres dejar semejante conversación?
Muerto está el hombre, muy bien muerto, y los que se mueren no vuelven,
que yo sepa; ó si vuelven no pasean de día; á lo menos, estemos seguros.
Se acabó el cuento: "¡entro por un caño dorado y salgo por otro, y
basta!" ¡Adelante! ¡adelante que la hucha nos espera!
Diciendo y haciendo, partimos otra vez. Pero á despecho del ardiente sol
y de la deslumbradora claridad, los piratas ya no marcharon separados,
corriendo y gritando por la espesura, sino todos juntos, apretados unos
contra otros y hablando con la respiración agitada. El terror del
filibustero difunto había caído como una sombra densa sobre sus
espíritus.

CAPÍTULO XXXII
LA VOZ DEL ALMA EN PENA
En parte por la influencia aterrorizadora de aquella alarma y en parte
para que descansaran Silver y sus compañeros enfermos, todos los
expedicionarios tomaron asiento en cuanto que hubimos ganado
definitivamente el borde superior de la meseta. Estando ésta un poco
empinada hacia el Oeste, el lugar en que nos habíamos detenido nos
descubría un ancho panorama á un lado y otro. Frente á nosotros, sobre
las cumbres de los árboles mirábamos el Cabo de la Selva con su inmensa
franja de espumantes ondas. Detrás no solamente dominábamos el ancladero
y el Islote del Esqueleto, sino que podíamos divisar por sobre la punta
arenosa en que está la _Peña blanca_, y por encima de las tierras bajas,
una gran extensión de mar abierto hacia el Oriente. Por cima de nosotros
se destacaba el "Vigía," ya matizado á trechos por pinos aislados, ya
negreando con profundos barrancos y desfiladeros. Ningún ruido llegaba
hasta allí, á no ser el monótono golpear de las rompientes lejanas
subiendo en oleadas de rumor incesante hasta nuestros oídos, y el
zumbido de insectos incontables bullendo en la espesura. Ni un hombre,
ni una vela en el océano: lo inmenso de aquel vasto panorama parecía
aumentar su triste soledad.
En cuanto que Silver se hubo sentado hizo ciertos cálculos con la
brújula.
--Hay tres "árboles elevados" dijo, hacia la dirección de la línea
marcada rectamente del Islote del Esqueleto. "La vertiente del Vigía,"
ya lo entiendo; esto significa aquel punto en declive hacia allá. Pues
ahora es ya un juego de niños el encontrar la hucha. Me parece, sin
embargo, que haríamos bien en comer primeramente.
--No me siento muy filoso, murmuró Morgan. Este pensamiento de Flint me
ha quitado el apetito. ¡Ah! si Flint estuviera vivo, yo podría darme ya
por muerto.
--Ah, vamos, hijo mío, dijo Silver; dale gracias á tu buena suerte.
Flint no tiene nada que hacer ya en este mundo.
--Era un diablo bien horroroso el tal Flint, exclamó el tercer pirata.
¡Con aquella eterna cara de murria!
--Fué el rom el que le produjo aquel tinte azulado y aquella expresión
de esplín; aunque "murria" como tú dices, me supongo que es una mejor
palabra.
Desde que habíamos descubierto el esqueleto de Allan y dado margen con
él á esta clase de pensamientos, la voz de los piratas había ido
bajando, bajando, hasta que, en aquel punto, ya no era casi más que un
ligero murmullo cuyo sonido escasamente podría decirse que interrumpiese
el silencio misterioso de la selva.
De repente, como del medio de los árboles que había frente á nosotros,
una voz aguda, penetrante, temblorosa, prorrumpió en la lúgubre y
conocida cantilena:
    "_Son quince los que quieren el cofre de aquel muerto,_
     _Son quince ¡yo--ho--hó! son quince ¡viva el rom!_"
Jamás he visto ni espero volver á ver hombres más horriblemente
asustados que los piratas. Como por arte de encantamiento sus caras se
quedaron, de súbito, lívidas como la cera: algunos se pusieron de pie;
algunos se asieron trémulos y trastornados al brazo ó á la ropa del más
cercano; Morgan murmuró, sin levantarse, palabras sin sentido.
--¡Ese es Flint, por el infierno!, exclamó Merry.
La canción aquella había cesado de una manera tan súbita como empezó;
cortada, podía decirse, como si alguien hubiera cubierto bruscamente con
su mano la boca del cantor. Viniendo de la distancia á que venía á
través de la atmósfera clara y luminosa y de entre las cumbres de los
árboles, me pareció á mí que la voz aquella había sonado dulce y airosa,
y lo que había que extrañar era el efecto producido sobre mis
compañeros.
--¡Vamos!, dijo Silver pugnando con sus labios cenicientos por hacer
salir las palabras, ¡Esa no pega! Á otro perro con ese hueso. Ese es
alguno que comienza á ponerse la mona y se va por allí haciéndonos la
calandria; es alguno que tiene su carne y huesos, no lo duden Vds.
Conforme hablaba le iba volviendo más y más el alma al cuerpo y con ella
el color al rostro. Los otros ya comenzaban también á dar oídos á su
envalentonamiento, y ya iban recobrándose poco á poco, cuando el mismo
acento prorrumpió de nuevo, esta vez ya no cantando, sino con un voceo
lejano que los ecos de las cuencas en el "Vigía" repetían muy
débilmente:
--¡Darby Grow!, gimió aquel acento, ¡Darby Grow! ¡Darby Grow!, y seguía
repitiendo aquel nombre; y luego en un diapasón un poco más alto y no
sin acompañar un horrible juramento, concluyó así: ¡Corre á traerme
rom; pronto Darby!
--Eso ya no deja duda, murmuró uno. ¡Vámonos!
--Esas fueron las últimas palabras de Flint, murmuró Morgan; sus últimas
palabras á bordo de este mundo.
Dick había sacado un Biblia y rezaba mecánicamente, como un maniaco.
Este pobre muchacho había recibido una mediana educación antes de venir
á la marina con tan malas compañías.
Sin embargo, Silver aún permanecía luchando. Sus dientes casi
castañeteaban de cuando en cuando, pero él no se rendía al terror ni
mucho menos.
--Nadie ha podido oir hablar en esta isla acerca de Darby, clamó; nadie
más que los que aquí estamos.
Pero luego, como para contrapesar esas palabras, prosiguió haciéndose un
esfuerzo:
--Camaradas: yo he venido aquí para encontrar esa hucha y ni alma en
pena ni hombre de carne y hueso podrán impedírmelo. Jamás, durante su
vida, tuve miedo al viejo Flint y ¡por Satanás mi patrón! yo le haré
frente hasta á su misma alma condenada. Á menos de un cuarto de milla de
aquí están setecientas mil libras en oro... ¿Cuándo se ha visto que un
caballero de la fortuna haya volteado la popa á una hucha de ese tamaño
nada más que por miedo á la memoria de un viejo borracho, con su
cubilete de rom, y ya muerto y enterrado?
Los piratas no daban señal alguna de reanimarse con este discurso; antes
bien pareció que la notoria irreverencia de aquellas palabras aumentaba
su terror.
¡Cuidado, cuidado, John!, dijo Merry. ¡No es bueno enojar á los
_espritus_!
En cuanto á los otros estaban sobrado aterrorizados para que pudiesen
contestar. Varios de ellos habrían emprendido una retirada á carrera
abierta si se hubieran encontrado con valor, siquiera para esto; pero el
miedo los hacía querer estarse juntos en torno de John, como si
encontraran ayuda en el valor de éste. Silver, por su parte, había ya
logrado sobreponerse bastante á su debilidad.
--_¿Spritu?_, dijo. ¡Bueno! Podría ser. Pero noto una cosa que no me
parece muy clara, y es que la voz del tal _espritu_ ha tenido un eco.
Ahora bien, yo digo que ningún hombre ha visto que las almas hagan
sombra. ¿Cómo podía entonces su voz hacer un eco? Quisiera averiguar
esto. Á mí, por lo pronto, no me parece natural.
Aquel argumento me pareció á mí bastante débil. Pero es imposible decir
qué cosas afectarán á la superstición; así es que, con no poca sorpresa
de mi parte, ví que Jorge Merry se mostraba muy consolado.
--¡Vaya! ¡pues de veras!, exclamó. John, Vd. lleva una verdadera cabeza
sobre sus hombros, no hay duda en eso. Á propósito, camaradas: esta
tripulación lleva su vela sobre una mala amura. Decíamos que esa voz se
parece á la de Flint; un poco, digo yo; pero á esa distancia tan larga
no era fácil juzgar tan bien del parecido. Puede ser muy bien la voz de
otro...
--¡Por el infierno!, gritó Silver; ¡ese fué Ben Gunn!
--Ben Gunn ha sido, le ha acertado Vd., dijo Morgan incorporándose hasta
ponerse de rodillas. ¡Ben Gunn y muy Ben Gunn!
--Pues ahora no tiene ya mucho de extraordinario, dijo Dick. Ben Gunn no
anda con nosotros, es verdad, pero supongo que tampoco andará con Flint.
Los de más edad en la compañía recibieron la sosa observación de Dick
con el más marcado desprecio.
--¡Y qué nos importa Ben Gunn!, exclamó Merry. Vivo ó muerto, aquí nadie
le tiene miedo á Ben Gunn.
Era cosa sorprendente el ver hasta qué punto había vuelto el ánimo á sus
corazones y el color natural á sus caras, poco antes lívidas. Poco rato
después ya estaban charlando unos con otros, si bien todavía de cuando
en cuando prestaban oído atentamente; más como no percibiesen ya sonido
alguno, concluyeron por echarse á cuestas todos sus aperos y la caravana
entera se puso de nuevo en marcha. Merry iba á la vanguardia llevando
consigo la brújula de Silver á fin de seguir, sin desviarse, la línea
recta tirada del Islote del Esqueleto. Jorge había dicho la verdad; vivo
ó muerto, nadie allí tenía miedo de Ben Gunn.
Dick, sin embargo, todavía conservaba su Biblia en la mano, como un
amuleto, y echaba en torno ojeadas llenas de temor; pero su cobardía no
encontró ya prosélitos, y Silver no le hizo poca burla á causa de sus
precauciones.
--Ya te lo había yo dicho, Dick, exclamaba el cocinero; ya te había yo
dicho que tu Biblia estaba profanada, y si tal como está ya no sirve ni
para jurar por ella, ¿qué fuerza quieres tú que tenga para libertarte de
un _espritu_? ¡Ninguna por cierto!
Pero Dick no estaba para oir razones: la verdad es que, según ya noté,
el pobre muchacho se estaba poniendo muy enfermo; la fiebre que el
Doctor le había anunciado en la mañana se apoderaba de él á toda prisa,
espoleada por el susto, el calor y la fatiga.
Ya sobre la cima, el terreno era abierto, y nuestro camino descendía un
poco, porque, como he dicho antes la meseta se inclinaba un tanto en
dirección del Oeste. Los pinos, pequeños y grandes, crecían á buena
distancia unos de otros, y aun entre los espesos lunarcillos de azaleas
y mimosas, quedaban grandes claros al descubierto en que el sol
reverberaba con insólita fuerza. Prosiguiendo como íbamos, en dirección
Noroeste, al través de la isla, nos acercábamos cada vez más, por una
parte, á los declives del "Vigía," y por otra á aquella bahía occidental
formada por el Cabo de la Selva en la cual había yo pasado tales
angustias á bordo del llevado y traído _coracle_.
Llegamos al primero de los grandes árboles, pero tomada la dirección con
la brújula resultó no ser aquél el que buscábamos. Lo mismo sucedió con
el segundo. El tercero se alzaba como á unos doscientos pies sobre la
cima de un boscaje de arbustos. Era este un verdadero gigante de los
bosques con una columna recta y majestuosa como los pilares de una
basílica y con una copa ancha y tupida bajo cuya sombra podría muy bien
haber maniobrado una compañía de soldados. Tanto desde el Este como
desde el Oeste podía distinguirse muy bien en el mar aquel coloso y
pudiera habérsele marcado en el mapa, como una señal marítima.
Pero no era por cierto su corpulencia imponente lo que impresionaba á
mis compañeros, sino la seguridad de que nada menos que setecientas mil
libras en oro yacían sepultadas en un punto cualquiera bajo el círculo
extenso de su sombra. La idea de las riquezas que les aguardaban
concluyó por dar al traste con todos sus terrores precedentes en cuanto
que se acercaban al sitio codiciado. Sus ojos lanzaban rayos; sus pies
parecían más ligeros y expeditos; su alma entera estaba absorta en la
expectativa de aquella riqueza fabulosa que había de asegurarles para
toda la vida una no interrumpida serie de extravagancias y placeres sin
límites, cuyas imágenes danzaban tumultuosamente en sus imaginaciones.
Silver gruñía, cojeando más que nunca, sobre su muleta; su nariz
aparecía ancha y dilatada, estremeciéndose de cuando en cuando; si una
mosca se paraba sobre cualquiera parte de su rostro, juraba y maldecía
como un poseído; tiraba furiosamente de la cuerda con que me llevaba
sujeto y de tiempo en tiempo echaba sobre mí ojeadas con que hubiera
querido aniquilarme. La verdad es que no se tomaba ya el menor trabajo
para disimular sus pensamientos, y á mí me era tan fácil leerlos como si
los llevara escritos sobre la frente. Á la aproximación del oro, todo
otro pensamiento se había borrado de su memoria; su promesa, las
advertencias del Doctor, todo era para él como no existente, y no me
cabía la menor duda de que su esperanza, en aquellos momentos, era
apoderarse del tesoro, encontrar y fletar _La Española_ á favor de la
oscuridad de la noche, degollar sin compasión á cuantas gentes honradas
había en la isla y hacerse á la mar, como lo había primeramente
meditado, con su doble cargamento de crímenes y de oro.
Impresionado con pensamientos tan poco consoladores, era para mí cosa
difícil el seguir el paso rápido y agitado de los buscadores de oro. De
vez en cuando tropezaba y entonces era cuando Silver daba violentos
tirones á la cuerda con que me conducía y me arrojaba, como dardos, sus
miradas asesinas. Dick que se había quedado á nuestra espalda y que, á
la sazón, formaba la retaguardia de la caravana, venía murmurando para
sí, todo mezclado, oraciones y juramentos. Esto no hacía más que
aumentar mi desazón y malestar y, para coronarlo todo, me acordé en
aquellos momentos de la tragedia que se había desenlazado una vez en esa
misma meseta, cuando aquel pirata sin Dios que murió en Savannah
cantando y pidiendo rom, había asesinado allí á sus seis cómplices. Ese
bosque, tan tranquilo y silencioso á la sazón, debió resonar entonces
con los alaridos de terror y de agonía de las víctimas sacrificadas,
alaridos que el terror hacía resonar á los oídos de mi imaginación.
Nos encontrábamos, en aquel momento, al borde del boscaje.
--¡Hurra, muchachos!, gritó Merry; ¡todos juntos!
Y al decir esto el hombre de vanguardia echó á correr.
Repentinamente, y antes de que hubiera avanzado diez yardas vimos al
grupo detenerse. Un grito ahogado se escapó de cada pecho. Silver
aceleró el paso, empujándose con el apoyo de la muleta á distancias
inverosímiles, y un momento después tanto él como yo habíamos tenido que
hacer alto como los demás.
Á nuestros pies se veía una gran excavación nada reciente, porque se
veían los costados de la fosa desprendidos, y en el fondo había ya
brotado el césped. Allí yacía, roto en dos pedazos, el mango de una
azada, y las tablas de varias cajas de empaque se miraban esparcidas
aquí y acullá. En una de esas tablas pude leer esta marca hecha con un
hierro candente: "_Walrus_," nombre del buque de Flint, como se
recordará quizás.
Aquello era claro como la luz del día. El escondite había sido
descubierto y explotado. ¡Las setecientas mil libras habían
desaparecido!

CAPÍTULO XXXIII
LA CAÍDA DE UN CAUDILLO
Jamás trastorno alguno en la vida ha sido más sentido que aquel. Se
diría que un rayo había herido á todos aquellos hombres. Pero á Silver
el golpe le pasó en un instante. Todas las facultades de su alma se
habían concentrado por un rato en aquel tesoro, es verdad; pero el
instinto le hizo recobrarse en un segundo: su cabeza se alzó firme, su
valor apareció al instante y ya había formado todo su plan cuando los
otros aún no acertaban á darse cuenta exacta del terrible chasco.
Y al punto, dándome una pistola de dos cañones, me dijo:
--Toma esto, Jim, y preparémonos para una querella.
Al mismo tiempo comenzó á trasladarse sin precipitación hacia el Norte,
y á pocos pasos ya había puesto la excavación entre nosotros y los otros
cinco. En seguida me dirigió una mirada y me hizo con el dedo una señal
muy significativa como diciendo: "Aquí se juega el pellejo," en lo cual
estaba yo de acuerdo. Empero sus miradas eran ya de todo punto
amistosas, y yo me sentí tan indignado con estos frecuentes cambios, que
no pude menos que decirle:
--Por lo visto ya es Vd. de los nuestros otra vez.
No tuvo tiempo para contestarme. Los filibusteros, con gritos y
maldiciones de todo género, comenzaban á brincar adentro del hoyo unos
tras de otros, cavando rabiosamente con sus propias uñas y haciendo caer
los bordes de la fosa al hacer esto. Morgan se encontró una pieza de
oro. Alzóla en sus manos con una verdadera explosión de juramentos: era
una moneda de valor de dos guineas y fué pasando de mano en mano durante
unos quince segundos.
--¡Dos guineas!, rugió Merry enseñando aquella pieza á Silver y
sacudiéndola en alto. ¿Son estas tus setecientas mil libras? ¡De veras
que eres tú el hombre para hacer contratos! Tú eres el que aseguras que
jamás empresa se ha echado á perder entre tus manos, viejo imbécil,
haragán, ¡cabeza de alcornoque!
--¡Escarben, escarben, muchachos!, gritó Silver con la más fría
insolencia; no me sorprenderá que todavía encuentren algunos cacahuates.
--¡Cacahuates!, repitió Merry en un grito salvaje. ¿Camaradas, lo han
oído Vds.? Pues ahora tengo la seguridad de que ese infame lo sabía
todo. No hay más que mirarle á la cara; allí le leo yo su traición.
--¡Hola, Merry!, le gritó Silver; ¿ya piensas proponerte de nuevo para
capitán? ¡Eres un chico emprendedo, no cabe duda!
Pero lo que es por esta vez todos estaban decididamente del lado de
Merry. Uno tras de otro, todos fueron echándose afuera de la excavación,
arrojando miradas furiosas tras de sí. Una cosa observé en aquellos
críticos momentos, que por cierto nos favorecía en gran manera, y es
que todos saltaban del lado opuesto al que ocupábamos Silver y yo.
Por fin, estábamos allí frente á frente, dos de un lado y cinco del
otro, con el socavón separando ambas facciones y sin que ninguna de
ellas pareciera resuelta á dar el primer golpe. Silver permanecía
inmóvil, observando simplemente al enemigo, erguido sobre su muleta y
con una frialdad que parecía inverosímil. Aquel bandido era valiente, no
cabe duda.
Merry, al cabo, creyó que un discurso aceleraría la conclusión de la
escena.
--Camaradas, dijo, allí están dos individuos solos de los cuales el uno
es el viejo derrengado, á quien trague el infierno, que se ha burlado de
nosotros trayéndonos á sufrir una decepción inmerecida. El otro no es
más que ese cachorro del diablo á quien pienso arrancarle por esta vez
hasta las entrañas. No hay temor, ¡á ellos, camaradas!...
Al decir esto alzó la voz y el brazo como para guiar al ataque; pero en
aquel mismo instante... ¡crac! ¡crac! ¡crac!, tres detonaciones de
mosquete sonaron casi simultáneamente y tres relámpagos se vieron
brillar en la espesura más cercana. Merry se desplomó de cabeza dentro
de la excavación; el hombre de la cara vendada dió vueltas girando como
una peonza que espira y cayó de lado cuan largo era, completamente
muerto, por más que todavía hiciera algunos movimientos, inconscientes
ya, después de caído. En cuanto á los tres restantes no esperaron nuevas
razones, sino que en el acto volvieron la espalda y se pusieron en
precipitada fuga, corriendo como ciervos espantados.
En un abrir y cerrar de ojos Silver había disparado los dos cañones de
una doble pistola sobre el agonizante Merry, y como este desdichado
levantase hasta él los ojos en sus últimas convulsiones, le gritó el
implacable cocinero:
--Me parece, Jorge, que te he ajustado las cuentas.
En el mismo instante, el Doctor, Gray y Ben Gunn salían, á reunírsenos,
de un bosquecillo de mimosas, trayendo entre las manos sus mosquetes
humeando todavía.
--¡Adelante, muchachos!, gritó el Doctor. No hay que perder un instante,
para impedirles que se apoderen de los botes: ¡adelante! ¡adelante!
Con esta excitativa tan apremiante partimos á paso veloz,
sumergiéndonos, algunas veces, hasta el pecho, en las espesuras de
retamas y matorrales de toda clase de yerbas.
Silver, en aquellas circunstancias, demostraba el mayor empeño por no
separarse de nosotros. Y lo que aquel viejo inválido hizo, abriéndose
paso por donde nosotros íbamos, saltando frenéticamente sobre su muleta
hasta hacer casi que se destrozaran los músculos de su pecho, todo eso
no lo habría podido hacer con más energía y resolución un hombre sano.
El Doctor fué de la misma opinión que yo en este particular. Con todo y
eso, cuando llegamos á la ceja de la mesa en vía de descender, el hombre
aquel venía á unas treinta yardas tras de nosotros y su fatiga era tal
que parecía á punto de ahogarse.
--Doctor, gritó: mire Vd. allá; ya no hay prisa ninguna.
En efecto, no la había. Por un claro bastante grande de la meseta
podíamos divisar á los tres fugitivos, corriendo todavía en la misma
dirección en que partieron, esto es, en derechura hacia el Cerro de
Mesana. Nosotros estábamos ya, á aquella hora, entre ellos y los botes,
por lo cual todos cuatro nos sentamos para tomar aliento, en tanto que
John Silver, enjugándose el rostro, llegaba, ya lentamente, hasta
nosotros.
--Doy á Vd. las más rendidas gracias, Doctor, dijo. Ha llegado Vd. en el
momento crítico, á lo que creo, para Hawkins y para mí. ¡Hola!, con que
Ben Gunn está también por aquí, ¿eh? ¡Bien! ¡bien! Tú eres un buen
chico, á no dudarlo.
--¡Ben Gunn, y muy Ben Gunn!, replicó el hombre de la isla, meneándose
como una anguila con un embarazo bastante visible.
Y luego, después de una pausa, añadió aquel mísero _aislado_:
--¿Y qué tal está Vd., Sr. Silver? Muy bien, dirá Vd., no es esto; ¡pues
tanto que me alegro!
--¡Ah! ¡Ben, Ben!, murmuró Silver. ¡Y pensar en la que nos has jugado!
El Doctor envió á Gray á que recogiera uno de los picos abandonados por
los piratas en su precipitada fuga, y en seguida fuimos ya bajando, con
todo despacio, hacia el punto en que los botes yacían amarrados, en cuyo
tiempo el mismo Doctor nos refirió, en pocas palabras, lo que había
pasado. Pero su narración interesó profundísimamente á Silver; sobre
todo al ver que, desde el principio hasta el fin, era el único héroe de
ella aquel Ben Gunn, el semi-idiota abandonado hacía tres años en la
isla.
Ben, en sus solitarias y vagabundas excursiones por la isla, había
encontrado el esqueleto de Allan y lo había despojado de sus armas y
dinero. Después había encontrado el tesoro; había hecho la excavación,
dejando en ella, por último, su azada rota y ya inútil; había cargado
sobre sus hombros todo el oro, en incontables viajes penosísimos, desde
el pie del gigantesco pino, hasta una gruta que él tenía en la loma de
las dos puntas, en el ángulo Nordeste de la isla y allí, por último, lo
tenía todo almacenado, dos meses hacía, perfectamente á salvo.
Cuando el Doctor se hubo hecho dueño de este secreto, en la tarde del
día del ataque, y al ver á la mañana siguiente desierto el ancladero, no
vaciló ya en ir á ver á Silver, darle el mapa que era ya perfectamente
inútil, y cederle todas las provisiones, puesto que la gruta de Ben Gunn
estaba abundantemente surtida con carne de cabras monteses y de venados,
salada por él mismo; sin reservarse, en una palabra, cosa alguna, á fin
de asegurarse la retirada del reducto hacia la colina de las dos puntas,
en donde no había el menor peligro de malaria y se mantendría una
vigilancia efectiva sobre el tesoro.
--En cuanto á tí, Jim, dijo, la cosa me podía mucho; pero yo hice lo que
me pareció mejor para los que habían permanecido fieles á su deber, y si
tú no estabas entre ellos, ¿de quién era la culpa?
Pero aquella mañana, comprendiendo que iba yo á verme envuelto en el
horrible desengaño que había preparado para los rebeldes, había corrido
hasta llegar á la gruta, y, dejando al Caballero para cuidar al Capitán,
había traído consigo al hombre _aislado_ y á Gray, y describiendo una
diagonal á través de la isla, se preparaba para estar á la mano, cerca
del gran pino. Pronto vió, sin embargo, que los sublevados le llevaban
la ventaja, y por tanto Ben Gunn, que ya casi volaba en aquellos
terrenos, como se recordará, fué despachado á vanguardia para que, solo
de por sí, hiciera lo posible por detener el avance de los sublevados.
En estas circunstancias fué cuando al hombre de la isla le ocurrió
prevalerse de la superstición de los piratas, y tuvo tal éxito en su
ensayo que el Doctor y Gray pudieron bien llegar al gran pino y
emboscarse cerca de él antes de que se presentaran los buscadores del
tesoro.
--¡Ah!, dijo Silver. Por lo visto ha sido para mí una gran fortuna el
tener á Jim conmigo. Á no ser por él, hubieran Vds. dejado hacer
picadillo al pobre viejo John, sin consagrarle un pensamiento siquiera,
¿no es verdad?
--¡Ni un pensamiento!, dijo el Doctor jovialmente.
Á este tiempo ya habíamos llegado á los botes. El Doctor, sirviéndose
del pico destruyó uno de ellos, y luego todos nos pusimos á bordo en el
restante y nos arreglamos para ir rodeando por mar hasta la Bahía del
Norte.
Era aquel un viaje de unas ocho ó nueve millas. Silver, aunque casi
muerto de fatiga, fué asignado á uno de los remos como todos nosotros, y
muy pronto ya iba nuestro esquife deslizándose ligero sobre un mar terso
y favorable. Antes de mucho ya habíamos pasado el estrecho, doblamos la
punta Sudeste de la isla, en torno de la cual, cuatro días antes,
habíamos remolcado tan penosamente _La Española_.
Cuando pasamos frente á la colina de los dos picos, pudimos ver la negra
boca de la gruta de Ben Gunn y una figura humana, de pie, cerca de ella,
recargándose sobre un fusil. Era el Caballero, á quien saludamos
ondeando nuestros pañuelos y lanzando tres hurras en los cuales la voz
de Silver se unió tan calurosamente como la de cualquiera de nosotros.
Tres millas más lejos y muy cerca de la entrada de la Bahía del Norte,
¿qué otra cosa habíamos de encontrar sino _La Española_ navegando sola?
La última creciente la había levantado de la posición en que la dejé, y
si hubiera dado la casualidad de que soplase un viento fuerte, ó que la
marea hubiese engendrado una corriente enérgica como sucedía en el
ancladero Sur, es seguro que jamás la habríamos vuelto á ver ó la
hubiéramos encontrado encallada en algún arrecife fuera de toda
probabilidad de ponerla de nuevo á flote. Tal como se nos presentaba,
había muy poco que reparar y componer, excepto el destrozo de la vela
mayor. Alistóse una nueva ancla y la tiramos á braza y media de agua y
en seguida todos volvimos al bote remando hacia la "Caleta del Rom," que
era el abrigo más próximo á la gruta del tesoro de Ben Gunn. Gray, sin
nadie más que lo acompañara, fué despachado de nuevo en el esquife hasta
_La Española_, á fin de que pasara en ella la noche en guardia.
Un ligero declive llevaba desde la playa de la caleta hasta la entrada
de la cueva. En la parte más alta el Caballero salió á nuestro
encuentro. Cordial y amable fué conmigo, omitiendo toda referencia á mi
escapatoria, lo mismo para alabarla que para condenarla. Al recibir el
saludo cortés de Silver, se puso encendido y dijo así:
--John Silver, es Vd. el más prodigioso villano é impostor que jamás
vivió sobre la tierra... un impostor monstruoso, sí señor. Se me ha
dicho que debo renunciar á perseguir á Vd. ante los tribunales. En hora
buena: no lo haré. Pero eso no impedirá que todos esos hombres que han
perecido pesen al cuello de Vd. como piedras de molino.
--Gracias de nuevo, gracias muy cordiales, señor, exclamó Silver
saludando otra vez.
--Le desafío á Vd. á que vuelva á pronunciar esas palabras, dijo con
vehemencia el Caballero. He allí una irrisión de mi deber. ¡Quédese Vd.
detrás de todos!
Dicho esto entramos todos á la gruta. Era esta una gran estancia bien
ventilada, con una fuentecilla y una represa pequeña de agua clara
circundada de helechos. El piso estaba enarenado. Ante un grande y
confortable fuego yacía el Capitán Smollet, y en un rincón más apartado,
mal iluminado por los resplandores oblícuos de la hoguera, advertí un
gran montón de monedas y un cuadrilátero formado con barras de oro.
Aquel era el tesoro de Flint que desde tan lejos habíamos venido á
buscar y que, á aquellas horas, había costado ya las vidas de diez y
siete de los tripulantes de _La Española_. ¿Cuántas más habría costado
el reunirlo, cuánta sangre vertida, cuántos amargos duelos ocasionados,
cuántos buques arrojados al fondo inmenso del océano, cuantos hombres
haciendo con los ojos vendados el horrible "paseo de la tabla," cuantos
cañonazos disparados, cuanta mentira, cuanto engaño, y cuantas
crueldades?... He aquí una cosa imposible de inquirir. Y sin embargo,
allí mismo, en aquella isla, andaban aún tres hombres que habían tenido
su participación en aquellos crímenes: Silver, el viejo Morgan y Ben
Gunn; y cada uno de ellos había esperado en vano tener su participación
en la recompensa.
--Ven acá, Jim, díjome el Capitán. Tú eres un buen muchacho en tu clase;
pero no creo que tú y yo volveremos juntos á la mar de nuevo. Eres
demasiado lo que se llama un niño mimado para que pudieras ir bajo mis
órdenes por mucho tiempo, ¿Es Vd., John Silver? ¿Qué vientos lo arrojan
á Vd. por acá, amigo?
--Vuelvo á mis obligaciones, señor, contestó Silver.
--¡Ah!, dijo el Capitán, y no añadió una palabra más.
¡Dios mío! ¡y qué cena que tuve aquella noche, junto á todos mis amigos,
con las carnes saladas por Ben Gunn y golosinas exquisitas traídas de
_La Española_, con más una botella de magnífico vino! Estoy seguro de
que jamás hubo sobre la tierra gentes más alegres y felices. Y con
nosotros estaba allí Silver, sentado detrás de nuestro grupo, casi fuera
del radio de luz de la hoguera, pero comiendo con gran apetito, listo
para levantarse y servir algo que hiciera falta y hasta uniéndose á
nuestras risas de una manera poco ruidosa; en una palabra, el mismo
hombre obsequioso, comedido y agradable que salió con nosotros de
Brístol.

CAPÍTULO XXXIV
SE CUENTA EL FIN DE ESTA VERDADERA HISTORIA
Á los primeros albores de la mañana siguiente ya todos estábamos en
movimiento y á la obra, porque lo cierto es que no era trabajo tan
sencillo el trasporte de toda aquella masa de oro por cerca de una
milla, en tierra, y por tres millas, en el bote, hasta llegar á _La
Española_, siendo como éramos tan escaso en número los operarios. Los
tres rebeldes escapados la víspera y que forzosamente permanecían aún en
la isla, no nos dieron ningún quehacer. Pusimos un centinela en el
declive de la loma para evitarnos una sorpresa, y por lo demás, nos
tranquilizaba la idea de que ya no deberían tener mucha gana de pelear
después de los sucesos de cuatro días infructuosos para ellos.
Con esta creencia, la obra del trasporte fué activada vigorosamente.
Gray y Ben Gunn iban y venían con el bote, mientras los restantes,
durante sus ausencias apilaban oro en la playa. Dos de aquellas barras
atadas con un cabo de cuerda hacían una carga suficiente para un hombre
formal, y puede creérseme que todos se sentían contentos hasta no poder
más de ir marchando lentamente con semejante carga. Por lo que hace á
mí, como no les era muy útil para el acarreo, me ocuparon todo el día
en la gruta en empacar las monedas en cajas y sacos que se habían
traído exprofeso para el objeto en _La Española_.
Como en la talega de Billy Bones, había allí la más extraña colección de
monedas, sólo que en cantidad infinitamente superior, por de contado, y
en mucha mayor variedad, al grado de que no creo haber gozado más en mi
vida que al separarlas y arreglarlas. Monedas francesas, inglesas,
españolas, portuguesas, Jorges y Luises, doblones y dobles guineas,
moidores y zequíes, con los retratos de todos los soberanos de Europa,
lo menos por un siglo; y extrañas piezas orientales marcadas con lo que
me parecía haces de cuerdas ó trocitos de telarañas, piezas circulares,
y otras agujereadas como si se las hubiera destinado á llevarse al
cuello á guisa de collar; casi todas las variedades de moneda conocida,
en una palabra, tenían sus representantes en aquella colección. En
cuanto al número, tengo por cierto que eran tan incontables como las
hojas que el otoño esparce; de tal suerte que la espalda me dolía ya
terriblemente de tanto estar inclinado y las uñas me punzaban con el
trabajo de la separación.
Un día y otro día repetíamos el mismo trabajo y á la llegada de cada
noche una verdadera fortuna se había llevado á bordo de _La Española_,
en tanto que otra fortuna más quedaba aún esperando para el día
siguiente. En cuanto á los tres rebeldes sobrevivientes, para nada nos
molestaron.
Por último--y creo que esto fué la tercera noche--el Doctor y yo
vagábamos por el declive de la loma en el punto en que pueden dominarse
desde ella todas las partes bajas de la isla, cuando en medio de la
oscuridad de la noche el viento trajo hasta nosotros un rumor entre
ahullido y canto. Fué una mera ráfaga lo que llegó á nuestros oídos y
luego se restableció de nuevo el silencio.
--Dios los tenga de su mano, dijo el Doctor; esos son los rebeldes.
--¡Borrachos, sí señor!, añadió la voz de Silver tras de nosotros.
Aquí es la oportunidad de decir que á Silver se le había dejado el pleno
goce de su libertad y que, á pesar de que tuvo que sufrir diarios y
constantes desaires, parecía él considerarse, una vez más, como un
dependiente querido y privilegiado. Lo cierto es que era de admirar la
prudencia con que sobrellevaba todas sus humillaciones y la invariable
urbanidad con que trataba de congraciarse con todos. Sin embargo, tengo
entendido que nadie lo trató mejor que si hubiese sido un perro; á no
ser Ben Gunn, que continuaba sintiendo un terror pánico por su antiguo
contramaestre, y yo que, en realidad, tenía algo que agradecerle, si
bien es cierto que aun en esto podía yo haberme sentido tan predispuesto
como otro cualquiera en contra suya, puesto que recordaba muy bien
haberle visto meditando en la meseta una nueva traición en contra mía.
En virtud de esto, no fué sino muy ásperamente que el Doctor le
respondiera:
--Borrachos ó delirando, ¿qué sabe Vd.?
--Tiene Vd. razón que le sobra, replicó John. Pero lléveme el diablo si
ni á mí ni á Vd. nos importa que sea lo uno ó lo otro.
--No creo que tenga Vd. muchas pretensiones á ser considerado un miembro
real de la humanidad, dijo el Doctor, con una mirada de desprecio para
su interlocutor; por lo mismo, Maese Silver, es muy probable que mis
sentimientos le sorprendan á Vd.; pero si yo tuviera la certeza moral de
que los tres están delirando, como la tengo de que uno, por lo menos,
debe estar postrado por la fiebre, crea Vd. que dejaría al punto este
campo y á riesgo de mi propio pellejo, iría á llevarles los auxilios de
mi profesión.
--Vd. me perdonará mucho, señor, si le digo que ese sería un gran error,
añadió Silver. Vd. perdería con toda certeza su preciosa vida y no le
quepa á Vd. duda de ello. Yo estoy ahora en las filas de Vds., en cuerpo
y alma, y no consentiría yo jamás en que se debilitara nuestra fuerza,
dejando á Vd. ir solo, á Vd. á quien muy bien sé todo lo que debo.
Además, aquellos hombres no sabrían nunca mantener su palabra, aun
suponiendo que se lo propusieran, y--lo que es peor todavía--nunca
podrían tener fe en la promesa de un hombre de honor como Vd.
--Es verdad, dijo el Doctor; pero, en cuanto á hombres que cumplen su
palabra, allí está Vd. que se pinta solo para ello.
Ahora bien, aquellas fueron casi las últimas noticias que tuvimos de los
tres piratas. Sólo una vez oímos un disparo lejano, y supusimos que
andarían cazando. Celebramos, á propósito de ellos, consejo de guerra, y
se les sentenció á ser abandonados en la isla, con indecible regocijo de
Ben Gunn y con la más cordial aprobación de Gray. Les dejamos un
abundante surtido de pólvora y balas, todas las provisiones de carne
salada por Ben, algunas medicinas, ropa, una pequeña vela, algunas
brazas de cuerda, aperos de labranza y otros muchos útiles y, por deseo
expreso del Doctor, una buena cantidad de tabaco como el mejor regalo,
según él.
Esto fué casi ya lo último que hicimos en la Isla del Tesoro. Antes de
esto ya habíamos embarcado cuidadosamente todo el oro, lo mismo que agua
en abundancia, y víveres de sobra para el caso de algún accidente, por
lo cual, en una mañana, por cierto muy hermosa, levamos el ancla, que
era todo lo que nos restaba que hacer; y levantando al tope de nuestro
palo mayor la misma bandera que izara el Capitán en la empalizada y bajo
la cual peleamos, salimos mansamente afuera de la Bahía del Norte.
Los tres rebeldes deben haber estado á la mira de nuestros movimientos
más cerca de lo que nosotros creíamos. Comprobó este aserto el hecho de
que, al cruzar el estrecho que da paso al mar abierto, tuvimos que ir
casi costeando la punta Sur y allí los divisamos á todos tres en una
pequeña eminencia de arena, arrodillados, y tendiéndonos los brazos con
aire suplicante. Lo que hacíamos era muy en contra de nuestros
sentimientos, dejándolos en aquella isla salvaje y abandonada; pero era
imposible exponernos á los riesgos de un nuevo motín á bordo, y
llevarlos á bordo para entregarlos al verdugo en Inglaterra hubiera sido
una compasión de una especie enteramente cruel. El Doctor les dió voces
avisándoles de las provisiones de todo género que les dejábamos y el
punto en donde podrían encontrarlas. Empero ellos continuaban
llamándonos á todos por nuestros nombres con unos gritos que partían el
corazón, y pidiéndonos que por el amor de Dios no los condenáramos á
morir en semejante paraje.
Por último, viendo que el buque seguía inflexiblemente su marcha y se
iba ya poniendo fuera del alcance de la voz, uno de ellos, que bien sé
cual fué, se puso en pie de un salto lanzando un grito ronco, apoyó el
mosquete en su hombro, apuntó é hizo fuego, lanzando una bala que pasó
casi rozando la cabeza de Silver y perforó la vela mayor.
Después de esto nos pusimos á cubierto tras la balaustrada de cubierta,
y cuando, algún rato después, saqué la cabeza para verlos, habían ya
desaparecido de sobre la eminencia de arena, y la eminencia misma se fué
perdiendo poco á poco en la bruma de la distancia. Aquel fué, en
realidad, el fin del drama representado en la Isla del Tesoro; y como á
eso de mediodía, con indecible regocijo de mi ánima, la punta más
elevada, la del "Vigía," se sumergía, por fin, en la azul inmensidad del
océano.
Nuestra tripulación era tan escasa que cada uno de nosotros tenía
precisión de prestar su ayuda personal á la maniobra, excepto el Capitán
que tendido á popa sobre un colchón, daba sus órdenes con toda
propiedad, pues aunque ya muy mejorado de su grave herida, tenía aún que
guardar una inmovilidad casi absoluta.
Hicimos proa á uno de los puertos más inmediatos de la América española,
porque no nos era posible arriesgarnos á hacer todo el viaje sin
tripulantes de refresco, pues aun en aquella corta travesía nos bastó
tener uno ó dos días de malos vientos y unas dos fugadas recias para que
casi todos quedáramos, como quien dice, fuera de combate.
Era precisamente la puesta del sol, cuando tiramos el ancla en un
precioso golfo admirablemente protegido, y al punto nos vimos rodeados
por lanchones de indígenas y negros y mestizos que vendían frutas y
legumbres de toda especie y ofreciéndonos bucear, para divertirnos, por
recompensas verdaderamente miserables. La vista de tantos rostros
placenteros y amigables, especialmente los de los negros; el gustar las
deliciosas frutas tropicales y, sobre todo, las luces que comenzaban á
brillar en la población en calles, puertas y ventanas, me hacían sentir
la inmensidad del contraste más grato con nuestra sangrienta estancia en
la isla. El Doctor y el Caballero, llevándome consigo, bajaron á tierra
con el ánimo de pasar en ella las primeras horas de la noche. Pero una
vez allí encontraron al Capitán de un buque de guerra inglés anclado en
la bahía, entraron en conversación con él, fueron á bordo de su navío y,
en una palabra, se divirtieron tanto y tan bien que sería como el
amanecer del día siguiente cuando volvimos á bordo de _La Española_.
Ben Gunn estaba solo sobre cubierta y, no bien hubimos entrado á bordo,
cuando comenzó con las más estrambóticas contorsiones á hacernos una
confesión. Silver se había marchado. El hombre de la isla había
favorecido su escape en un lanchón costanero, hacía algunas horas, y
ahora nos aseguraba que lo había hecho así con el solo ánimo de salvar
nuestras vidas, que de seguro habrían corrido riesgo inmenso si aquel
"marino de una sola pierna" hubiera seguido á bordo. Pero no era eso
todo. El cocinero no se había marchado con las manos vacías. Había hecho
un agujero disimuladamente y se había sacado uno de los sacos que
contenían unas quinientas guineas, para ayudarse seguramente en sus
correrías posteriores. Creo, de veras, que todos nos sentimos
archisatisfechos de vernos libres de él á tan poca costa.
Ahora bien, para abreviar lo que aún queda por referir, diré que
contratamos allí algunos nuevos y honrados marinos para completar
nuestra tripulación; que hicimos una travesía feliz, y que _La Española_
tiró el ancla en Brístol, precisamente en momentos en que ya el Sr.
Blandy comenzaba á pensar en la precisión de enviar otro buque en busca
nuestra. Sólo cinco de las personas que habían partido en la goleta
volvían en ella,
    "_El diablo y la bebida hicieron, todo el resto,_"
con la añadidura de una venganza. Sin embargo, á no caber la menor duda,
nuestra condición no era tan mala, ni con mucho, como la de aquel navío
del que decía la canción que
    "_No tornó á bordo sino un hombre vivo,_
     _Cuando eran, al zarpar, setenta y cinco._"
Todos nosotros recibimos una porción considerable del tesoro, y la
usamos, ya cuerda, ya tontamente, según nuestras respectivas
inclinaciones. El Capitán Smollet vive ahora retirado ya del mar, en una
posición cómoda y desahogada; Gray, no solo guardó su dinero, sino que
sintiendo el deseo vivo de acrecerlo, estudió cuidadosamente su
profesión, y ahora es piloto y propietario, en parte, de un grande y
magnífico buque mercante. Además, se ha casado, y es padre de una
familia enteramente dichosa. En cuanto á Ben Gunn, le tocaron cinco mil
libras, que dilapidó con una prontitud asombrosa, encontrándose, al cabo
de pocas semanas, pidiendo limosna para vivir. Entonces se le dió
precisamente lo que él tanto repugnaba en la isla; esto es, la
conserjería de una casa, en la cual vive á estas horas siendo el gran
favorito de todos los chicuelos de la vecindad á quienes embelesa con la
narración de sus hazañas y aventuras. Por lo demás, su piadosa
costumbre de orar los domingos en el agreste cementerio de la isla, le
ha conducido á ser ahora un excelente cantor en la iglesia, lo mismo los
domingos que en las fiestas de los grandes santos.
De Silver jamás volvimos á saber ni una palabra. Aquel formidable
"marino de una sola pierna," había, por fin, desaparecido del escenario
de mi vida. Pero no sería extraño que al cabo se hubiese reunido con su
mulata y tal vez á la hora de esta vive aún cómodamente con ella y en la
inseparable sociedad de su loro. Quiero creerlo así, porque si en esta
vida no le es dable gozar algo, lo que es en la otra, mucho me temo que
no le espere cosa alguna que sea de envidiarse.
La gran barra de plata y las armas aún permanecen, á lo que me figuro,
en el mismo lugar en que el terrible pirata las sepultara, y
permanecerán allí ciertamente hasta que yo vaya por ellas. Empero ni
monjas y frailes descalzos me persuadirán á que vaya de nuevo á aquel
maldito lugar. Créaseme que las más siniestras pesadillas que suelen aún
turbar el reposo de mis tranquilas noches, son aquellas en que me veo
trasportado á la Isla del Tesoro, y oigo el sordo mugido de la mar
estrellándose en sus escarpadas costas, hasta que me despierto sudoroso
sobre mi lecho tan luego como la pesadilla me hace oir la voz aguda y
penetrante de _Capitán Flint_, gritando desesperadamente: "¡Piezas de á
ocho! ¡Piezas de á ocho! ¡Piezas de á ocho!"

Vorbemerkung
Josefine Mutzenbacher -- ihr Name lautete in Wirklichkeit ein wenig
anders -- wurde zu Wien, in der Vorstadt Hernals am 20. Februar 1852
geboren. Sie stand frühzeitig unter sittenpolizeilicher Kontrolle, und
übte ihr Gewerbe zuerst in wohlfeilen Freudenhäusern, der äußeren
Bezirke, dann im Dienste einer Kupplerin, die während des
wirtschaftlichen Aufschwungs- und Ausstellungsjahres 1873 die vornehmere
Lebewelt mit Mädchenware versorgte.
Josefine verschwand damals mit einem Russen aus Wien, kehrte nach
wenigen Jahren wohlhabend und glänzend ausgestattet in ihre Vaterstadt
zurück, wo sie als Dirne der elegantesten Sorte noch bis zum Jahre 1894
ein auffallendes und vielbemerktes Dasein führte.
Sie bezog dann in der Nähe von Klagenfurt ein kleines Gut, und
verbrachte ihre Tage in ziemlicher Einsamkeit, zu der sich dann bald
auch ihre Erkrankung gesellte. Während dieser Krankheit, einem
Frauenleiden, dem Josefine später auch erlag, schrieb sie die Geschichte
ihrer Jugend.
Das Manuskript übergab sie, etliche Wochen vor der schweren Operation,
an deren Folge sie starb, ihrem Arzt. Es erscheint hier als ein seltenes
Dokument seelischer Aufrichtigkeit, als ein wertvolles und sonderbares
Bekenntnis, das auch kulturgeschichtlich für das Liebesleben der
Gegenwart Interesse verdient. An den Bekenntnissen der Josefine
Mutzenbacher wurde im Wesentlichen nicht viel geändert. Nur sprachliche
Unrichtigkeiten, stilistische Fehler wurden verbessert, und die Namen
bekannter Persönlichkeiten, die Josefine in ihren Äußerungen meint,
durch andere ersetzt.
Sie starb den 17. Dezember 1904 in einem Sanatorium.

ERSTES KAPITEL
Man sagt, daß aus jungen Huren alte Betschwestern werden. Aber das
trifft bei mir nicht zu. Ich bin frühzeitig zur Hure geworden, ich habe
alles erlebt, was ein Weib im Bett, auf Tischen, Stühlen, Bänken, an
kahle Mauerecken gelehnt, im Grase liegend, im Winkel dunkler Haustore,
in chambres séparées, im Eisenbahnzug, in der Kaserne, im Bordell und im
Gefängnis überhaupt nur erleben kann, aber ich bereue nichts von
alledem. Ich bin heute bei Jahren, die Genüsse, die mein Geschlecht mir
bieten kann, sind im Entschwinden begriffen, ich bin reich, bin
verblüht, und sehr oft ganz vereinsamt. Aber es fällt mir nicht ein,
obgleich ich immer fromm und gläubig gewesen bin, jetzt Buße zu tun. Aus
Armut und Elend wie ich entstammt bin, habe ich alles meinem Körper zu
verdanken. Ohne diesen gierigen, zu jeder Sinnenlust frühzeitig
entzündeten, in jedem Laster von Kindheit auf geübten Körper, wäre ich
verkommen, wie meine Gespielinnen, die im Findelhaus starben oder als
abgerackerte, stumpfsinnige Proletarierfrauen zugrunde gingen. Ich bin
nicht im Dreck der Vororte erstickt. Ich habe mir eine schöne Bildung
erworben, die ich nur einzig und allein der Hurerei verdanke, denn diese
war es, die mich in Verkehr mit vornehmen und gelehrten Männern brachte.
Ich habe mich aufklären lassen und gefunden, daß wir armen, niedrig
geborenen Weiber nicht so viel Schuld haben, als man uns einreden
möchte. Ich habe die Welt gesehen und meinen Gesichtskreis erweitert,
und alles das verdanke ich meinem Lebenswandel, den man einen
»lasterhaften« nennt. Wenn ich meine Schicksale jetzt aufschreibe, so
tue ich das nur, die Stunden meiner Einsamkeit damit zu kürzen, und was
mir jetzt abgeht, aus der Erinnerung wenigstens herbeizuschaffen. Ich
halte das für besser als bußfertige Erbauungsstunden, die meinem Pfarrer
wohl gefielen, die mir aber nicht zu Herzen gingen und mir nur eine
grenzenlose Langeweile bereiten würden. Auch finde ich, daß der
Lebensgang von Meinesgleichen nirgends aufgeschrieben steht. Die Bücher,
die ich danach durchsucht habe, erzählen nichts davon, und es wäre
vielleicht doch gut, wenn die vornehmen und reichen Herren, die sich an
uns ergötzen, die uns locken und sich von uns alle unmöglichen Dinge
aufbinden lassen, einmal erfahren würden, wie es in einem jener Mädchen
aussieht, die sie so brünstig in ihre Arme schließen, woher es stammt,
was es erlebt hat, und was es denkt.

Mein Vater war ein blutarmer Sattlergehilfe, der in einem Geschäft in
der Josefstadt arbeitete. Wir wohnten ganz weit draußen in Ottakring, in
einem damals neuen Hause, einer Zinskaserne, die von oben bis unten mit
armen Leuten angefüllt war. Alle diese Leute hatten viele Kinder, und im
Sommer war der Hof zu klein für ihre Schar. Ich selbst besaß zwei
Brüder, die beide um wenige Jahre älter waren als ich. Mein Vater, meine
Mutter, wir drei Kinder wohnten in einer Küche und einem Zimmer und
hatten noch einen Bettgeher mit dazu. Solche Bettgeher waren der Reihe
nach wohl ein halbes hundert bei uns; sie kamen und gingen, bald
friedlich, bald in Streit, und die meisten von ihnen verschwanden
spurlos, ohne daß wir jemals wieder etwas von ihnen hörten. Ich erinnere
mich hauptsächlich an zwei von ihnen. Der eine war ein Schlossergeselle,
ein schwarzer, traurig aussehender Bursche, der ganz kleine schwarze
Augen hatte, und immer voll Ruß im Gesicht war. Wir Kinder fürchteten
uns vor ihm. Er war auch immer schweigsam und sprach kein Wort. Ich
entsinne mich, daß er eines Nachmittags nach Hause kam, während ich
allein in der Wohnung mich befand. Ich war damals fünf Jahre alt und
spielte am Boden des Zimmers. Meine Mutter war mit den beiden Buben am
Fürstenfeld, mein Vater von der Arbeit noch nicht zurück. Der Schlosser
nahm mich vom Boden auf und hielt mich auf seinem Schoß. Ich wollte
schreien, aber er sagte leise: »Sei stad, ich tu' dir nix!« Und dann
legte er mich zurück, hob mein Röckchen auf, und betrachtete mich, wie
ich nackt vor ihm auf seinen Knien lag. Ich fürchtete mich sehr vor ihm,
aber ich verhielt mich ganz still. Wie er meine Mutter kommen hörte,
setzte er mich rasch auf den Fußboden und ging in die Küche. Ein paar
Tage später kam er wieder frühzeitig nach Hause und die Mutter ersuchte
ihn auf mich aufzupassen. Er versprach es, und hielt mich wieder die
ganze Zeit auf seinen Knien, in Betrachtung meines nackten Mittelstückes
begriffen. Er sprach kein Wort, sondern schaute nur immer auf die eine
Stelle hin, und ich traute mich auch nicht, etwas zu reden. Das
wiederholte sich, solange er bei uns wohnte, einigemale. Ich begriff
nichts davon, und machte mir auch, nach Kinderart, keine Gedanken
darüber. Heute weiß ich, was das bedeutet hat, und nenne den
Schlossergesellen oft meinen ersten Geliebten.
Von dem zweiten Bettgeher werde ich später reden.
Meine beiden Brüder Franz und Lorenz waren sehr ungleich. Lorenz, der
älteste, er war um vier Jahre älter als ich, war immer sehr
verschlossen, in sich gekehrt, fleißig und heilig. Franz, der nur
anderthalb Jahre mehr zählte als ich, war dagegen lustig, und er hielt
sich auch viel mehr zu mir als zum Lorenz. Ungefähr sieben Jahre war ich
alt geworden, als ich eines Nachmittags mit Franz zu Nachbarskindern auf
Besuch ging. Es war auch ein Bruder und eine Schwester, und diese Kinder
waren immer allein, weil sie keine Mutter hatten, und ihr Vater in die
Arbeit gehen mußte. Die Anna war damals schon neun Jahre alt, ein
blasses, mageres, weißblondes Mädchen mit einer gespaltenen Lippe. Und
ihr Bruder Ferdl, ein dreizehnjähriger, robuster Bub, auch ganz
weißblond, aber rotwangig und breitschultrig. Wir spielten zuerst ganz
harmlos. Da sagte die Anna auf einmal: »Spiel'n wir doch Vater und
Mutter.« Ihr Bruder lachte und sagte: »Die will immer nur Vater und
Mutter spielen.« Aber Anna bestand darauf, trat zu meinem Bruder Franz
und meinte: »Also du bist der Mann und ich bin die Frau.« Und Ferdl war
gleich bei mir, faßte mich am Arm und erklärte: »Da bin dann halt ich
dein Mann und du meine Frau.« Sofort nahm Anna zwei Polsterüberzüge,
machte zwei Wickelkinder daraus, und gab mir eines. »Da hast dazu ein
Kind«, meinte sie. Ich begann die Lappendocke gleich zu wiegen, aber
Anna und Ferdl lachten mich aus. »So geht das nicht. Z'erst muß man das
Kind machen, dann muß man in der Hoffnung sein, dann muß man es kriegen,
und dann erst kann man's hutschen!« Ich hatte natürlich schon manchmal
davon reden gehört, daß Frauen »in der Hoffnung« sind, daß sie ein Kind
kriegen werden. An den Storch glaubte ich auch nicht mehr so recht, und
wenn ich Frauen mit einem großen Bauch sah, wußte ich ungefähr, was das
bedeutet. Aber genauere Vorstellungen davon hatte ich bisher nicht
gehabt. Auch mein Bruder Franz nicht. Wir standen deshalb gänzlich
verdutzt und ratlos da, und wußten nicht, wie wir dieses Spiel werden
versuchen, oder uns daran beteiligen können. Aber Anna war schon zu
Franz getreten und griff nach seinem Hosentürl. »Komm nur«, sagte sie,
»tu ihn heraus, dein' Zipfel!« Und dabei hatte sie ihm die Hose auch
gleich aufgeknöpft und seinen »Zipfel« zum Vorschein gebracht. Ferdl und
ich sahen zu. Ferdl lachend. Ich mit einem Gefühl, das aus Neugierde,
Staunen, Entsetzen und noch einer besonderen, mir bisher fremden
Erregung gemischt war. Franz stand ganz bewegungslos da, und wußte
nicht, wie ihm geschah. Unter Annas Berührung richtete sich sein
»Zipfel« ganz steif in die Höhe. »Jetzt komm«, hörte ich Anna leise
flüstern. Ich sah, wie sie sich auf den Boden warf, ihre Röcke hob und
die Beine spreizte. In diesem Moment ergriff mich Ferdl. »Leg dich
nieder«, zischelte er mir zu, und dabei spürte ich auch schon seine Hand
zwischen meinen Beinen. Ganz willig legte ich mich auf den Boden, hatte
meine Röcke aufgeschlagen, und Ferdl rieb sein steifes Glied an meiner
Fut. Ich mußte lachen, denn sein Schwanz kitzelte mich nicht wenig, weil
er mir auch auf dem Bauch und sonst überall herumfuhr. Er keuchte dabei,
und lag schwer auf meiner Brust. Mir kam das Ganze unsinnig und
lächerlich vor, nur eine kleine Aufregung war in mir, und nur dieser
allein ist es wohl zuzuschreiben, daß ich liegen blieb, ja sogar
ernsthaft wurde. Ferdl wurde plötzlich ruhig und sprang auf. Ich erhob
mich gleichfalls, und er zeigte mir jetzt seinen »Zipfl«, den ich ruhig
in die Hand nahm. Ein kleiner heller Tropfen war auf der Spitze zu
sehen. Dann zog Ferdl die Vorhaut zurück, und ich sah die Eichel zum
Vorschein kommen. Ich schob nun die Vorhaut ein paarmal hin und her,
spielte damit, und freute mich, wenn die Eichel, wie der rosige Kopf
eines kleinen Tieres hervorspitzte. Anna und mein Bruder lagen noch auf
dem Boden, und ich sah, wie Franz ganz aufgeregt hin und her wetzte. Er
hatte rote Wangen und keuchte, ganz wie Ferdl vorhin. Aber auch Anna war
ganz verändert. Ihr bleiches Gesicht hatte sich gefärbt, ihre Augen
waren geschlossen, und ich glaubte, ihr sei schlecht geworden. Dann
wurden die beiden auch plötzlich still, lagen ein paar Sekunden
aufeinander, und standen dann auf. Wir saßen eine Weile zusammen. Ferdl
hielt mich unter den Röcken mit der Hand an der Mitte, Franz tat
dasselbe mit Anna. Ich hatte Ferdls Schwanz in der Hand, Anna den meines
Bruders; und es war mir ganz angenehm, wie Ferdl bei mir herumfingerte.
Es kitzelte mich, aber nicht mehr so, daß ich lachen mußte, sondern so,
daß mir ein Wohlgefühl durch den ganzen Körper lief. Diese Beschäftigung
wurde von Anna unterbrochen, die jetzt die beiden Puppen nahm, von denen
sie die eine sich selbst unter das Kleid auf den Bauch legte, die andere
mir. »So«, sagte sie. »Jetzt sind wir in der Hoffnung.« Wir zwei gingen
nun im Zimmer herum, streckten unsere ausgestopften Bäuche heraus und
lachten darüber. Dann brachten wir unsere Kinder zur Welt, wiegten sie
in den Armen, gaben sie unseren Ehemännern, damit sie sie halten und
bewundern sollten, und spielten eine Weile wie unschuldige Kinder. Anna
kam auf die Idee, daß sie ihr Kind säugen müsse. Sie knöpfte ihre Jacke
auf, zog das Hemd herab und tat so, als ob sie einem Kind die Brust
reichen würde. Ich bemerkte, daß sie schon leise anschwellende Warzen
hatte; und ihr Bruder trat hinzu und spielte damit; auch Franz machte
sich bald an Annas Brust zu schaffen, und Ferdl meinte, es sei schade,
daß ich keine Duteln habe. Dann kam eine Erklärung vom Kindermachen. Wir
erfuhren, daß das, was wir eben getan hatten vögeln heiße, daß unsere
Eltern dasselbe tun, wenn sie miteinander im Bett liegen, und daß die
Frauen davon die Kinder bekämen. Ferdl war schon ein Ausgelernter. Er
sagte uns Mädchen, daß unsere Fut noch zugewachsen sei, daß man deshalb
nur von außen daran herumwetzen könne. Er sagte ferner, daß wir einmal,
wenn wir größer werden, Haare darauf bekommen, daß dann unser Loch sich
öffnen wird, und daß man dann mit dem ganzen Schwanz hineinfahren können
wird. Ich wollte es nicht glauben, aber Anna erklärte mir, Ferdl wisse
das ganz genau. Er habe auf dem Boden die Frau Reinthaler gevögelt, und
da sei sein Schwanz ganz in ihr Loch hineingegangen. Die Frau Reinthaler
war die Frau eines Tramwaykondukteurs, der in unserem Haus im letzten
Stock wohnte. Es war eine dicke, schwarze Frau, klein und hübsch und
immer sehr freundlich. Ferdl erzählte uns die Geschichte: »Die Frau
Reinthaler ist vom Waschen 'kommen. Ein' ganzen Korb voller Wäsch' hats
'tragen, und ich bin g'rad auf der Stieg'n g'wesen. Na, und wie ichs
grüßt hab' sagt sie zu mir: `Geh Ferdl, bist ein starker Bub, könntst
mir wirklich helfen, den schweren Korb am Boden tragen.´ So bin ich halt
mit ihr auffi gangen, und wie wir droben sein, fragt sie mich, `was
willst denn jetzt dafür, daß du mir g'holfen hast?´ -- `Nix´, sag ich
drauf. `Komm, ich zeig' dir was´, sagt sie, packt mich bei der Hand und
legt sich's auf die Brust. `Gelt ja, das ist gut?´ Da hab' ich schon
g'wußt, was los ist, denn mit der Anna hab' ich ja schon oft früher
gewetzt -- was?« -- Anna nickte bekräftigend, als ob sich das alles ganz
von selbst verstünde, Ferdl fuhr fort: »Aber ich hab' mich doch nicht
getraut, und hab' nur ihre Brust fest z'sammendruckt. Sie hat sich
gleich ihr Leibl aufg'macht, und hat mir's alser nackter herausgeben,
und hat mich spielen lassen, und dann hat's mich bei der Nudel packt,
und hat alleweil gelacht, und hat g'sagt: `Wenn's d' niemanden was
ausplauschen möchst, derfest noch was andres tun ...´ -- `Ich red' nix´,
hab' ich drauf g'sagt, -- `g'wiß nix?´ fragt sie noch amal. `Nein, g'wiß
nix.´ Na da hat sie sich übern Wäschkorb g'legt, und hat mich auf sich
g'nommen, und hat mir den Schwanz mit der Hand hineingesteckt in ihre
Fut. Ganz drinn war er, ich hab's ganz genau g'spürt. Und die Haar, was
sie drauf hat, hab' ich auch g'spürt.«
Anna wollte noch nicht, daß die Erzählung aus sei. »War's gut?« forschte
sie weiter. »Sehr gut war's«, antwortete Ferdl trocken, »und g'stoßen
hat sie, wie nicht g'scheit, und druckt hat's mich, und mit ihre Duteln
hab' ich spielen müssen. Und wie's dann aus war, is sie rasch
aufg'sprungen, hat sich ihr Leibl zuknöpfelt und hat ein ganz böses
Gesicht g'macht. `Schau, daß d' weiterkommst, du Lausbub´, hat's zu mir
g'sagt, `und wenn du dich verplauscht, reiß' ich dir dein Schädel
aber ...´« Ferdl machte ein ganz nachdenkliches Gesicht. Anna aber
meinte plötzlich: »Glaubst du nicht, daß er bei mir schon hineingeht?«
Ferdl sah sie an, sie hielt noch immer ihr Puppenkind an der bloßen
Brust, und er griff sie an, strich wie versuchend daran herum, und sie
entschied endlich: »Versuch's ein bißl ...« -- »Alsdann spielen wir
wieder Vater und Mutter«, schlug Anna vor. Franz ging gleich zu ihr, und
auch ich nahm jetzt, nach all den Belehrungen, die ich empfangen hatte,
und nach der Geschichte, die ich eben vernommen, diesen Vorschlag
bereitwillig an. Aber Anna wies Franz von sich. »Nein«, sagte sie,
»jetzt soll der Ferdl mein Mann sein, und du bist der Pepi ihrer.« Damit
rückte sie ihrem Bruder an die Seite, schob ihre Hand in seinen
Hosenspalt, und er griff ihr sogleich unter die Röcke. Ich packte Franz
und erinnere mich, daß ich das mit einer starken Aufregung tat. Als ich
seine kleine bloße Nudel aus der Hose nahm, und die Vorhaut auf- und
niederschob, spielte er mit seinen Fingern an meinem Loch, und da wir
jetzt beide wußten, wie's gemacht wird, lagen wir in der nächsten
Sekunde auf dem Boden, und ich regierte mit der Hand seinen Zapfen so
genau, daß er mir nicht den Bauch hinauffuhr, sondern mich genau in
meiner Spaltung bestreichelte. Dies machte mir ein Vergnügen, von dem
ich im ganzen Körper eine wohlige Spannung verspürte, so daß auch ich
mich gegen ihn rieb und wetzte, wann ich nur konnte. Das dauerte eine
Weile, bis Franz erschöpft auf mich fallend niedersank und sich nicht
rührte. Wir lagen ein paar Momente so, dann hörten wir einen Disput
zwischen Ferdl und Anna, und schauten nach, was sie machten. Sie lagen
noch immer aufeinander, aber Anna hielt ihre beiden Beine so hoch, daß
sie über Ferdls Rücken sich berührten. »Er geht schon hinein ...« sagte
Ferdl, aber Anna meinte: »Ja, hinein geht er, aber weh tut's -- laß
gehn, es tut weh.« Ferdl beruhigte sie: »Das macht nix, -- das ist im
Anfang -- wart nur, vielleicht geht er ganz hinein.« Wir legten uns
flach auf den Boden, rechts und links von den beiden, um festzustellen,
ob Ferdl drin sei oder nicht. Er war wirklich ein wenig drin. Der untere
Teil von Annas Fummel war breit geöffnet, wie wir mit Staunen
wahrnahmen, und da drinnen steckte Ferdls Schwanz bis über den Kopf und
fuhr unbeholfen hin und her. Wie Ferdl eine heftige Bewegung machte,
glitt er ganz hinaus, aber ich ergriff ihn sofort und fügte ihn wieder
in Annas Eingang, der mir schon ganz rotgerieben vorkam. Ich hielt ihn
fest, und versuchte ihn tiefer hineinzudrängen. Ferdl selbst stieß in
der Richtung, die ich ihm gab, kräftig nach, aber Anna fing auf einmal
laut zu schreien an, so daß wir erschrocken auseinanderfuhren. Sie
weigerte sich, das Spiel fortzusetzen, und ich mußte Ferdl noch einmal
auf mich nehmen, weil er sich nicht beruhigen wollte. Nun war aber auch
ich einigermaßen rot gerieben, und weil es inzwischen schon Zeit wurde,
gingen wir heim. Mein Bruder und ich sprachen auf dem Weg in unsere
Wohnung kein Wort. Wir wohnten auch im letzten Stockwerk dieses Hauses,
Tür an Tür mit der Frau Reinthaler. Als wir oben auf dem Gang ankamen,
sahen wir die kleine dicke Frau im Gespräch mit einer anderen Nachbarin
stehen. Wir gafften sie an und begannen laut zu lachen. Als sie sich
nach uns umdrehen wollte, flüchteten wir in unsere Tür.
Seit jenem Tage betrachtete ich Kinder und Erwachsene, Männer und Frauen
mit völlig veränderten Blicken. Ich war erst sieben Jahre alt, aber
meine Geschlechtlichkeit kam voll zum Ausbruch. Sie muß in meinen Augen
zu lesen gewesen sein, mein ganzes Gesicht, mein Mund, mein Gang muß
eine einzige Aufforderung gewesen sein, mich anzupacken und
hinzuschmeißen. Nur so kann ich mir die Wirkung erklären, die damals
schon von mir ausging, die ich in der Folge übte, und die es zustande
brachte, daß fremde und wie mir scheint, besonnene Männer gleich bei der
ersten Begegnung mit mir alle Vorsicht außer Acht ließen und
unbedenklich alles wagten. Diese Wirkung kann ich auch jetzt noch
bemerken, wo ich weder jung bin noch schön und wo mein Körper welk
geworden und die Spuren meines Wandels greifbar zu erkennen gibt.
Trotzdem gibt es noch Männer, die auf den ersten Blick von mir in
Flammen geraten und sich dann in meinem Schoß wie die Rasenden gebärden.
Diese Wirkung mag schon viel früher tätig gewesen sein, als ich noch
wahrhaft unschuldig war, und vielleicht ist sie es gewesen, die den
Schlossergesellen dazu trieb, die Scham der Fünfjährigen zu entblößen.
Ein paar Tage später waren wir Kinder allein zu Hause, und da begann der
Franz den Lorenz zu fragen, ob er denn wisse, woher die Kinder kommen
und wie sie gemacht werden. Lorenz meinte: »Weißt du's vielleicht?«
Franz und ich lachten, und ich holte Franzens kleinen Stift aus dem
Hosentürl, streichelte ihn ein wenig, während Lorenz mit ernster Miene
zusah, wie Franz mich an meiner Spalte kitzelte. Dann legten wir uns
aufs Bett und spielten unser Stückchen, das wir von Anna und Ferdl
gelernt hatten, mit allem Talent herunter. Lorenz sprach kein Wort, auch
nicht, als wir fertig waren, aber als ich mich ihm näherte, und die Hand
in seine Hose stecken wollte, indem ich ihm sagte: »Komm, jetzt mußt
du's auch probieren ...« stieß er mich weg und zu unserem großen
Erstaunen erzählte er: »Das Vögeln kenn' ich schon längst. Glaubt's ihr
vielleicht, ich werd' auf euch warten? Aber das darf man nicht. Das ist
eine schwere Sünd', Unkeuschheit ist das, und wer vögelt, kommt in die
Höll'.« Wir erschraken nicht wenig, aber dann bestritten wir die
Behauptung. »Glaubst du am End'«, fragten wir ihn, »daß der Vater und
die Mutter auch in die Höll' kommen?« Er war fest überzeugt davon, und
gerade deshalb gaben wir alle Angst auf und verhöhnten ihn. Lorenz aber
drohte, er werde uns beim Vater, beim Lehrer und beim Katecheten
verklagen, und seitdem haben wir unsere kleinen Vergnügungen niemals
wieder in seiner Gegenwart vorgenommen. Er wußte trotzdem, daß Franz und
ich fortfuhren, aufeinander zu liegen, oder uns mit anderen Kindern
abzugeben; aber er schwieg und wich uns aus.
Wir waren sehr oft bei Anna und Ferdl und spielten immer dasselbe. Immer
wurde ich zuerst vom Ferdl, Anna von Franz gevögelt, dann die Anna von
ihrem Bruder und ich von dem meinigen. Trafen wir die beiden einmal
nicht daheim, oder mußten wir selbst zu Hause bleiben, dann vögelten wir
eben allein. Aber es verging kein Tag, an dem wir nicht aufeinander
lagen. Unsere gemeinsamen Gespräche aber drehten sich nur um den
einzigen Wunsch, es einmal mit einem Großen tun zu dürfen. Anna und ich
wünschten sich einen wirklichen, erwachsenen Mann, Ferdl und Franz
wünschten sich die Frau Reinthaler.
Einmal als wir wieder zu Anna kamen, war Besuch da. Eine dreizehnjährige
Kousine von ihr, Mizzi und ihr Bruder Poldl. Die Mizzi war ein hübsches,
schon recht entwickeltes Mädchen, und ihre jungen Brüste standen fest
und frei unter ihrer dünnen Bluse. Es wurde natürlich gleich von dem
gesprochen, was uns am meisten interessierte, und Poldl rühmte sich, daß
seine Schwester schon Haare auf der Fut hätte. Er hob ihr ganz ruhig die
Kleider auf, und wir sahen respektvoll auf das dreieckige, dunkle
Büschel, das sich dort befand, wo wir noch nackt waren. Dann wurden die
Brüste der Mizzi entblößt und von uns allen bestaunt und gestreichelt.
Mizzi geriet in Aufregung. Sie schloß die Augen, lehnte sich zurück und
streckte die Hände nach Franz und nach ihrem Bruder aus. Jeder gab ihr,
was er in der Hose trug, zu halten, und Ferdl stellte sich zwischen ihre
Beine und spielte mit seinem Schwanz an ihrem Spalt. Endlich sprang sie
auf, eilte zum Bett, warf sich darauf und rief: »Poldl, komm her, ich
halt's nimmer aus.« Ihr Bruder schwang sich zu ihr hinauf. Wir waren
alle um das Bett getreten und sahen zu. Während Ferdl seinen Schweif der
atemlos daliegenden Mizzi zu halten gab, vertraute Franz den seinigen
Annas Händen an; ich aber schaute voll Interesse zu, wie einmal
»wirklich gevögelt« wird. Denn Mizzi und ihr Bruder, der erst zwölf
Jahre alt war, erklärten uns, daß sie es genauso machen könnten wie die
Großen. Ich sah mit Verwunderung, wie Poldl seine Schwester auf den Mund
küßte. Denn ich hatte bisher nicht gedacht, daß das Küssen mit
dazugehört. Ich sah auch, wie Poldl Mizzis beide Brüste in der Hand
hielt, während er auf ihr lag, sie fortwährend streichelte und ich
bemerkte, wie die Brustwarzen spitz und hoch herausstanden. Ich sah, wie
Poldls Schweif gänzlich in dem schwarzen Haarbüschel seiner Schwester
verschwand, und griff selbst hin, um mich zu überzeugen, ob er wirklich
in ihrem Leib steckte. Und ich war plötzlich furchtbar erregt, als ich
mit eigenen Händen fühlte, wie Poldls Stange, die übrigens viel größer
war als die von Franz und Ferdl, tief in Mizzis Leib hineinfuhr, bis ans
Ende, wieder herauskam, und wieder darin versank. Am meisten aber setzte
mich Mizzis Gehaben in Verwunderung. Sie warf sich mit ihrem Popo ihrem
Bruder entgegen, vollführte hitzige Stöße, zappelte mit den Füßen in der
Luft, war ganz atemlos und seufzte immerfort, so daß ich glaubte, es
müsse ihr doch furchtbar weh tun. Ich merkte aber dann, daß es anders
war, als sie keuchend ein ums andere Mal ausrief: »Fester! Fester! Noch
fester, so, so, gut, gut, gut, aah!« Kaum hatte Poldl seinen Schwanz
herausgezogen und stieg vom Bett herab, als Ferdl und Franz sich
herandrängten. Mizzi war mit gespreizten Beinen liegen geblieben, mit
nackten Schenkeln und mit nackten Brüsten. Lächelnd sah sie zu, wie
Ferdl und Franz sich stießen, wer sie zuerst haben sollte, und eben als
die beiden Miene machten, miteinander ernstlich zu raufen, entschied sie
den Streit, indem sie nach meinem Bruder griff und erklärte: »Zuerst der
Kleine da!« Franz warf sich auf Mizzi. Aber er fing an, sie in der Art
zu reiben, wie er es an mir und Anna gewöhnt war. Mizzi hielt seine
Bewegung auf, erwischte ihn am Zipfel und schob ihn mit einem Ruck in
die Spalte. Franz war ganz verblüfft, hörte auf, sich zu rühren, und tat
so, als wollte er mit seinem Schwanz erst fühlen, wo er sich befand.
Aber Mizzi duldete diese Ruhe nicht. Sie begann sich unter ihm zu
werfen, fing ihre Gegenstöße an, und gleich war Franz wieder
herausgerutscht ohne hineinzufinden. Jetzt half ich ihm aber, ich hielt
meine Hand hin und brachte ihn, wenn er ausgleiten wollte, jedesmal auf
den rechten Weg. Eine neue Schwierigkeit ergab sich, weil Mizzi durchaus
wollte, Franz solle mit ihren Brüsten spielen. Aber wenn er sie in die
Hand nahm und sie zu kitzeln und zu streicheln begann, vergaß er ganz
das Vögeln, und wenn ihn Mizzi dann wieder zum Vögeln trieb, vergaß er
ihre Brüste. Er konnte beides zugleich nicht bewältigen, und Mizzi
beklagte sich schweratmend: »Schad is, der kann noch gar nix!« Ferdl,
der ungeduldig dabeistand, bemächtigte sich jetzt der Duteln Mizzis,
drückte sie, küßte sie auf die Warzen, daß sie wieder hoch aufgerichtet
wurden, und nahm damit Franz die eine Hälfte seiner Aufgabe ab. Franz
kam in ein regelmäßiges schnelles Stoßen, was Mizzi sehr recht war. Sie
seufzte und jammerte und schnalzte mit den Lippen, und warf sich hoch im
Bett in die Höhe und sagte dabei zu uns: »Ah, das ist gut, das ist gut,
der kleine Schwanz ist gut.«
Kaum waren sie fertig, als sich Ferdl mit gezücktem Speer, ohne dabei
Mizzis Brüste loszulassen, seitlich aufs Bett und zwischen Mizzis Beine
schwang, die ihn begierig aufnahm. Auch dem Ferdl half ich die rechte
Öffnung finden, und unterhielt mich, meine Finger an seinem Hodensack zu
halten, wodurch ich jedesmal genau fühlte, wenn der Schwanz bis zum Rest
in Mizzi eindrang. Ferdl verkündigte gleich das erstemal, als er
hineingeglitscht war, mit Sachkenntnis: »Ganz so wie bei der Frau
Reinthaler.« Und er zeigte sich so gewandt und geschickt im Bohren,
Stoßen und Wetzen, daß das Bett unter den Beinen krachte und Mizzi laut
zu schnaufen begann. Wie nun die beiden fertig waren, wollten Anna und
ich auch unsern Teil haben. Mizzi hatte sich vom Bett erhoben, war eilig
heruntergesprungen, lachend, frisch, als wäre gar nichts geschehen. Und
doch hatte sie dreimal hintereinander die verschiedenen Schwänze in sich
gehabt, und hatte eine Remmelei ausgehalten, die, wie ich glaube,
beinahe eine Stunde gedauert haben muß. Sie brachte ihre Kleider unten
ein wenig in Ordnung, ließ aber ihre Brüste frei und meinte, jetzt wolle
sie zuschauen. Anna warf sich gleich aufs Bett und rief den Poldl, der
sie überhaupt sehr zu interessieren schien. Aber Poldl hatte wieder mit
den Brüsten seiner Schwester zu tun. Er hob sie mit den Fäusten in die
Höhe, preßte sie fest zusammen und nahm ihre Warzen in den Mund. Mizzi
lehnte an einem Schrank, ließ sich diese Liebkosungen mit Behagen
gefallen und bearbeitete dafür ihres Bruders Schweif mit ihren Händen.
Anna lag vergebens auf dem Bett in Bereitschaft; denn Poldl hob nach ein
paar Minuten seiner Schwester die Röcke auf, und mit ihrer Beihilfe
brachte er seine Rute wieder in ihr unter. Stehend vögelten die beiden
mit einer Heftigkeit, daß der Kasten pumperte. Wir hatten noch nicht
gewußt, daß man die Sache auch so betreiben könne, und schauten diese
neue Kunst mit Verwunderung an. Es war beinahe selbstverständlich, daß
dann wieder Franz an die Reihe kam. Er machte es diesmal besser, denn er
klammerte sich im Stehen an die Brüste von Mizzi, während sie seinen
Schwanz nicht losließ und dafür sorgte, daß er nicht aus dem Geleise
kam, und zuletzt vögelte auch Ferdl in dieser neuen Stellung Mizzi, die
jetzt die sechste Nummer sehr vergnügt aushielt und nicht die Spur einer
Erschöpfung zeigte.
Dafür waren Anna und ich ganz enttäuscht. Anna machte sich wieder an
Poldl heran, und versicherte ihm, daß man auch bei ihr hineinkäme, und
nicht auswendig zu wetzen brauche. Er hob ihr die Röcke auf, bohrte ein
wenig mit dem Finger in ihrer Fotze herum, und meinte, es ginge noch
nicht. Anna aber wollte ihn nicht loslassen. Sie hielt seinen Schweif in
der Hand, und arbeitete daran herum, denn er hing ganz matt und weich
herunter. Ich hatte mich zu Ferdl gewendet, fand aber keine Geneigtheit
bei ihm vor. Er erlaubte mir nur gnädig mit seinem Schweif zu spielen,
was ich auch tat. Währenddessen betastete er nun meine Brust, die noch
ganz flach war, und meinte bedauernd: »Du hast halt keine Duteln.« Ich
mußte es aufgeben, von ihm gevögelt zu werden, und probierte nun Franz
zu kriegen. Mit dem war aber nichts zu machen, weil er wieder auf Mizzi
lag. Er vögelte sie gerade nicht, spielte aber mit ihrer Brust, und als
ich ihm an die Hose griff, und sein Gezeug wieder stand, forderte er
mich auf, ihm wieder zu Mizzi hineinzuhelfen. Das mochte ich nicht, doch
er fand den Weg ohne mich, und am Boden liegend, machte Mizzi die
siebente Partie, die wohl die ausgiebigste war, weil sie mehr als eine
halbe Stunde dauerte.
An diesem Tage waren Anna und ich sehr enttäuscht, und ich ging betrübt
nach Hause, diese elende Mizzi, mit ihren Brüsten und ihren Haaren
verwünschend. Dafür wurde aber dann in den nächsten Wochen alles wieder
eingeholt. Mizzi und ihr Bruder wohnten weit weg und konnten nur selten
auf Besuch kommen. Und in der Zwischenzeit genügten Anna und ich unsern
beiden Partnern. Das Spiel »Vater und Mutter« wurde ganz ausgesetzt, wir
spielten jetzt nicht mehr, sondern vögelten ganz ohne Vorwand, genau so
wie Mizzi und Poldl. Wir vögelten stehend und liegend, und hatten, Anna
ebenso wie ich oft sogar Schmerzen zu leiden, weil Ferdl und Franz jetzt
durchaus immer probieren wollten, ob es nicht doch möglich sei, uns ihre
Schwänze einzupfropfen. Es ging aber nicht.
Dieses Leben dauerte den ganzen Sommer. Dann zogen unsere Freunde in
eine andere Gegend, und ich sah die blonde Anna erst viel später wieder.
Vorher aber war Mizzi mit ihrem Bruder noch einmal da, und mit ihnen war
ein großer Bursch gekommen, der schon fünfzehn Jahre alt war. Er hieß
Robert, war schon in der Lehre, und er übernahm sogleich den Oberbefehl
über unsere Spielerei. Als er uns seinen Schwanz zeigte, bemerkten wir,
daß er schon Haare hatte, und wir drei Mädchen spielten lange mit ihm.
Wir streichelten ihn, liebkosten seine Eier, hielten seine Stange, die
sich ganz heiß anfühlte, in unseren Händen und freuten uns, wenn wir sie
leise zucken fühlten. Wir waren ganz entzückt von ihm, denn er hatte
einen großen, vollen Schweif, wie wir noch keinen gesehen. Mizzi
forderte ihn auf, mit ihr den Anfang zu machen. Er sagte: »Nein. Ich
will zuerst die Pepi vögeln.« Und ich erinnere mich, wie groß meine
Freude war. Ich lief sofort zum Bett, legte mich rücklings darauf und
indem ich mich aufdeckte, spreizte ich die Beine, um ihn zu empfangen.
Robert kam ans Bett, griff mich bei meiner nackten Fut an, und sagte:
»Uj jegerl, da kann man nur von außen wetzen.« Mizzi rief eifrig
dazwischen: »Aber natürlich, und nicht einmal Haar hat sie noch darauf,
geh vögel mich, bei mir kannst du ihn ganz hineinstecken, weißt schon.«
Und schon lag sie auch neben mir im Bett und wollte mich verdrängen.
Aber Robert antwortete: »Das gibt's net, ich will die Pepi vögeln.« Ich
lag ganz still und schaute ihn an, und er war sehr rot im Gesicht und
rieb mir fortwährend seinen Finger in die Spalte, so daß ich geil wurde
wie noch nie. Er überlegte einen Augenblick, dann erklärte er: »Ich
werd' euch was zeigen.« Nun rief er Anna, die sich auch ins Bett, aber
an die Wand legen mußte. Ich lag in der Mitte, Mizzi am äußersten Rand.
Robert stieg ins Bett, legte sich aber nicht auf mich, sondern befahl
mir: »Dreh dich um.« Ich lag nun auf dem Bauch, und er schob mir die
Kleider in die Höhe, so daß mein Popo entblößt war. Anna mußte höher
gegen das Kopfende des Bettes kriechen, so daß sich ihre Fut neben
meiner Schulter befand. Er deckte sie auch auf. Und von Mizzi verlangte
er, daß sie ihre Brüste entblöße. Sie ließ ihr Hemd herab, und ich sah,
daß ihre Brustwarzen wieder spitz hervorgetreten waren. Jetzt nahm
Robert mich unter dem Bauch, daß mein Popo ein bißchen in die Höhe kam.
Er hieß mich, die Schenkel fest zusammenpressen und schob mir seinen
Schweif von hinten nach vorne, so daß ich die heiße Nudel an den
Hinterbacken am Damme und außen zwischen meiner Spalte spürte und so
zwischen Schenkeln, Damm und Popo hielt ich ihn ganz eingeschlossen.
Robert zog die Hand unter meinem Bauch hervor und begann leise zu
stoßen. Ich verspürte eine solche Annehmlichkeit, daß es mir durch alle
Glieder fuhr. Plötzlich begann ich wie Mizzi zu stöhnen und zu seufzen
und erwiderte seine Stöße mit meinem Popo. Den Kopf hatte ich im Bett so
vergraben, daß ich nichts sah, sondern nur empfand, wie Robert mich
vögelte. Zu meinem Erstaunen aber hörte ich auch Anna und Mizzi seufzen
und ächzen. Ich schaute auf und sah, wie Robert mit der linken Hand ganz
an der Fut von Anna spielte, und er muß es sehr gut getan haben, denn
sie warf sich hin und her. Mit der rechten Hand spielte Robert auf einer
Brustwarze von Mizzi, die immer höher und spitzer wurde. Dabei vögelte
er mich in langsamen Stößen und atmete schwer. Ferdl und Franz standen
neben dem Bett und schauten zu. Mizzi schrie am lautesten: »Ah, ah, --
ich will was in die Fut, ah, Franzl, Ferdl, steckt's mir ihn einer
hinein, -- ah, ich muß vögeln. -- kleiner Franzl komm ...« Sie tastete
mit der einen Hand herum, und Franz beeilte sich, ihr seinen Schwanz zu
geben. Sie riß ihn zu sich, und Franz lag nun neben Robert auf dem Bett
und vögelte Mizzi nach Noten. Dabei hatte er wieder die Annehmlichkeit,
daß Robert ihm die Pflicht abnahm, mit den Brüsten Mizzis zu spielen.
Denn Robert ließ nicht nach. Mizzi war so geil, daß sie wieder ihre Hand
ausstreckte und diesmal gab ihr ihr Bruder Poldl seinen Schwanz zu
halten. Sie fuhr daran herum, Poldl war auch ganz aufgeregt, und auf
einmal hatte sie den Schwanz zwischen ihren Lippen in den Mund genommen
und begann daran zu saugen. Ferdl, der leer ausgegangen war, hielt es
nicht mehr aus. Über den Kopf von Mizzi weg kroch er in das Bett zu
seiner Schwester Anna, nahm ihren Kopf und stieß ihr seinen Schwanz in
den Mund. Sie ließ sich's nicht nur ruhig gefallen, es schien sie sogar
nur noch mehr aufzureizen, und ich schaute ihr zu, wie sie an dem
Zapfen, der in ihren Mund ein- und ausfuhr, leckte und schmatzte. So
waren wir hier alle sieben auf einmal beschäftigt. Robert fuhr fort mich
langsam zu vögeln, und mir war es, als habe ich noch nie etwas gefühlt,
das so gut war wie dieser dicke, heiße Schweif. Auf einmal wurde Roberts
Schweifstoß heftiger und rascher, und plötzlich spürte ich mit
Schrecken, daß ich mit etwas Nassem, Heißem am Bauch übergossen wurde.
Ich schrie auf. Aber Robert fuhr mich, emsig wetzend an: »Sei stad, mir
kommt's jetzt.« Ich wehrte mich und wollte weg: »Du tust mich ja
anbrunzen.« Er sagte: »Nein, ich tu' spritzen -- das muß sein.« Danach
war er fertig. Wir lösten uns alle voneinander, und alle waren über die
Neuigkeit, daß Robert gespritzt hatte, ganz erstaunt. Robert versicherte
uns, daß Ferdl, Franz und Poldl noch zu klein seien und daß deshalb nur
ein kleines Tröpferl erscheine, wenn's ihnen kommt. Bis sie Haare auf
dem Schwanz kriegen, würden sie auch so viel spritzen wie er.
Mizzi wollte wissen: »Wirst du mich jetzt vögeln?« Aber die Buben, Anna
und ich verlangten Robert spritzen zu sehen. Robert war dazu bereit.
»Ihr müßt's mir's halt mit der Hand machen«, meinte er. Aber wir kannten
das nicht. So zeigte er uns, wie man die Sache anfängt, indem er sich in
einen Sessel setzte und sich einen abzuwichsen begann. Das begriffen wir
bald und wetteiferten darin, Robert einen herunterzureißen. Abwechselnd
bearbeiteten Anna, Mizzi und ich sein steif dastehendes Glied, und Mizzi
begann es in den Mund zu nehmen und daran zu saugen. Sie tat es mit
solcher Begierde, daß der lange Spargel beinahe gänzlich in ihrem Mund
verschwand. Wir beiden anderen sahen ihr zu, und Anna wollte sie
ablösen. Aber Robert ergriff mich bei den Haaren, stieß Mizzi zur Seite
und drängte meinen Mund gegen seinen Schweif. Nun war ich daran. Ich
hatte nicht viel Zeit zu überlegen, spitzte die Lippen und empfing
dieses Ding, das ich schon von einer andern Stelle meines Leibes her
kannte. Aber kaum spürte ich, wie er in meinen Mund eindrang, als ich
von einer ungeahnten Geilheit ergriffen wurde. Jedes Hin und Her und
jedes Aus und Ein verspürte ich in meiner noch verschlossenen Fut und
wie ich so auf- und abfuhr an Roberts Schweif, hatte ich auf einmal eine
Ahnung, wie das wirkliche Vögeln sein müsse. Nach mir kam Anna an die
Reihe. Aber kaum hatte sie ein wenig geleckt, als Robert zu spritzen
begann. Sie fuhr zurück und spuckte die erste Ladung, die sie erhalten
hatte, aus. Robert erfaßte seinen Schwanz und riß sich den kalten Bauer
bis zu Ende herunter, und wir drängten uns alle um ihn, um das
Schauspiel zu sehen. Ruckweise wurde die weiße, dicke Masse in großen
Tropfen emporgeschleudert, so hoch, daß ich einen ganzen Patzen davon
ins Gesicht bekam. Wir waren alle voll Bewunderung und furchtbar
aufgeregt.
Mizzi fiel gleich wieder über Robert her und bat ihn: »Aber jetzt, jetzt
wirst du mich vögeln, willst du!« Doch Roberts Schweif war schlapp
geworden und hing wie ermüdet herab. »Es geht nicht«, meinte Robert, »er
steht mir nimmer.« Mizzi war außer sich. Sie setzte sich zwischen
Roberts Knie auf den Fußboden, nahm seinen Schwanz und saugte daran,
schob sich ihn ganz in den Mund, schmatzte und leckte und rief
dazwischen zu Robert aufsehend: »Aber wenn er wieder steht, dann vögelst
du mich, was?«
Unterdessen wollten die anderen, Franz, Poldl und Ferdinand, das
neuentdeckte Mundvögeln auch erproben. Anna und ich mußten herhalten,
und es ging ganz leicht, denn ihre Schwänze waren alle noch klein und
viel dünner als der von Robert. Ich nahm Annas Bruder, Ferdl, Anna nahm
Franz. Ferdl war so rasend, daß er mir seinen Schweif bis in die Kehle
stieß. Ich mußte ihn an der Wurzel halten und fuhr nun selbst sanfter
hin und her. Nach zehn-, zwölfmalen kam es ihm. Ich fühlte das Zucken,
spürte aber nichts Nasses, weil ja nur ein Tropfen kam. Mir aber war es,
als hätte ich den Schwanz tief in meiner Fut gehabt, und ich spürte,
daß auch mir etwas kommen müsse. Ich hielt Ferdls Schweif im Mund, bis
er ganz weich geworden war. Und weil die Anna immer noch den Franz
schleckte, nahm ich gleich den Poldl, der schon wartete. Poldl hatte
diese Sache mit seiner Schwester erfunden. Er war sehr geschickt, und
ich konnte mich ruhig verhalten, indessen er so geschickt aus- und
einfuhr, als sei er in einer Fut. Mich befiel ein Jucken, ein Krampf,
eine Wonne, die ich nicht beschreiben möcht, ohne zu wissen was ich tat,
spielte ich mit meiner Zunge an dem Schweif, der mir im Mund war, was
nur bewirkte, daß es Poldl sofort kam. Er hielt mich am Genick fest auf
seinen Schweif gedrückt, und das Klopfen seiner Adern erhöhte mein
Lustgefühl. Auch ihn behielt ich, bis er ganz weich war.
Dann schauten wir uns nach Anna und Franz um. Mizzi lag noch immer vor
Robert am Boden und sog an seiner weichen Nudel. Anna aber hörte auf
einmal zu schlecken auf und sagte: »Probiern wir's, vielleicht geht er
doch hinein.« Franz warf sich an sie und wir eilten hin, um zuzuschauen.
Sei es nun, daß der Schweif von Franz so klein war oder daß er durch den
Speichel, der auf ihm haftete, besser glitschte oder daß die vielen
Bohrversuche, die Anna und ihr Bruder vorgenommen hatten, schon den Weg
geebnet haben mochten, genug es ging. »Er ist drin«, rief Anna und
jubelte. »Drin is er«, rief Franz, und ich erkundigte mich bei Anna, ob
es weh tue. Aber ich bekam keine Antwort. Denn die zwei vögelten mit
einer Vehemenz, daß ihnen Hören und Sehen verging. Erst nachher sagte
mir Anna, das sei doch das Beste gewesen.
Mittlerweile hatte Mizzi Erfolg gehabt. Sie hatte Roberts Zipfel so
lange gereizt und gewuzelt, bis er sich wieder aufrichtete und Robert
bereit war, sie endlich zu vögeln. Franz und Anna konnten nicht schnell
genug Platz machen. Und Mizzi war wie eine Verrückte. Sie hielt sich
selbst bei den Brüsten. Sie nahm einen Finger Roberts nach dem andern,
und steckte sich ihn in den Mund, sie fuhr mit der Hand herunter,
erwischte Roberts Schweif, drückte ihn zärtlich und stieß sich ihn dann
wieder tief hinein. Sie schleuderte sich unter ihm, daß das Bett
krachte. Auf einmal ließ Robert seinen Kopf sinken, ergriff eine Brust
von Mizzi und begann an ihrer Warze zu lecken und sie in den Mund zu
stecken, genau so wie wir's mit seinem Schweif getan hatten. Mizzi
weinte und jammerte vor Geilheit: »Vögel mich, vögel mich«, jammerte
sie, »alle Tag mußt du mich vögeln ..., das ist ein Schwanz, ein guter
Schwanz ist das ..., fester stoßen ..., noch fester, noch, noch ... nimm
die andere Dutel auch ..., die andere Dutel auch zuzeln, fester,
schneller, ah, ah ... noch fester ... und du wirst morgen wieder
vögeln? ... Du? Morgen ... komm morgen nachmittag ..., alle Tag mußt du
mich vögeln ..., Jesus, Maria und Josef ... ah ... ah!« Robert stieß ein
kurzes Grunzen aus und spritzte ... Mizzi lag wie tot da.
Es war kein Zweifel. Robert war die Hauptperson. Anna freute sich, daß
sie nun endlich wie eine Große gevögelt habe. Allein an diesem Tag
achtete niemand von uns darauf. Und Robert erzählte uns, daß er schon
seit zwei Jahren vögele. Seine Stiefmutter hat ihn dazu abgerichtet.
Sein Vater war gelähmt und schlief im Zimmer mit der Mutter. Robert
schlief in der Küche allein. Eines Abends, als er in der Küche war, der
Vater war noch wach, kam die Mutter heraus. Und wie es langsam dunkel
wurde, rückte sie ganz nah zu Robert heran. Sie saßen auf der
Küchenbank nebeneinander. Und da fing sie an ihn zu streicheln. Zuerst
am Kopf. Dann die Hände. Dann die Schenkel und endlich schlüpfte sie mit
ihrer Hand in seine Hose. Sein Schweif wurde gleich hart und stellte
sich auf, kaum daß die Mutter ihn berührte. Sie spielte eine Weile mit
ihm, und er griff ihr, rasend in seiner Aufregung, an die Brust. Da ließ
sie ihn los, um selbst das Kleid aufzuknöpfeln, und sie ließ ihn mit
ihrem nackten Busen spielen, führte ihn selbst zu den Brustwarzen und
zeigte ihm, wie er es machen solle. Und sie atmete dabei so laut, daß
der Vater aus dem Zimmer herausrief, was denn los sei. Die Mutter
antwortete schnell: »Nichts, nichts, ich bin nur beim Robertl da.« Dabei
hielt sie Robert wieder am Schwanz und streichelte ihn. In der Nacht
aber, als der Vater schlief, kam sie zu ihm im Hemd heraus, stieg zu
Robert ins Küchenbett, setzte sich rittlings auf und steckte sich seinen
kleinen Schwanz hinein. Robert lag auf dem Rücken und rührte sich nicht.
Aber wie die Duteln seiner Mutter so über seinem Gesicht hingen, griff
er wieder danach und spielte mit ihren Brustwarzen, und sie beugte sich
tiefer nieder, damit er bald die eine, bald die andere ihrer beiden
Brüste in den Mund nehmen könne. Und da ward ihm sehr wohl dabei, und er
vögelte seine Stiefmutter, bis es ihr kam, und sie schwer auf ihn
niedersank.
Am nächsten Abend saß er wieder mit ihr in der Küche, und sie spielten
wieder miteinander wie gestern; und in der Nacht, wenn der Vater
eingeschlafen war, kam sie wieder zu ihm heraus und ließ sich von ihm
vögeln. Einmal aber kam sie nicht, obwohl er vorher in der Küche mit ihr
gespielt hatte. Er konnte nicht einschlafen und saß im Bett aufrecht
und konnte, weil der Mond ins Zimmer schien, auf die beiden Betten
hinschauen, in denen seine Eltern lagen. Und da sah er, wie die Mutter
rittlings auf dem Vater saß. Sie war ganz nackt und hob sich auf und
nieder, und beugte sich herab und schob ihre Brüste dem Mann, der sich
nicht rühren konnte, abwechselnd in den Mund. Robert wartete bis sie
fertig waren, dann rief er nach der Mutter, als sei ihm schlecht. Sie
kam zu ihm heraus und erkannte gleich, daß er durch die dünnen Vorhänge
der Türfenster im Mondlicht alles beobachtet haben müsse. »Hast was
g'sehn?« fragte sie ihn. Robert antwortete »Ja, -- alles.« Sie gab ihm
sofort ihre Brüste zum Spielen und legte sich zu ihm ins Bett. »Diesmal
sollst du oben liegen«, versprach sie. Robert hatte das noch nie getan.
Sie zeigte ihm, wie er es machen solle, und sie zog ihr Hemd aus, so daß
sie ganz nackt vor ihm lag. Robert vögelte sie mit aller Kraft, denn er
war furchtbar geil. Aber kaum hatte er seinen Schwanz hinausgesteckt,
als der Vater aus dem Zimmer herausschrie: »Was will denn der Robert?«
Die Mutter drückte ihn fester in sich hinein und rief zurück: »Mich will
er.« Der Vater wollte wissen: »Was will er denn?« Und vögelnd antwortete
dann die Mutter: »Ach nichts, jetzt ist ihm schon besser.« Bald darauf
schlief der Vater ein, und die zwei arbeiteten weiter. Robert erzählte,
daß sie ein paarmal aufhören mußten, weil das Bett so laut krachte. Als
er dann fertig war, wollte seine Mutter es noch einmal haben, und weil
ihm seine Nudel nicht gleich stand, nahm sie sie in den Mund und suzelte
daran, so lange, bis Robert beinahe laut aufgeschrien hätte vor Wonne.
Und dann mußte er aus dem Bett, mußte sich auf den Küchensessel
niedersetzen, und seine Mutter saß so fest auf ihm, daß sie ihn beinahe
erdrückt hätte. Zuletzt zog sie ihr Hemd wieder an und ging zu ihrem
Manne hinein. Robert aber mußte den nächsten Tag im Bett bleiben, so
schwach war er von dieser Nacht. Da sah der Vater, daß ihm wirklich
schlecht gewesen sei. Jetzt vögelte Robert seine Stiefmutter seit zwei
Jahren beinahe alle Tage. Wir hatten einen großen Respekt vor ihm, als
er uns die Geschichte erzählte, und wir waren wieder alle bereit zu
vögeln, denn an der ganzen Sache hatte uns das oben Liegen am meisten
interessiert. Robert aber meinte, es gäbe noch andere Arten. Er habe
seine Stiefmutter auch schon von hinten gevögelt, und ich bemerkte, das
sei sehr angenehm, ich hätte es ja von ihm auch so gekriegt. Anna und
Mizzi wollten das oben Liegen probieren. Anna nahm sich Franz, weil
seine Nudel die einzige war, die zu ihr hinein paßte, und Mizzi mußte
mit ihrem Bruder Poldl die Sache versuchen. Ich wollte es auch haben,
jedoch stand er dem Robert und dem Ferdl nicht, und so begann ich den
Ferdl wieder zu schlecken, bis er mich auf sich legen ließ und mir die
Spalte wetzte, daß es mir kam. Robert allein schloß sich der allgemeinen
Geselligkeit nicht mehr an, weil er, wie er sagte, sich doch noch etwas
für seine Mutter aufheben müsse, die ja sicherlich am Abend wieder zu
ihm kommen werde.
Kurze Zeit darauf zogen Anna und Ferdl mit ihrem Vater in eine andere
Wohnung. Ich war jetzt mit Franz allein. Wir vögelten nimmer, weil wir
in unserer Wohnung wegen des Lorenz und wegen der Mutter nicht so
ungeniert waren. Ich schlief, wie schon gesagt, im Zimmer meiner Eltern
und verlegte mich nun darauf, sie zu belauschen. Oft genug hörte ich die
Betten krachen, hörte den Vater schnaufen und die Mutter seufzen,
konnte aber im Finstern nichts ausnehmen. Jedesmal geriet ich aber in
eine heftige Aufregung und begann mit dem Finger an meiner Muschel zu
spielen, bis ich endlich die Fertigkeit erreicht hatte, mich selbst, so
gut es ging, zu befriedigen. Oft hörte ich auch leise Gespräche. Eines
Abends, an einem Samstag, kam der Vater nach Hause, während wir schon
schliefen. Ich wachte auf und bemerkte, daß er angetrunken war. Im
Zimmer brannte ein Licht. Die Mutter war aufgestanden und half ihm beim
Auskleiden. Wie er nun im Hemd war, haschte er nach ihrer Brust, sie
wehrte ihn ab, doch er packte sie und flüsterte: »Geh her, Alte, gib die
Füß' auseinand.« Meine Mutter wollte nicht: »Gib an Ruh', du bist
b'soffen.« -- »Wann ich auch b'soffen bin, das macht nix ...« -- »Nein,
ich mag nit.« -- »Ah, was!« Mein Vater war ein starker Mann mit einem
großen Schnurrbart und wilden Augen. Ich sah, wie er die Mutter ergriff,
ihr das Hemd abriß, sie bei beiden Brüsten packte und aufs Bett warf, so
daß er gleich auf ihr lag. Meine Mutter spreizte quer über dem Bett die
Beine und wehrte sich nicht mehr. Sie sagte nur: »Lösch das Licht doch
aus!« Der Vater fuhr auf ihr herum und herrschte sie an: »Steck'n doch
hinein! Sakra!« Die Mutter wiederholte: »Erst lösch das Licht aus, wenn
eins von die Kinder aufwacht ...« Er brummte: »Ah was, die schlafen ganz
gut«, und blieb auf ihr liegen und gleich darauf begannen seine Stöße
und ich hörte die Mutter sagen: »Ah, das ist gut, hörst, was du heut für
einen großen Tremmel hast, ah, langsamer, schön langsam hin und her und
ganz tief hinein, ganz tief ..., jetzt schneller, schneller ...,
schneller ... und jetzt spritz, spritz, was d'kannst!! Aaaah!« Mein
Vater stieß ein tiefes Brummen aus, dann waren sie beide still. Nach
einer Weile löschten sie das Licht aus und bald hörte ich sie alle zwei
schnarchen. Ich schlüpfte aus dem Bett, schlich zum Ledersofa, auf dem
Franz schlief. Er war wach, hatte von seinem Platz aus nichts sehen
können, aber alles gehört. Sofort war er auf mir. Ich drehte mich aber
um, legte mich auf den Bauch, wie ich's von Robert gelernt hatte und
ließ mir's von rückwärts machen. Wir verfuhren sehr leise, und niemand
hörte uns. Ich bemerkte aber dabei, daß es des Nachts und nackt, wie wir
alle beide waren, viel besser sei. Und nun vögelten wir ein wenig öfter,
weil wir es nachts wagen konnten, wenn wir sicher waren, daß alles
schlief.
Etliche Monate nach unserer Trennung von Anna und ihrem Bruder zog ein
neuer Bettgeher zu uns. Das ist der andere, von dem ich erzählen muß. Er
war schon ein älterer Mann, so zirka fünfzig Jahre alt, was er
eigentlich für eine Beschäftigung hatte, weiß ich nicht. Er war viel zu
Hause, saß in der Küche und plauderte mit der Mutter, und wenn alle
weggegangen waren, blieb ich oft mit ihm allein. Weil er einen großen
Vollbart hatte, beschäftigte ich mich oft mit dem Gedanken, wie viel
Haare er wohl zwischen seinen Füßen haben mochte. Aber als ich ihm
einmal an einem Sonntag zusah, wie er sich in der Küche wusch und zu
meinem nicht geringen Staunen entnahm, wie seine ganze Brust mit Haaren
bedeckt war, fürchtete ich mich einigermaßen vor ihm, ohne daß jedoch
meine Neugierde sich verminderte.
Er war gleich von Anfang sehr freundlich zu mir, streichelte mich an den
Haaren, faßte mich unterm Kinn, und ich drückte mich schmeichelnd an
ihn, wenn ich ihn begrüßte. Wie wir nun wieder einmal allein waren,
wurde ich sehr geil, denn es fiel mir ein, daß man jetzt alles in Ruhe
machen könne. Ich ging zu Herrn Ekhard -- so hieß er -- in die Küche,
ließ mich wieder von ihm streicheln und fuhr ihm mit den Händen in den
Bart, was mich noch mehr in Aufregung brachte. Und wieder muß etwas in
meinem Blick gewesen sein, etwas, was ihm die Besinnung raubte. Er
klopfte mir plötzlich mit dem Handrücken auf mein Kleid, gerade an die
kritische Stelle. Ich stand vor ihm, er saß auf einem Sessel, und so
klopfte er da unten bei mir an. Es konnte ganz zufällig sein. Hätte ich
nichts geahnt, wäre es mir gar nicht aufgefallen. So aber lächelte ich
ihn an, und mein Lächeln mochte wohl alles gesagt haben. Denn jetzt
griff er schon ein wenig fester zu, aber immer noch über meinem Kleid.
Ich trat zwischen seine geöffneten Knie näher an ihn heran, wehrte ihn
nicht ab, sondern lächelte nur weiter. Da wurde er auf einmal ganz rot
im Gesicht, riß mich an sich heran, küßte mich stürmisch, hob mir dabei
meinen Rock auf und spielte mit seinen Fingern an meiner Spalte. Aber
das war ein ganz anderes Spielen, als ich es bisher gekannt hatte. Ich
wußte gar nicht, ob er mit einem Finger oder mit allen fünfen spielte,
mir war gleich als ob ich gevögelt würde, als dränge er tief in mich
ein, obwohl er's gar nicht tat und ich begann langsam zu wetzen, während
ich an seiner Brust lehnte. Er faßte mich bei der Hand und führte mich,
und gleich darauf hielt ich seinen Schweif. Der war so riesengroß, daß
ich ihn gar nicht umspannen konnte. Ich fuhr sofort an dieser großen
glühenden Stange auf und ab, und er spielte mit mir und küßte mich. So
rieben wir uns gegenseitig eine Weile, bis er zu spritzen anfing. Ich
fühlte, wie meine Hand ganz warm überrieselt wurde und hörte die
schweren Tropfen auf dem Fußboden aufklatschen, und dabei kam es auch
mir, denn während er spritzte, hatte er die Geschwindigkeit seiner
Finger verzehnfacht.
Wie alles vorüber war, saß er ganz erschrocken da, drückte mich in seine
Arme und flüsterte mir zu: »Wirst du's niemandem sagen?« Ich schüttelte
den Kopf. Da küßte er mich, stand auf und ging fort. Ein paar Tage lang
sah ich ihn nur flüchtig. Er wich meinem Blick aus und schien sich vor
mir zu schämen. Das berührte mich ganz sonderbar, so daß ich immer
davonlief, wenn er kam. Nach einer Woche aber, während ich einmal mit
meinen Brüdern im Hof unten umherlief, -- die Mutter war nicht zu Hause
-- sah ich ihn kommen und die Stiege hinaufgehen. Eine Weile nachher
schlich ich hinterdrein. Das Herz klopfte mir, als ich die Küche betrat.
Er griff rasend nach mir, gierig, und seine Hände zitterten, wie ich gut
bemerkte. Ich warf mich in seine Arme und hatte sofort wieder den Genuß,
von seinen Fingern bedient zu werden. Wir saßen nebeneinander, und er
gab mir seinen Schweif. Heute konnte ich mir ihn genau betrachten. Er
war doppelt so lang und doppelt so dick wie der von Robert, und er war
ganz gebogen. Jetzt, wo ich manches Tausend dieser Liebesinstrumente in
meinen Händen wie auch sonst in allen Löchern meines Leibes gehabt habe,
kann ich nachträglich feststellen, daß es ein ausnehmend schönes und
rüstiges Exemplar von einem Schweif gewesen ist, der mich noch ganz
anders ergötzt hätte, wäre ich nur damals um paar Jahre älter gewesen.
Ich wichste ihm ganz feurig einen herunter, und so gut ich's von Robert
gelernt hatte. Wenn ich aber inne hielt, sowie ich ermüdete, oder wenn
ich tiefer rutschte, um den weichen Haarbuschen, der aus seiner Hose
hervorquoll, näher zu betasten, flüsterte er mir zu: »Weiter, mein
Engerl, mein Mauserl, mein süßes Schatzerl, meine kleine Geliebte, ich
bitt' dich um Gottes willen, weiter, weiter ...« Ich war über diese
Namen, die er mir gab, ganz paff, bildete mir ungeheuer viel darauf ein
und arbeitete, um es ihm recht zu machen, so fleißig weiter, daß sein
Samen bald hoch aufspritzte und mich beinahe ins Gesicht getroffen
hätte, weil ich dicht über seinen Schwanz gebeugt war.
Ein paar Tage später, als wir wieder im Begriffe waren, uns gegenseitig
einen herunterzureißen, sagte er mir wieder: »Schatzerl, Engerl,
Mauserl, Herzerl, Geliebte«, und auf einmal, ich streichelte seinen
Schweif gerade besonders gut, und dabei warf ich meinen Popo hin und
her, denn er bearbeitete meine Fut, daß es mir jeden Augenblick kommen
wollte, da flüsterte er mir zu: »Ach Gott, wenn ich dich nur vögeln
könnte ...« Mit einem Ruck hatte ich mich von seiner Hand befreit, ließ
ihn los und warf mich zur Erde, breitete die Füße auseinander und lag in
Erwartung da. Er kam zu mir, beugte sich herab und keuchte: »Aber das
geht ja nicht, du bist ja noch zu klein ...« -- »Das macht nichts, Herr
Ekhard«, sagte ich ihm, »kommen Sie nur.« Er legt sich, halbtoll vor
Geilheit, auf mich, schob mir seine Hand unter den Popo, so daß er mich
aufheben konnte und rieb nun mit seinem Schwanz an meiner Fut. Ich hielt
ihn dabei am Schweif fest, und sorgte dafür, daß er meine ganze Spalte
bestrich. Er stieß, so rasch er konnte, und fragte dabei: »Hast du denn
schon einmal gevögelt?« Ich hätte ihm gerne alles erzählt, von Franz und
Ferdl und von Robert, aber ich weiß nicht was mich dazu trieb, nein zu
sagen. Er fuhr fort: »Geh Engerl, sag mir, du hast schon gevögelt, ich
merk' es ja, -- sag mir nur mit wem? Oft? War's gut?« Ich arbeitete mit
meinem Popo und atmete schon schwer, denn er lag auf meiner Brust, und
ich fühlte auch schon, wie sein Schweif schon zu zucken begann. Aber ich
log ganz frech weiter: »Nein, g'wiß nicht ... heut zum erstenmal ...« --
»Ist's gut ...?« fragte er weiter. -- »Ja, sehr gut ...« In diesem
Augenblick floß er über und benetzte mir den Bauch, so daß mir die Suppe
an den Leisten herunterrann. »Bleib so liegen«, meinte er und sprang
auf, zog sein Taschentuch und trocknete mich sauber ab.
Dann forschte er mich weiter aus: »Das gibt's nicht«, sagte er, »daß du
noch von gar nichts weißt, das erzähl mir nicht. Das kenn' ich schon.«
Und als ich weiter leugnete, meinte er: »Wahrscheinlich hast du aber
einmal zug'schaut, was?« Das schien mir ein Ausweg. Ich nickte
zustimmend. »Wo denn?« drang er weiter in mich. Ich deutete ins Zimmer.
»Ach ja, dem Vater und der Mutter?« -- »Ja.« -- Jetzt wollte er mehr
wissen: »Wie haben sie's denn gemacht?« Und er gab nicht nach, bis ich
ihm alles erzählte. Und während ich sprach, hatte er mir wieder die
Röcke aufgehoben und spielte wieder an meiner Fut, so daß es mir noch
einmal kam.
Ich hatte es nun auch mit einem »Großen« gemacht, worüber ich nicht
wenig stolz war. Aber ich schwieg doch Franz gegenüber, und wenn wir
manchmal bei unseren Nachmittagsunterhaltungen davon sprachen, wie es
erst mit »Großen« sein müsse, ließ ich mir nichts merken und brachte das
Gespräch immer auf die Frau Reinthaler, weil Franz sich alle Mühe gab,
dieser Frau vor die Augen zu gehen, und davon träumte, ihr auch einmal
Wäsche auf den Boden tragen zu helfen.
Seit ich von Herrn Ekhard gevögelt worden war, sah ich mich nach
erwachsenen Männern noch mehr um, malte es mir von jedem aus, wie er
mich auf die Knie nehmen würde und freute mich, mit ganz andern Augen
nach ihnen zu blicken. Es kam auf der Straße oft vor, daß Männer, die
ich angeschaut hatte, sich erstaunt nach mir umdrehten. Manche blieben
sogar stehen, und einer winkte mir, aber ich getraute mich nicht ihm zu
folgen, obwohl ich dann plötzlich geil wurde. Aber seit mir dieser eine
zugewinkt hatte, lief ich Nachmittags oft auf das Fürstenfeld, weil es
dort einsamer war und ich dort viel eher einen zweiten Herrn Ekhard zu
treffen hoffte. Einmal war ich länger und auch weiter umherspaziert, und
es dämmerte bereits stark, als ich mich auf den Rückweg machte. Langsam
kam mir ein Soldat entgegen, und als er ganz nahe war, schaute ich ihm
lächelnd ins Gesicht. Er blickte mich betroffen an, ging aber weiter.
Ich spähte rasch umher und sah, daß weit und breit niemand war. Dann
drehte ich mich um. Der Soldat war stehengeblieben und schaute mir nach.
Ich lächelte ihm zu und ging weiter. Nach einer Weile drehte ich mich
wieder um, und jetzt winkte er. Mein Herz klopfte, meine Fut brannte,
meine Neugierde war aufs Höchste erregt. Trotzdem hielt ich mich aus
Angst zurück, und blieb nur stehen. Jetzt kam der Soldat ganz eilig zu
mir heran. Ich rührte mich nicht. Er beugte sich zu mir nieder und stieß
mit ernstem Gesicht heraus: »Bist allein ...?« -- Ich nickte mit dem
Kopf. »Alsdann komm«, flüsterte er und schritt querfeldein auf ein
Gebüsch zu. Ich trottete hinter ihm her, zitternd vor Angst, doch
folgte ich ihm Schritt vor Schritt, ich konnte nicht anders. Kaum waren
wir hinter das Gebüsch getreten, als er mich ohne ein weiteres Wort zu
Boden warf und auch schon auf mir lag. Ich spürte seinen Schweif gegen
meine Fut stoßen und griff mit der Hand dazwischen. Er aber drängte mich
fort und probierte nun seinerseits mit der Hand nachhelfend, ob er mir
nicht seine Nudel hineinstecken könne. Mir taten diese Versuche sehr
weh, aber ich muckte nicht. So wechselte die Sache ab. Einmal fuhr er
mir so über meine Spalte hin, und das war mir angenehm, dann suchte er
wieder den Eingang und preßte dagegen an, und das verursachte mir
Schmerzen. Zuletzt wurde er ganz wild und wollte mit Gewalt
hineinkommen. Er lenkte sein Geschoß mit der einen Hand, mit der anderen
spreizte er meine Fut. Ich spürte seine Schwanzspitze schon in meinem
Loch sitzen, er bohrte, bohrte und bohrte, und ich glaubte, er werde
mich auseinandersprengen. Schon wollte ich aufschreien, so heftig
schmerzte mich die Sache, da spritzte er und überschwemmte mich mit
seinem Samen. Gleich darauf sprang er auf, ließ mich liegen und ging
davon, ohne mich auch nur anzusehen. Als ich dann wieder hervorkam und
den Wiesenweg erreichte, sah ich ihn in der Ferne stehen und sein Wasser
lassen. Es dunkelte schon, und ich wollte eilig nach Hause. Kaum aber
war ich hundert Schritte gegangen, klopfte mir jemand auf die Schulter.
Erschrocken fuhr ich zusammen. Vor mir stand ein zerlumpter Junge, etwas
kleiner als ich, vielleicht auch etwas jünger. »Du, was hast denn mit
dem Soldaten getan?« fragte er mich. »Nichts«, schrie ich ihn zornig an.
»So -- nichts --?« lachte er höhnisch. »Ich hab's ganz gut g'sehn, was
du getan hast.« Ich bekam Angst. »Nichts hast du g'sehn, du Lausbub«,
fuhr ich ihn an, aber schon weinerlich, »meiner Seel', ich hab' nichts
getan.« Er fuhr mir mit der Hand zwischen die Beine: »Du Luder, du! Ich
hab's g'sehn, g'vögelt hast im Gras dort, verstehst ...?« Er stand
zornig da und puffte mich immerfort in die Fut. »Was willst denn von
mir?« fragte ich ihn bittend, denn ich sah wohl ein, daß ich ihm das
Gesehene nicht ableugnen durfte. »Was ich will?« Er trat ganz dicht zu
mir. »Auch vögeln will ich, verstehst?« Jetzt gab ich ihm einen Stoß vor
die Brust: »Schau, daß d' weiterkommst.« Aber plötzlich schlug er mir
eine Ohrfeige ins Gesicht, daß es nur so klatschte. »Ich werd' dir
geben, stoßen«, rief er. »Mit ein' Soldaten möchtest vögeln und mich
tätst stoßen, was? Na wart nur, ich geh' dir bis z' Haus nach und sag's
deiner Mutter ... Ich kenn' dich schon.« Mit einem Satz trat ich zur
Seite und rannte davon. Aber er holte mich ein, erwischte mich bei der
Schulter und wollte mich wieder schlagen. »Komm vögeln«, sagte ich jetzt
rasch. Ich gab es auf, ihm zu entrinnen. Wir traten hinter das Gebüsch,
legten uns ins Gras und er schob mir die Kleider in die Höhe. Dann legte
er sich auf mich und sagte: »Den ganzen Nachmittag wart ich schon auf
ein Mädel zum Vögeln.« Er mochte sieben Jahre alt sein. »Wie hast mich
denn g'sehn?« fragte ich. »Ich bin ja im Gras g'legen, wie der Soldat zu
dir herkommen ist, und dann bin ich euch nachgeschlichen.« Er hatte
einen ganz kleinen spitzigen Schwanz, der mich nicht schlecht vögelte,
so daß es mir auf einmal ganz recht war, ihm nachgegeben zu haben und
ich nicht begriff, warum ich mich geweigert hatte, ihn vögeln zu lassen.
Sein Zipfel war so klein und dünn, wie ich noch keinen gespürt hatte und
mir kam die Idee, daß diesem Buben da gelingen könnte, was der Soldat
bei mir vergebens versucht hatte, nämlich zu mir hineinzukommen. Ich
erwischte ihn deshalb mit der Hand und führte ihn, und offenbar weil ich
schon von dem dicken Schweif des Soldaten ein wenig angebohrt war, dann
auch weil noch von seinem Samen alles ganz naß und glitschrig in mir
war, rutschte er gleich ein ganzes Stück herein. Ich wetzte nun und
stemmte mich dagegen, und er kam wirklich beinahe vollständig in meine
Fut. Es tat mir doch ein wenig weh, aber dem Buben gefiel die Sache,
denn er remmelte wie ein Uhrwerk so rasch, und ich war viel zu stolz,
jetzt endlich wie eine wirkliche Frau gevögelt zu werden, als daß ich
das nicht ausgehalten hätte. Es dauerte eine ganze Weile bis der Bub
fertig war. Er lief gleich davon, und ich ging endlich nach Hause. Der
Vater war mit der Mutter im Gasthaus, der Herr Ekhard lag in der Küche
im Bett, meine Brüder schliefen schon. Ich wollte bei Ekhard vorbei,
aber er rief mich leise an, so daß ich an sein Bett trat. Er zog meine
Hand unter die Decke und ich tastete nach seiner Nudel. Sie stand nach
wenigem Streicheln voll und steif in die Höhe, und da er stets unter der
Decke nackt war, konnte ich seinen Hodensack, seine Schenkeln, kurz
alles genau befühlen. Ich wollte aber nicht, daß er mich anrühren solle,
denn ich war noch ganz naß. Er aber flüsterte mir zu: »Willst du nicht
vögeln?« -- »Nein«, sagte ich, »heute nicht«, ich wichste nun drauf los,
damit es ihm eher kommen solle. Er versuchte mit seiner Hand unter meine
Kleider zu geraten, ich entzog mich ihm. »Was ist denn?« fragte er. »Die
Buben könnten's hören ...«, antwortete ich. Aber von dem Wichsen und von
dem Gefühl, das sein heißer großer Schwanz in meiner Hand erregte, war
ich wieder geil geworden, und ich dachte an nichts weiter mehr, als er
mich kraftvoll aufhob und mich auf seinen Schwanz setzte. Ich raffte nur
geschwind die Kleider in die Höhe und rieb mich an dieser heißen und
dicken Stange. Herr Ekhard merkte gar nicht, daß ich naß war. »Mein
Engerl«, sagte er, »mein Schatzerl«, und gerade als es mir so heftig
kam, daß ich am ganzen Körper zuckte, spritzte er auch, und es war so
reichlich, daß ich die Nässe noch die ganze Nacht auf dem Hemd spürte.
Es war ein ereignisreicher Tag für mich gewesen, fast so wie jener, an
dem uns Robert das richtige Vögeln und Schlecken beigebracht hatte.
Franz spürte noch immer der Frau Reinthaler nach, und auch ich
beobachtete sie, wo ich nur konnte, um alles meinem Bruder erzählen zu
können. Ich sah sie oft beim Haustor mit allerlei Männern reden und
scherzen und glaubte jedesmal, daß diese Männer sie vögelten. Besonders
oft bemerkte ich sie mit dem Herrn Horak, und die Folge zeigte, daß ich
wenigstens in diesem einen Falle recht vermutet hatte. Herr Horak war
ein Bierversilberer, der alle Tage mit einem großen Bierwagen vor das
Haus gefahren kam und da Fässer abladen und aufladen ließ. Im Keller
unseres Hauses war nämlich ein Bierdepot. Herr Horak war ein großer
starker Mann, etwa dreißig Jahre alt, ein athletischer Kerl mit einem
roten, feisten Gesicht, einem kleinen blonden Schnurrbart und einem
glattgeschnittenen Schädel. Er hatte auch ein goldenes Ohrringel, was
mir besonders an ihm gefiel. Mir schien damals überhaupt, als ob Herr
Horak ein schöner und prächtiger Mann sei. Er trug immer einen weißen
Piket-Janker oder einen grauen Sommeranzug, und immer hatte er eine
schwere silberne Uhrkette, an der ein schweres silbernes Pferd baumelte,
was meine besondere Bewunderung erregte. Als ich einmal aus der Schule
nach Hause kam, stand die Frau Reinthaler mit dem Herrn Horak beim Tor.
Sie hatte eine rote Bluse an, die nicht in ihrem Rock befestigt war,
sondern vorne ganz lose herunterhing. Geschnürt war sie auch nicht, und
ich sah wie ihre starken Brüste voll hervorstanden, jede Brust einzeln
und seitwärts, und man konnte sogar die Brustwarzen durchsehen. Herr
Horak lehnte in seinem weißen Janker vor ihr, und sie lachten
miteinander. Eben als ich näherkam, haschte Herr Horak nach ihrer Brust,
und sie wehrte ihn ab, indem sie ihn auf die Hand schlug. Er rang ein
paar Sekunden mit ihr, fuhr ihr wieder nach der Brust und quetschte sie
ganz zusammen. Frau Reinthaler stieß ihn fort, und er bückte sich und
tat so, als ob er ihr unter die Röcke fahren wollte. Sie kreischte laut
auf, hielt sich die Hände vor, und schlug auch wieder nach ihm, aber sie
war gar nicht böse. Ich schlich unbemerkt um sie herum und beobachtete
sie. Denn dieses Treiben interessierte mich natürlich, und am liebsten
hätte ich mich dazugestellt und alles angehört, was sie sprachen. Herr
Horak aber unternahm keinen Angriff mehr, sondern hatte offenbar ein
ernstes Gespräch begonnen. Dann verschwand er im Haustor und gleich nach
ihm Frau Reinthaler. Ich huschte eilig nach und sah, wie die Frau
Reinthaler in den Keller ging. Eine Weile wartete ich, dann stieg ich
ganz leise die Kellertreppe hinunter. Ich kannte mich aus und gewann
eine Mauerecke, in der ich Posto faßte. Von da aus konnte ich in den
langen Gang blicken, der vor mir lag, und an dessen Ende der Kellerraum
war, der von einer Luke sein Licht empfing und die Bierfässer enthielt.
Frau Reinthaler und Herr Horak standen gerade in der Mitte und hielten
sich umarmt und küßten sich, und dabei hatte er ihr die Bluse
aufgehoben, ihr ins Hemd gegriffen und hielt jetzt ihren Busen in der
Hand. Es war eine volle, milchweiße runde Brust, auf der die großen
roten Hände des Herrn Horak jetzt herumdrückten und patschten. Die Frau
Reinthaler aber stand ganz an ihn geschmiegt, und während sie sich von
ihm küssen ließ, sah ich, wie sie ihm das Hosentürl aufknöpfte. Wie dann
aber sein Schwanz in ihre Hand kam, fing sie zu zittern an und lehnte
sich noch fester an ihn. Es war ein unglaublich langer, dünner Schweif
und auffallend weiß. Er war so lang, daß man die Hand der Frau
Reinthaler gar nicht bemerkte, so hoch schaute er drüber heraus, und sie
brauchte schon eine hübsche Weile, wenn sie ihn auf und nieder in seiner
ganzen Länge abreiben wollte. Aber daß er gar so dünn war, erstaunte
mich. Herr Horak, der so laut schnaufte, daß ich ihn bis zu mir hören
konnte, drängte nun die Frau gegen ein hohes Faß, nahm ihr noch die
zweite Brust aus dem Hemd und streichelte und preßte beide, und Frau
Reinthaler lehnte sich gegen die Wand, und ich hörte, wie sie leise
sagte: »Gehn S' kommen S' schon, ich halt's nicht mehr aus.« Ich war
neugierig, wie sie es machen werden, denn diese Stellung hatte ich noch
nicht gesehen. Herr Horak, dem sein langer dünner Schweif bis zum
baumelnden Silberpferd hinaufstand, nahm die Beine der Frau über seine
Arme, und so drückte er ihr ihn stehend hinein, während sie auf dem Faß
sitzen blieb und mit dem Rücken gegen die Wand lehnte. »Jesus, Maria und
Josef«, schrie die Reinthaler leise auf, als sie den Stachel zu fühlen
bekam. »Jesus, Maria, Sie stoßen mir ja den Magen ein ...« Horak
vögelte rasch und mit aller Kraft, und sein Kopf war gesenkt dabei, so
daß er die bloßen Brüste der Frau betrachtete. Es war, als ob er sie
durch und durch spalten wolle, so heftig fuhr er in sie hinein und
heraus, und sie küßte ihn bald auf das glattgeschorene Haar, bald preßte
sie seinen Kopf zwischen ihre Brüste, bald wieder redete sie zu ihm oder
keuchte auf vor Entzücken: »Ah ..., ah ..., das halt' ich nicht aus, ...
mir kommt's ja alle Augenblick ..., jetzt ..., jetzt ..., jetzt ..., so
-- jetzt ist mir's wieder 'kommen ..., ah, das ist gut ..., gehn S'
halten S' noch zurück ..., noch nicht spritzen ..., Jesus, Maria ...,
wenn mein Mann so vögeln könnt' ..., ah ..., das ist gut ..., so hat's
mir noch keiner gemacht ..., ah ..., das g'spür' ich bis in Mund
herauf ..., ah ..., wenn ich das g'wußt hätt', wie Sie's können, dann
hätt' ich's schon lang hergegeben ... Noch mehr ..., Herrgott ..., da
wär' man ja der reine Narr, wenn man so an Mann nicht drüberlasset ...,
ah es kommt mir schon wieder ..., fester ..., fester ..., so ist
gut ..., gehn S' Herr Horak ..., einmal müssen wir aber als nackender
vögeln ..., was ...? Als nackender ..., ja ...? Im Hotel ..., ja ...?«
Er gab keine Antwort, sondern stieß ihr nur immer seinen Schwanz in den
Leib, daß es ihr jedesmal einen Ruck gab. Sie begann zu schnappen, zu
keuchen, zu röcheln und stieß zuletzt ein leises Geheul aus, das wie ein
Weinen klang. Ihr Atem ging pfeifend, sie warf sich ganz zurück, so daß
jetzt ihr Popo in der Luft schwebte, über das Faß hervorragend. Er hielt
sie an den Hinterbacken fest und bohrte sich in sie ein, und keuchte nur
einmal: »Jetzt.« Damit rannte er ihr ihn noch einmal so tief in den
Leib, daß sie laut aufbrüllte vor Wonne. Dann rührte er sich nicht
mehr; und nach einer Weile zog er seinen Schweif langsam heraus und gab
sie frei. Frau Reinthaler richtete sich auf, ordnete ihr Haar, und dann
fiel sie dem Herrn Horak um den Hals und küßte ihn. »Hören S'«, sagte
sie, »so kann's aber wohl der zehnte nicht. Das hab' ich mein Lebtag
noch nicht g'sehn ...« Er zündete sich eine Zigarette an und fragte:
»Wie oft ist's dir denn gekommen?« -- »Ich weiß gar nicht«, meinte sie,
»fünfmal wenigstens.« Er nahm wieder ihre Brüste, wog sie in den Händen,
streichelte sie und zupfte an den Brustwarzen. Sie stand jetzt vor ihm.
»Wie oft kommt's dir denn, wenn dein Mann dich vögelt ...?« fragte er
lächelnd. Sie tat sehr entrüstet und verächtlich: »Gar nicht kommt's
mir. Mein Mann, der versteht's ja nicht. Wissen S', der kann's gar nicht
halten. Der legt sich drauf, steckt die Nudel hinein und spritzt gleich.
Das muß mich nur reizen. Ich bin immer so geil, wenn er mich gevögelt
hat, daß ich mir's dann mit der Hand machen muß.« Horak lachte laut und
fuhr fort, mit ihren Brüsten zu spielen. »Warum sagst ihm denn das
nicht ...?« -- »Ah, das nutzt nix. Wie oft streiten wir darüber. Er will
mir immer einreden, daß alle Männer so vögeln und daß es gar nix anderes
gibt. Er weiß ja nicht, daß ich mir manchmal an andern Schweif hol'.«
Horak lachte auf, und sie redete weiter: »Glauben S', oft schon hab' ich
mir denkt, es muß gehn mit ihm. Wenn er die zweite Nummer macht, braucht
er länger, und da kann ich mir's kommen lassen. Na, aber er will ihm ja
das zweitemal gar nicht stehen. Manchmal, wenn ich ihm dann fest
auseinand wuzeln und in' Mund nehmen tu ...«, sie hielt inne. »Ja, ja«
wiederholte sie dann, »zu so was bringt einen so ein Mann. Ich kann mir
nicht helfen. Nur damit er wieder steht, hab' ich ihn ein paarmal in
Mund g'nommen. Aber Schnecken. Wie er endlich wieder g'standen ist und
ich mir ihn g'schwind wieder hineingesteckt hab, pumps, gleich is er
losgegangen und ich hab' wieder die ganze Aufregung umsonst gehabt.«
Horak war aufgestanden: »Das mußt mir zeigen«, sagte er, »wie das is, in
den Mund vögeln. Das kenn' ich noch gar nicht.« Er hielt sie immer noch
an ihren vollen weißen Brüsten fest, die mir sehr gut gefielen.
»Aber nein, Herr Horak«, sagte sie, »das werden Sie schon sehr gut
kennen. Ihnen werden 's die Weiber doch oft genug getan haben. Sie
können doch eine jede haben, die was Sie wollen.«
Ich war in meinem Versteck ganz ihrer Meinung, denn ich hätte mir gerne
alles mögliche von Herrn Horak tun lassen, und hätte ihm auch gerne
alles getan.
»Nein«, sagte er, »ich hab' noch keine in den Mund gevögelt. Gehn S'
her, zeigen S' mir das.«
Er drückte sie wieder, ohne ihre Brust loszulassen, gegen das Faß. Sie
setzte sich, und er stand vor ihr.
»Aber bei Ihnen ist das doch nicht notwendig«, meinte sie. »Ihnen steht
er doch so auch.«
»Gar nicht steht er mir«, rief er, zog seinen Schweif heraus, der
wirklich ganz weich und lang herabhing.
Sie griff danach, nudelte ihn mit den Händen, und er zupfte sie wieder
an den Brustwarzen.
»Hören S', Sie regen mich ja wieder frisch auf«, meinte sie. »Ich hab'
keine Zeit mehr, ich muß gehen.«
Er preßte ihre Brust, daß das weiße Fleisch zwischen seinen roten
Fingern durchquoll. Plötzlich bückte sie sich, hob seinen Schwanz auf
und hatte ihn auch schon in den Mund gesteckt. Er ließ ihre Brust los
und keuchte. Jetzt war er es, der: »Maria und Josef« stöhnte.
In diesem Moment hörte ich wie jemand die Kellertreppe herabschritt.
Unwillkürlich rief ich ihnen zu: »Es kommt wer.«
Wie vom Schlag gerührt, schreckten sie zusammen und starrten auf mich.
Beide waren ganz bewegungslos. Sie mit ihren nackten Brüsten und er mit
seinem hochaufgebäumten Stachel. Er war der erste, der mit einem Ruck
den Schwanz in der Hose verschwinden ließ, die Knöpfe schloß und dann
eilig der Frau Reinthaler half, mit der Bluse ihre Brust zu verdecken.
Ich war ganz nah zu ihnen gegangen, schon weil auch ich Angst vor dem
unbekannten Jemand hatte, der in den Keller kam. Wir standen alle, ohne
ein Wort zu sagen, und die beiden starrten mich immer nur entsetzt und
beschämt an. Die Schritte näherten sich. Der Hausmeister kam vorüber,
sah uns drei da stehen, grüßte Herrn Horak, nahm einen Besen und stieg
die Treppe wieder hinauf.
Jetzt waren wir allein. Frau Reinthaler schlug die Hände vor die Augen
und tat, als ob sie sich vor mir, wer weiß wie, schämen würde, und Herr
Horak war im Ernst so verlegen, daß er zur Wand schaute und sich nicht
traute, das Gesicht nach mir hinzukehren. Wie nun die Frau Reinthaler
merkte, daß Horak nicht mit mir reden könne und daß ich Miene machte,
davonzugehen, stürzte sie auf mich zu und flüsterte nur ganz nahe bei
mir ins Ohr: »Hast d'was g'sehn?« wollte sie wissen. Ich gab ihr sofort
Bescheid: »Na -- das!« -- »Was ... das: Du hast gar nix g'sehn ...« Aber
ich widersprach ihr: »O ja ... ich hab' alles g'sehn, was Sie mit'n
Herrn Horak g'macht haben.« Während ich das sagte, bekam ich Angst vor
meiner Keckheit und wollte fort. Doch sie hielt mich an meinem
Handgelenk fest, und die beiden starrten einander ratlos an. Hierauf
griff Herr Horak in die Tasche, gab mir einen Silbergulden, und ohne
mich anzusehen, sagte er kleinlaut: »Da hast ... aber sag kein' Menschen
was ..., verstehst?« Ich war überglücklich, denn so was hatte ich nicht
erwartet, weil ich gefaßt darauf war, Prügel zu erhalten und mich doch
die ganze Zeit davor geängstigt hatte. Jetzt schwand meine Angst auf
einmal, weil ich erkannte, daß die beiden sich vor mir fürchteten. Ich
lachte auf, sagte zu Herrn Horak »Küß' die Hand« und wollte davon. Die
Reinthaler aber rief mich zurück. »Geh, wart noch ein bisserl«, sagte
sie freundlich. Ich blieb stehen, und sie eilte auf Horak zu, zog ihn
weiter von mir fort in eine Ecke und flüsterte aufgeregt mit ihm. Ich
sah beide aufmerksam an. Horak bekam ein ganz rotes Gesicht, schüttelte
den Kopf, aber sie brach ab, wandte sich zu mir und winkte mir: »Geh her
da, Kleine.« Als ich zu ihr kam, beugte sie sich zu mir, legte ihren Arm
um meinen Hals und schmeichelte: »Alsdann, sag mir jetzt, was hast denn
g'sehn ...?« Ich antwortete nicht, jedoch sie ließ nicht ab von mir:
»Sag's nur, wenn du's weißt ...« Ich schwieg; sie aber drang in mich:
»Siehst du ..., jetzt weißt du's gar nicht einmal, weil du halt nichts
g'sehn hast ...« Es entschlüpfte mir: »O ja ..., alles hab' ich g'sehn.«
-- »Na, so sag's doch, sag's doch ..., genier dich nicht vor Herrn
Horak ..., so red doch ..., wenn du's sagst ... schenkt dir der Herr
Horak was ..., oder er zeigt dir nachher was ..., na?«
Ich vermochte es aber doch nicht, vor dem Horak zu sprechen, sondern
drängte mich gegen die Brust der Frau Reinthaler und flüsterte ihr ins
Ohr: »Zuerst sind Sie auf dem Faßl da g'sessen ...«
»Na und ...?«
»... und der Herr Horak war zwischen Ihren Füßen ...«
Sie zog mich stärker an sich: »... und weiter ...?«
Ich faßte eine ihrer Brüste und deutete an, wie Horak damit gespielt
hatte ...
Sie aber hauchte weiter: »Na und was noch ...?«
Ich legte meine Lippen an ihr Ohr: »... und dann ham Sie das vom Herrn
Horak in' Mund g'nommen ...«
Sie wiegte mich in ihren Armen und fragte in singendem Ton, wie zu einem
kleinen Kind sprechend: »Na, und weißt du vielleicht ..., wie man das
heißt ...?«
Herr Horak war näher gekommen und stand vor uns. Ich lächelte ihn an und
sah, wie Frau Reinthaler ihm zublinzelte: »Weißt du, wie man das heißt
--?«
Ich wollte nun vor ihm zeigen, daß ich nicht so dumm sei und sagte ja.
Frau Reinthaler wiegte mich weiter und bat: »Na, so sag's, mein
Mauserl ..., geh ..., sag's doch ...«
Ich schmiegte mich an sie, weigerte mich aber und schüttelte den Kopf:
»Nein, ich sag's nicht ...«
Jetzt griff sie vor mir an das Hosentürl des Herrn Horak. Ich schaute
ihr gespannt zu, wie sie seinen Schweif herausnahm, der kerzengrad und
steif in die Höhe stand. »Sag's doch ..., sag's doch ...«
Sie streichelte den Schweif, setzte mich auf ihren Knien frei auf und
sagte: »Na so sag's doch, wenn du's weißt ...«
Wie ich aber weiter schwieg, nahm sie meine Hand und legte sie Herrn
Horak an die Nudel. Ich ließ mich willig führen, und wie ich jetzt
seinen langen Stachel anrührte, lächelte ich vergnügt und schaute dem
Horak in das rote Gesicht. Dann begann ich ihn leise, leise zu reiben,
hinauf und hinunter und sah, wie ihm die Knie zitterten. Frau Reinthaler
bog mit gelinder Kraft meinen Kopf der Schwanzspitze entgegen. Die
Eichel war ganz dicht vor meinem Mund und in meiner Hand fühlte ich, wie
heftig der Schweif des Horak pulsierte. Ich konnte nicht widerstehen,
öffnete die Lippen und ließ diese schöne weiße Nudel bis an meinen
Gaumen eindringen, fuhr langsam zurück und wieder vor und seufzte, wie
ich es bei Robert gelernt hatte. Ich fühlte die roten großen Hände
Horaks über mein Gesicht gleiten. Dann fuhr er abwärts und suchte, ob
ich nicht einen Busen habe. Wie er aber dort nichts fand, nahm er die
Brüste, die ihm Frau Reinthaler über meinem Kopf hin vorhielt. Sie
selbst fuhr mir von hinten unter die Röcke und fingerte mir an meiner
Spalte, so gut, daß mir Hören und Sehen verging und ich schneller und
schneller mir den Schwanz in den Mund stieß. Freilich nur das oberste
Stück, denn er war viel zu lang, als daß ich nur ein Viertel hätte
aufnehmen können.
Frau Reinthaler sagte, während sie in meiner Fut Klavier spielte,
keuchend zu Horak: »Nicht spritzen ..., ich möchte auch noch was haben.«
Da zog er mir seine Nudel aus dem Mund. Frau Reinthaler ließ mich von
ihrem Schoß herabgleiten und schon hatte sie ihn zwischen ihre Beine
genommen, während er tief in ihr Loch eindrang. Sie seufzte laut auf,
wandte ihren Kopf zu mir, die ich daneben stand und fragte jappend:
»Du ..., ah ah ..., weißt ..., wie ..., ah ah ..., wie man das
heißt ...?«
»Vögeln«, sagte ich.
Und von der Seite her griff mir jetzt Horak unter die Röcke. Ich kam
ihm entgegen, und während er die Frau Reinthaler bearbeitete, kniff und
drückte er mich mit seinen großen roten Händen an meiner Spalte, rieb
seine Finger einen nach dem anderen daran und suchte, ob mein Loch schon
offen sei. Ein bißchen drang er auch auf dem Weg vor, den der Bub hinter
dem Gebüsch damals gebahnt hatte. Ich hielt ihn mit meiner Hand fest und
ließ mich von seinem Zeigefinger vögeln, und die Beine zitterten mir vor
Wonne, denn das Seufzen, Keuchen und Sprechen der Frau Reinthaler, ihre
nackten Brüste, die an den roten Warzen ganz feucht schimmerten, das
schwere Schnaufen von Horak, regten mich noch mehr auf, als ich es von
dem langen Zuschauen ohnehin schon war.
Als wir dann fertig waren, sagte Horak, während er sich die Hose
zuknöpfte: »Das Mädel ist aber schon wie eine Ausg'lernte ...«
Frau Reinthaler lächelte mich an und meinte: »Natürlich, ich hab's
sowieso gleich erkannt. Ein kleines Menscherl ist sie.«
Und zu mir gewendet fragte sie: »Wie oft hast denn du schon
g'vögelt ...?«
Ich leugnete natürlich: »Gar nicht ... aber meiner Seel' gar nicht ...«
»Geh weiter.« Sie glaubte mir nicht. »Das darfst nicht sagen. Wie oft
hast du's 'tan? Aber lüg nicht.«
Doch ich blieb dabei: »Gar nicht ..., nur zug'schaut hab' ich manchmal
zu Haus, in der Nacht ...« Die Geschichte, die ich schon Ekhard erzählt
hatte, kam mir auch hier zustatten.
Wir gingen zusammen die Treppen hinauf, Frau Reinthaler und ich. Herr
Horak war noch im Keller geblieben. Sie kam mir jetzt wie eine Freundin
und Kollegin vor, und ich war nicht wenig stolz auf sie und auf mich.
Das war doch noch was anderes, als die Anna und die Mizzi. Mir fiel der
Ferdl ein und daß er die Frau Reinthaler am Boden oben gevögelt hatte.
Ferdl hatte auch mich so oft gevögelt und das war wieder ein
Zusammenhang zwischen mir und ihr. Ich hielt es nicht mehr aus zu
schweigen. Schmeichelnd hing ich mich in sie ein, während wir die
Treppen hinaufstiegen und sagte: »Frau Reinthaler ..., das ist ja nicht
wahr gewesen, was ich früher g'sagt hab' ...«
»Was meinst du denn?« fragte sie.
»Na, daß ich's noch nicht getan hab' ...«
Sie antwortete mir mit lautem Interesse: »Also hast du's schon getan?«
»Ja.«
»Das hab ich mir gleich gedacht. Oft?«
»Ja.«
»Wie oft denn?«
»Vielleicht zehnmal oder noch öfter ...«
»Mit wem denn?«
Jetzt spielte ich meinen Trumpf aus: »Mit dem Ferdl.«
Sie sagte gleichgültig: »Mit was für einem Ferdl?«
»Na mit dem großen Buben«, erklärte ich ihr, »der da im Haus g'wohnt
hat, der Anna ihr Bruder. Sie hab'n ihn ja gekannt.«
»Ich?« Sie stellte sich erstaunt. »Ich hab' ihn nicht gekannt ...«
Das enttäuschte mich freilich, und ich bestand darauf: »Aber ja, Sie
haben ihn gewiß gekannt ...«
Sie sah mich von der Seite her an: »Ich kann mich nicht erinnern ...«
Jetzt sagte ich's: »Wissen S' nicht mehr? Er hat Ihnen einmal geholfen,
Wäsch' am Boden tragen ...«
Sie fuhr merklich zusammen. Dann sagte sie: »So? Mir scheint ja ..., ich
weiß jetzt schon ...«
Ich ließ nicht los, drückte ihren Arm und flüsterte: »Frau Reinthaler,
der Ferdl hat mir was g'sagt ...«
Sie unterbrach mich: »Halt's Maul«, und damit war die Sache beendigt.
Ein paar Tage später traf ich den Herrn Horak, wie er eben in den Keller
ging. Ich grüßte ihn laut »Küss' die Hand«, um seine Aufmerksamkeit zu
erregen. Er drehte sich in der Kellertüre um, erblickte mich, kam zurück
und spähte weiter, ob niemand da sei. Als er sich dessen vergewissert
hatte, rief er mich: »Komm mit in' Keller ..., magst?« Ich war gleich
dabei. Im Keller unten blieb er im finsteren Gang stehen, faßte mich
beim Kopf und drückte mich gegen seine Hose. Ich ergriff seinen Schweif
mit beiden Händen und rieb ihn ab, und er sagte: »Ah, du kannst es aber
so viel gut ..., was ist denn das?« Ich gab keine Antwort, sondern
beeiferte mich, das Lob, das er mir spendete, zu verdienen; ich wurde
erfinderisch. Ich fuhr in seine Hose und streichelte seine Eier, und ich
zog mit der andern Hand seine Vorhaut über die Eichel und wieder zurück.
»Nimm's in' Mund«, bat er mich leise. Ich wollte nicht; warum weiß ich
selbst nicht, aber ich glaube, ich hätte seine lange Stange lieber
anders wohin genommen.
»Ich geb' dir einen Gulden«, versprach er, »wenn du ihn wieder in' Mund
nimmst.«
Aber ich schlug sein Anerbieten aus: »Machen S' mir's so wie der Frau
Reinthaler«, schlug ich ihm vor.
»Was? Ich soll dich vögeln?«
»Ja.«
»Aber. Kinderl, da bist du ja noch zu klein dazu.« Er war ganz erstaunt.
Ich hielt ihn am Schweif fest, wichste dann herum und rieb meine Fut an
seinem Knie. »O nein«, bestritt ich, »ich bin nicht zu klein. Sie können
mich schon vögeln.«
»Aber du hast ja noch gar keine Haare drauf«, meinte er wieder.
»Das macht nichts.« Ich wollte von ihm gevögelt sein, und ich gab nicht
nach.
»Ja, hast du's vielleicht schon einmal getan?«
»Na und wie oft schon ...«
Er riß mich zu sich empor, so daß ich rittlings auf seiner Hüfte saß,
Brust an Brust mit ihm, wie man kleine Kinder trägt. Mit der einen Hand
hielt er mich, und ich schlang die Arme um seinen Hals. Mit der andern
Hand wühlte er meine Kleider zurück, spreizte mit den Fingern meine
Spalte, und ich fühlte, wie er mit der Spitze seines Schwanzes an meinem
Eingang bohrte. Ich tanzte mit dem Popo auf und nieder, um ihn besser zu
spüren und ihn tiefer hinein zu bekommen.
Er hielt sein Gesicht gegen das meinige, stieß unten, was er konnte,
aber nach einer Weile sagte er doch: »Nein, nein, das geht nicht. Wart,
vielleicht ist's so besser ...« Er stellte mich auf den Boden, und ich
sah, wie rotgerieben sein Schwanz war. Er setzte sich auf ein niederes
Faß, rollte ein noch kleineres dicht heran, dann drehte er mich um, so
daß ich mit dem Rücken zu ihm stand. Nun glaubte ich, er werde mich so
traktieren, wie Robert es damals im Bett getan hatte und freute mich
darauf.
»Bück dich!« befahl er mir, ich tat es und lag nun mit den Ellbogen auf
das kleine Faß gestützt. Mein Popo stand in die Höhe. Wie ich mich
umschaute, bemerkte ich, daß Herr Horak seinen Schwanz mit Speichel
befeuchtete. Er sagte: »Das ist nur, damit's leichter geht ...«
Dann entblößte er meinen Hintern und aufstehend beugte er sich über
mich, daß er genau in meiner Stellung über mir war. Voll Staunen, Angst
und Entsetzen nahm ich wahr, daß er seinen Schweif an meinen After
ansetzte und langsam zu bohren anfing. Ich wollte schreien, aber er
flüsterte mir zu: »Sei stad und wenn's dir weh tut, dann sag's.« Damit
griff er aber auch nach vorn zwischen meine Beine und begann, während er
sich mit dem Schwanz in mein Popoloch vorsichtig einwühlte, mit den
Fingern an meiner Fut vortrefflich zu spielen.
»Tut's weh?« fragte er.
Es tat mir schon ein bißchen weh, zugleich aber taten mir seine Finger
wohl, und so sagte ich: »Nein.«
Er bohrte mit einem kleinen Ruck tiefer: »Tut's weh?«
Es schmerzte, aber ich war von seinem Händespiel so eingenommen, daß ich
ihn nicht fortlassen wollte und sagte: »Nein, gar nicht.«
Jetzt gab er einen stärkern Ruck, und ich glaubte nun, daß mir sein
ganzer Schweif im Leibe sitze. Es war aber, wie er mir nachher sagte,
nur sein halber Schweif gewesen. Immerhin genug für mein Alter, für den
Ort, an dem er sich befand und für seine Riesenlänge. Bisher hatte ich
mich doch auch furchtbar davor geekelt, daß mein Arsch jetzt so
angebohrt wurde. Wie er aber mit dem letzten Ruck so weit eindrang,
spürte ich ein eigentümliches Wonnegefühl, zum Teil schmerzhaft, aber
doch nicht eigentlich so, daß es weh tat, sondern es war mehr die Angst
vor einem Schmerz, und es war auch nicht geradezu Wonne, sondern mehr
das Vorgefühl einer solchen, aber so aufreizend und heftig, daß ich
stöhnen mußte.
Gleich fragte mich Horak: »Tut's dir weh ...?«
Ich konnte nicht antworten, weil ich zu aufgeregt war.
Aber er zog seinen Schweif heraus und fragte noch einmal dringend:
»Tut's dir weh?«
Mir war seine Entfernung unangenehm. So hob ich den Popo, indem ich mich
auf die Zehenspitzen stellte, noch mehr und flüsterte: »Lassen S' ihn
nur drin ..., nur weiter vögeln ...«
Augenblicklich rutschte der warme Stiel wieder in mich hinein, und
erregt flüsterte ich: »... nur weiter vögeln ..., ah ..., so ..., so ...«
Er stieß nicht etwa kräftig zu, sondern strich ganz sanft hin und her
und spielte dabei, mich an der Mitte umfassend, mit meiner Spalte, so
daß ich nach einer Weile glaubte, er sei ganz fest in meiner Fut drin.
Sonderbarerweise mußte ich an den Buben denken, der mich draußen auf dem
Feld gevögelt hatte, an Robert, der mir ja auch ein bißchen
hineingekommen war, an den Herrn Ekhard, und diese Erinnerungen trugen
nur dazu bei, mich aufs Höchste zu erregen und geil zu machen.
Um den Schwanz, der mir hinten im Leibe saß, besser zu spüren, kniff ich
ein paarmal die Arschbacken zusammen, was auf Herrn Horak eine große
Wirkung übte. Er wetzte rascher aus und ein, beugte sich tiefer über
mich und begann mir ins Ohr zu zischeln: »Ja, mein Herzerl ..., schnapp
nur ..., ja, mein Mauserl ..., ah ..., das ist ..., das ist aber ...,
sehr gut ..., hörst ... Du bist eine süße kleine Hur ..., du g'fallst
mir ..., jeden Tag kommst jetzt in Keller zu mir ..., weißt?«
»Jeden Tag?« fragte ich geil und zwickte ihn stärker mit den Arschbacken
in den Schwanz.
Er zuckte und flüsterte heiß: »Jawohl ... du Hur, du kleine ..., du
Mauserl du ..., jeden Tag möcht' ich dich wetzen ..., ah, ah ...«
Mir gefiel das Gespräch, es regte mich noch mehr auf und so gab ich
zurück: »Alle Tag' wolln Sie mich vögeln, Herr Horak? Das geht ja
nicht ...?«
»Warum denn nicht ...?« Er stieß jetzt schon kräftiger.
»Aber«, meinte ich, »wenn die Frau Reinthaler kommt ...«
»Ah was«, flüsterte er, »du mit deinem kleinen Loch und mit deiner
nackten Fut bist mir viel lieber ...«
»Das glaub ich nicht ...«
»Wenn ich's sag.« Er rieb sich jetzt so tief in mich hinein, daß ich
seinen Hodensack gegen meine Schenkel leise anschlagen spürte.
»Aber die Frau Reinthaler«, erinnerte ich ihn, »die hat so schöne
Duteln ...«
»Ich pfeif drauf«, zischelte er. »Du wirst sowieso bald auch Duteln
kriegen.«
»O nein, noch lange nicht ...«
»Aber ja«, er tröstete mich, »tu nur fleißig vögeln, da wachsen die
Duteln g'schwind.« Ich zwickte bei dieser mir so erfreulichen Hoffnung
einigemal hintereinander die Arschbacken zusammen, und da hörte er zu
reden auf: »Ah ..., ah ..., jetzt ..., jetzt ..., jetzt ...« Das war
alles, was er sagte. Aber ich fühlte plötzlich tief in mir etwas Heißes
und wußte, daß er jetzt spritzte. Sein Schweif zuckte und zuckte, seine
Finger gruben sich in meine Fut ein und dabei kam eine heiße Welle nach
der andern, die ich in meinem Leib wie die Berührung einer nassen
weichen Zungenspitze fühlte.
Auch ich schnaufte, ächzte, stöhnte und kniff meinen Hintern zusammen.
Als er mich losließ und ich mich aufrichtete, floß der Saft mir aus dem
Popo heraus, die Schenkel hinunter, so daß ich ganz naß war. Ich spürte
seinen Speer noch in mir nachwirken, hatte Kreuzschmerzen und war von
der großen Aufregung ganz schwindlig.
Herr Horak stand wie ein Betrunkener vor mir und sein Schweif hing ihm
lang und triefend, glänzend vor Feuchtigkeit zur Hose heraus. Er zog
sein Taschentuch, ich nahm es ihm aus der Hand und trocknete seine Nudel
vorsichtig und zärtlich ab.
»Hörst du«, sagte er zu mir, »du bist aber wie eine ausg'lernte Hur ...
So was ist mir noch nicht unterkommen...«
Statt aller Antwort fing ich nochmals von der Frau Reinthaler an:
»Schöne Duteln hat sie ..., so dick und so weiß ...«
Er meinte: »Aber du bist mir lieber ...«
Das machte mich stolz, und ich fragte ihn: »Wenn sie aber doch einmal
herunterkommt ...?«
»Na, was willst denn?«
»Wen werdn Sie dann vögeln«, forschte ich, »sie oder mich?«
»Selbstverständlich«, bekräftigte er, »selbstverständlich dich!«
»Was wird aber dann die Frau Reinthaler sagen?«
»Soll's sagen, was will ...«
»Alsdann, ich geh' ...« Ich wandte mich zur Treppe. Aber er hielt mich
auf.
»Geh, bleib noch«, bat er nun. Er saß jetzt wieder auf seinem Faß, hielt
mich zwischen seinen Knien und fragte: »Also erzähl mir, du hast schon
früher gevögelt?«
»So wie heut noch nicht.«
»Und wie denn?«
»Gar nicht.«
»Lüg nicht. Du hast mir's doch früher selbst g'sagt.«
»Na ja ...«
»Also mit wem ...?«
»Ich weiß nicht.«
»Mit einem fremden Mann?«
»Ja, mit einem Soldaten.«
»Wo denn?«
»Am Fürstenfeld ...«
»Ja, wie ist denn das gekommen ...?«
»Er hat mich auf die Erd' gehaut und hat sich draufgelegt...«
»Warum hast denn nicht geschrien ...?«
»Weil ich Angst g'habt hab vor ihm.«
Er zog mich an sich: »Na, vielleicht hast es auch gern getan ...?«
Ich schüttelte den Kopf: »O nein.«
»Aber«, meinte er, »mit mir tust es gern?«
Ich umarmte ihn und küßte sein hübsches rotes Gesicht. Als ich wegging,
rief er mir scherzend nach: »Servus, kleine Geliebte!«
In diesen Tagen hatte ich den Herrn Ekhard ganz vergessen. Ich lauerte
immer auf den Herrn Horak, den ich eine Weile nicht sah. Ich ließ mich
von Franz nach unserer alten Manier behüpfen und paßte in der Nacht
auf, ob ich meine Eltern nicht wieder erwische. Einmal sah ich sie, wie
sich die Mutter von hinten vögeln ließ. Dann wieder konnte ich bemerken,
daß der Vater unten lag und die Mutter oben, und einmal hörte ich ein
Gespräch. Ich war eben vom Bettkrachen aufgewacht. Meine Mutter lag
nackt da, der Vater hatte ihre Beine über seine Achsel genommen und
vögelte heftig, und ich vernahm eben, wie er sagte: »Jetzt kommt's mir.«
Die Mutter rief flüsternd dazwischen: »Wart noch ... halt's noch zurück
... so wart doch ...« Aber er spritzte, was ich daraus merkte, daß er
die Beine der Mutter losließ, ganz auf sie niedersank und laut ächzte.
Die Mutter sagte auch gleich darauf: »So schön, jetzt ist's mir nicht
einmal gekommen.«
Nach einer Weile, in der beide ruhig waren, fing sie an: »Kannst nicht
noch eine Nummer machen?«
»Vielleicht später«, brummte der Vater.
Aber sie war ganz zornig: »Ah, was später ..., da schnarchst du ja so
ein, daß du nicht zum derwecken bist ...«
»Ich kann jetzt nicht ...«
»Hättst dich zurückgehalten, ich will auch was haben«, schalt die
Mutter.
Der Vater wollte sie vertrösten: »Mußt halt warten bis später.«
Sie atmete keuchend, schwieg ein paar Minuten, dann fing sie wieder an:
»Steht er dir nimmer?«
»Jetzt nicht.«
»Wart!« sagte die Mutter, »ich werd' ihn schon in die Höh' bringen ...«
Sie setzte sich im Bett auf, und ich sah, wie sie über den Vater gebeugt
heftig an seinem Schweif herumarbeitete. Er griff ihr dabei ein paarmal
an die Brust, lag aber dann ganz still da. Das dauerte beinahe eine
viertel Stunde. Dann sagte er verdrießlich: »So laß doch, es geht ja
nicht, du siehst es ja ...«
Die Mutter weinte beinahe: »Was soll man denn da tun ...? Was soll man
denn da tun ...?«
»Garnix kannst machen ...«, brummte der Vater, »laß stehen ..., es geht
halt nicht mehr ...«
Die Mutter jammerte, riß aber noch weiter an dem Schwanz herum. Dann
sagte sie schwach: »Mir tut schon die Hand weh ...«, und gleich darauf:
»Probier' ich's halt so ...« Sie bückte sich und nahm die weiche Nudel
in den Mund. Ich hörte sie lutschen und schmatzen und dabei schnaufen.
Nach einer Weile aber fuhr sie wieder auf und war zornig: »Er steht und
steht halt nicht. Jessas, das is ein Kreuz mit so ein' Mann ..., das
versteht er, daß er mir zwei-, dreimal die Fut auswetzt und dann spritzt
er ganz teppert hinein und denkt nicht dran, daß die Frau auch was haben
will.«
Mein Vater sagte kein Wort. Die Mutter aber gab nicht nach: »Ja, was tu'
ich denn nur ..., jetzt hat mich das Vögeln so aufgeregt ..., und dann
das Spielen mit dem Schwanz, und das in den Mund nehmen ..., was tu' ich
denn nur ..., das machst mir aber öfters so ..., das kenn' ich jetzt
schon ..., da kann man ja narrisch werdn ... Was möchst denn du sagen,
wenn ich dich wegstoßen möcht vor dem Spritzen? Was? ... Du möchst halt
zu einer andern gehn ..., die Mannsbilder ..., die können sich leicht
helfen, die laufen halt zu einer Hur ... Aber ich ..., was wär' denn,
wenn ich mich jetzt von ein' andern vögeln lassen möcht'?«
»Mach was d'willst ...«
»So? Na, das werd' ich mir merken! Glaubst ich find' keinen, der was
mich vögeln will ...?«
Der Vater setzte sich im Bett auf, warf die Mutter um und griff ihr
zwischen die Beine. Sofort verstummte der Redefluß meiner Mutter. Sie
warf und schleuderte sich unter der Hand des Vaters, der sie nach allen
Regeln der Fingerkunst bearbeitete und keuchte nun hörbar. Der Vater
faßte mit der freien Hand nach der Brust der Mutter, spielte mit den
Warzen und bald vernahm ich, wie sie flüsterte: »Jetzt ..., jetzt
kommt's ..., steck den Finger ganz hinein, ganz ..., so ..., so ...,
ah ..., ah ...«
Der Vater brummte: »Na also, daß die arme Seel a Ruh hat.«
Gleich darauf schnarchten sie beide, nur ich lag wach und aufgeregt da,
und wußte nicht, was ich mir jetzt wünschen sollte, den Franz, den
Ferdl, den Robert, den Herrn Ekhard, den Herrn Horak, den Soldaten oder
den Buben aus dem Gebüsch dort. Bei einigen Buben aus unserem Haus und
aus der Gasse, in der wir wohnten, war ich jetzt sehr bekannt. Wieder
muß ich es wohl meinem Gesichtsausdruck und der unwillkürlichen
Beredsamkeit meiner Augen zuschreiben, daß sie alle so ohne weiteres
annahmen, ich lasse mich vögeln, und man brauche mich nur anzugreifen.
Freilich waren alle diese Buben ebenso verdorben wie ich und mein
Bruder, und sie alle vögelten ganz wie selbstverständlich ihre
Schwestern, ihre Freundinnen, kurz was sie eben kriegen konnten. Wenn
ich solche, mir oft ganz unbekannte Buben im Hausflur, auf der Treppe
oder auf der Straße begegnete, dann schlugen sie mich wie zur Begrüßung
mit der flachen Hand leicht gegen die Fut, wogegen ich sie abwehrte,
oder ihnen, wenn sie mir gefielen, an das Hosentürl griff.
Mit Mädchen aus der Schule hatte ich wenig Umgang in dieser Zeit. Ich
war verschwiegen, und sprach ich manchmal mit einer davon, dann
vertraute sie mir entweder gleich an, daß sie schon selbst vögeln könne,
oder sie sah mich verständnislos, wohl auch verächtlich an und mied von
da ab den Umgang mit mir.
Es geschah mehreremale, daß ein Bub, den ich durch so einen Griff an
sein Hosentürl gereizt hatte, nicht locker ließ. Ich ging mit ihm dann
stets in den Vorkeller, der ja immer offenstand, und dort vögelten wir
in aller Eile stehend, worauf wir auseinander liefen. Vielleicht mit
sechs oder acht Buben hab' ich es in dieser Zeit so getrieben.
Zwei Buben aber sind mir in Erinnerung geblieben, und die Geschichte des
einen hängt in ihrem ferneren Verlauf mit dem Herrn Ekhard zusammen.
Dieser Bub, er hieß Alois, war der Sohn unseres Hausherrn, ein feiner
Bursch mit schönen blonden Haaren, mit einem dunkelbraunen Samtanzug,
kurzen Hosen, obwohl er schon zwölf Jahre zählte. Ich glaube, daß ich
ihn geliebt habe, denn sooft ich ihn traf, zitterte ich vor Sehnsucht
bei seinem Anblick. Er schien mir so stolz und fein und brav, und ich
schämte mich sehr vor ihm, mußte ihn aber immer ansehen. Er schaute mir
immer mit einem kurzen Blick ins Gesicht und wandte sich dann mit
hochmütiger Gleichgültigkeit von mir ab.
Man konnte mit ihm nicht sprechen, denn er war immer von einem kleinen,
furchtbar dicken Stubenmädchen begleitet, die schon recht ältlich war
und eine schiefe Schulter hatte.
Zufällig traf ich ihn aber einmal an einem Nachmittag allein im
Parterrekorridor vor der Kellertüre, um die ich geil herumschlich und
auf einen Buben, gleichviel auf welchen, wartete. Ich zitterte vor
Achtung und Sehnsucht, als ich ihn so unvermutet und allein vor mir
erblickte. Er war ohne Hut, hatte aber seinen großen weißen
Schillerkragen und seinen Samtanzug an. Alois blieb vor mir stehen und
sah mich an. Ich traute mich nicht, ein Wort zu sprechen, wollte aber,
daß er mit mir in den Keller gehen solle. Da er nichts redete, lächelte
ich. Er blieb ernst. Ich wagte es endlich, ihn zu fragen: »Warst schon
einmal im Keller unten ...?«
»Nein«, erwiderte er ernst. »Aber gehn wir zusammen herunter.«
Auf der Treppe meinte er leise: »Kann uns da niemand sehen ...?«
Dieser Ausspruch einigte uns und brachte sofort alles zwischen uns ins
Klare. Trotzdem unterstand ich mich nicht, ihn anzugreifen und flüsterte
nur: »Es ist ja niemand da.«
Er sagte nichts, aber unten im halbdunklen Gang standen wir einander
gegenüber und redeten kein Wort. Uns beiden war wohl bang, aber ich war
so unendlich glücklich, daß ich den Atem anhielt. Er streichelte mich an
der Wange, und ich traute mich, diese Liebkosung zu erwidern. Dann
streichelte er mich auf der Brust, und endlich strich seine Hand immer
tiefer und tiefer, bis sie über den Kleidern auf meiner Fut lag. Ich
stand gegen die Wand gelehnt, still und bebend. Er preßte seine Hand
stärker zwischen meine Beine. Ich gab nach, und er tastete über den
Kleidern an derselben Stelle hinan.
»Magst?« flüsterte er leise.
Ich sträubte mich. Zum erstenmal sträubte ich mich und sagte: »Wenn aber
wer kommt ...?«
Er hob mir langsam die Röcke auf und stellte sich zwischen meine Beine.
Sein Gesicht blieb ernst, und ich fühlte, wie er mit seinem Schweif an
meinem Loch herumtastete. Ich war so aufgeregt, daß es mir
augenblicklich kam, sowie ich nur die erste Berührung seiner warmen
Eichel wahrnahm. Meine Geilheit hielt jedoch an. Davon, daß es mir
gekommen war, und wohl auch von meiner Aufregung, war meine Spalte ganz
feucht geworden.
Er blieb immer ernst und ruhig. Mit der einen Hand faßte er meinen Popo,
drückte mich gegen sich, so daß ich nur mit dem Rücken an der Mauer
lehnte, und im nächsten Moment ächzte ich schwer auf, weil ich einen
Aufschrei der Wollust unterdrückt hatte. Mit einem einzigen, wunderbar
geschickten Stoß war er mir nämlich ganz bis ans Heft in den Leib
gefahren. Es war ein fester, sehr kurzer und ziemlich dicker Schweif,
und er rührte sich ein paar Sekunden nicht, als er ihn hineingesteckt
hatte. Dann führte er kurze Stöße gegen mich, aber ohne daß er seinen
Schwanz dabei nur einen Millimeter herauszog. Er blieb wie angegossen
drinnen stecken, und ich war halb besinnungslos vor Geilheit. Dann fing
er an im Kreise zu bohren, als wollte er mein Loch ausweiten, aber er
blieb dabei immer tief drinnen stecken. Das war mir noch nicht
geschehen. Ich quietschte leise, weil es mir wieder kam und Alois sagte
auf einmal: »Schluß mit Genuß!« Ehe ich Zeit hatte über diesen Ausdruck
überrascht zu sein, änderte er seine Stoßweise, zog nämlich seinen
Schwanz langsam ganz heraus, fuhr dann langsam wieder ganz hinein, so
etwa vier- bis fünfmal, und dann spürte ich ihn spritzen; es war nicht
viel, aber doch spritzte er, sein Stachel zuckte heftig, wie er jetzt
herein zu mir kam, und ganz gleichzeitig mit ihm kam es auch mir zum
letztenmale. Als er fertig war, wischte er sich den Schweif an meinem
Hemd ab, steckte ihn in die Hose, klopfte mich auf die Wange und sagte:
»Du puderst besser als die Klementine ...« Da ich nicht wußte, wer die
Klementine sei, schwieg ich, aber ich wunderte mich gar nicht, daß so
ein feiner Bub vögeln könne, mit wem er will. Bevor er wegging, schlug
er mir vor: »Komm morgen nachmittag zu mir. Meine Eltern fahren fort, da
sind wir allein.«
Am andern Nachmittag läutete ich klopfenden Herzens an der Türe der
Hausherrenwohnung. Die Köchin öffnete mir: »Ist der Herr Alois da ...?«
fragte ich schüchtern.
Sie lachte: »Ja, der -- junge Herr ist da drin ...«
Ich wurde in sein Zimmer gewiesen, das sehr groß und wunderschön weiß
möbliert war. Mir kam es wie im Paradies vor. Er zeigte mir sein schön
lackiertes weißes Bett, das hellblau überzogen war. Dann seinen großen
Diwan, der weiß und blau überzogen war und sagte, auf das Bett deutend:
»Da schlaf' ich«, und auf den Diwan weisend: »Da schlaft das
Kindermädel.«
Dann zeigte er mir seine Bilderbücher, seine Soldaten, seine Gewehre und
seinen Säbel, und ich hätte nie gedacht, hatte es nie geahnt, daß es ein
Kind so gut haben könne. Mir fiel es gar nicht ein, daß man in so einem
herrlichen Zimmer auch solche Dinge machen könne, wie das, was wir
gestern im Keller getan hatten.
Nach ein paar Minuten kam das kleine, dicke, ältliche Kindermädel
herein, das Alois immer begleitete, wenn er in die Schule ging oder aus
der Schule kam. Wir waren also nicht mehr allein, und so entfiel für
mich auch der letzte Gedanke an eine Wiederholung der gestrigen Spiele.
Das Kindermädchen setzte sich auf den Diwan und strickte und kümmerte
sich gar nicht um uns, und wir saßen bei dem Tisch, der ganz mit
Soldaten bedeckt war und spielten. Auf einmal stand Alois auf, ging zum
Kindermädchen, stellte sich vor sie hin und griff ihr an den dicken,
weit vorstehenden Busen. Ich war so paff, daß ich sprachlos dasaß. Sie
stieß ihn weg und brummte. »Aber Alois ...« Und dabei schaute sie
mißtrauisch zu mir herüber. Alois sagte: »Laß nur gehen ... die Pepi
versteht schon alles.« Und wieder griff er ihr an die großen,
vorstehenden Brüste. Sie ließ sich abtätscheln, ohne ihn weiter
abzuwehren, und meinte nur: »Verstehn wird die Pepi schon, das glaub'
ich, aber ob sie's nicht weitersagt ...?« Ich stand statt aller Antwort
vom Sessel auf, ging auch zu ihr hin, nahm ihre andere Brust und preßte
sie. Sie war ganz weich und wellig, und das knochige, ältliche Gesicht
der Kindermagd mit den schielenden kleinen Augen wurde ganz rot. Alois
hatte schon seinen Schweif herausgezogen und drückte ihn dem Kindermädel
in die Hand. Sie ergriff ihn und spielte damit, aber nicht so wie ich es
immer machte. Sie hielt ihn mit dem Mittel- und Daumenfinger und mit dem
Zeigefinger tupfte sie leise an die Eichel, daß die Vorhaut immer mehr
davon herunterging.
»Kennst du das?« fragte sie mich mit einem Lächeln, das auf ihrem
mürrischen Gesicht wie ein Grinsen sich ausnahm.
»O ja ...«, nickte ich.
»Na, und wie heißt das?«
»Ein Schwanz«, sagte ich leise.
»Und was macht der Schwanz?« Sie prüfte mich.
»Vögeln ...«, antwortete ich flüsternd.
Sie begann zu schnaufen und klopfte rascher mit ihrem Zeigefinger auf
die rosige Eichel von Alois. »Und ... was vögelt er ... der
Schwanz ...?« Sie schnappte mit den Lippen.
»Die Fut ...«, antwortete Alois für mich. Er hatte seiner Klementine --
ich wußte jetzt, wer die Klementine sei, von der er gestern im Keller
gesprochen hatte -- die Bluse aufgerissen und wühlte mit beiden Händen in
ihren hin und her schwappenden Brüsten. Sie ließ von mir ab und prüfte
jetzt Alois. Ich merkte, es war ein Spiel, das die beiden oft geübt
hatten.
»Was tut der Schwanz in der Fut?«
»Vögeln.« Alois antwortete gleichmäßig, ernst und so ruhig wie immer.
Mit zitterndem Mund fragte Klementine weiter: »Wie heißt das noch ...?«
Und Alois zählte auf: »Pudern, Ficken, Remmeln, Bimsen, Petschieren,
Stemmen.« Sein Ton war ernst.
Klementine aber wurde immer aufgeregter.
»Was kann der Schwanz noch?«
»Im Popo kitzeln ..., in' Mund spritzen ..., zwischen den Duteln
liegen ...«
»Und was will der Alois jetzt machen ...?«
Ohne seine Antwort abzuwarten, lehnte sie sich zurück und schloß die
Augen. Alois öffnete ihre Bluse mehr und nahm ihre beiden Brüste heraus.
Sie hingen tief herab und ich sah, daß sie Warzen hatte, die so weit
wegstanden wie ein kleiner Finger. Alois nahm abwechselnd die eine dann
die andere Brust in die Hände, nahm die Warzen in den Mund und sog mit
aller Kraft dran, daß es schmatzte, und jedesmal zuckte Klementine mit
derjenigen Schulter, die der eben geküßten Brust entsprach. Es war ein
Zucken, das ihr wie ein epileptischer Krampf oder wie ein elektrischer
Schlag durch die eine Körperhälfte ging. Sie hatte den Kopf auf die
Diwanlehne zurückgelehnt, hielt die Augen geschlossen, und Alois
arbeitete wie abgerichtet. Nachdem er sie so eine Weile, bald links,
bald rechts an den Brustwarzen begeilt hatte, bückte er sich, hob ihr
die Röcke in die Höhe, daß die nackten, kurzen, dicken Beine
Klementinens sichtbar wurden. Alois glättete die aufgeschürzten Röcke
auf Klementinens Bauch, daß sie nicht bauschten, dann trat er zwischen
ihre Beine, hielt mit der einen Hand ihre dicht behaarte Fut gespreizt,
und mit der anderen lenkte er seinen kurzen, strammen Schweif geschickt
ins Loch, so daß er mit einem Ruck bis an der Wurzel drin war. Dann
legte er sich auf Klementine, und nun ergriff sie ihn mit beiden Händen
am Popo und hielt ihn fest an sich, so daß er wohl stoßen, aber nicht
ein Haarbreit hinaus konnte. Klementine hielt ihre Augen geschlossen und
schnappte nach Luft. Alois hatte jetzt in jeder Hand eine Brustwarze von
ihr und zupfte wie mechanisch daran. Er war ernst wie tags zuvor, da er
mich im Kellergang so gut gevögelt hatte. Nach etwa zehn Minuten sagte
Klementine auf einmal: »Schluß mit Genuß«, worauf sie ihre Hände vom
Popo Alois' losließ. Er fuhr jetzt, wie ich sah, langsam ganz hinein.
Klementine sprang vor Wollust mit ihrem Hinterteil in die Höhe. Dann
steckte er ihn wieder langsam, langsam ganz heraus, und Klementine bekam
ihr epilepsieähnliches Zucken, so stark, daß man meinen konnte, es
reiße sie entzwei. Wieder zog Alois seinen Schweif langsam heraus.
Klementine drohte zu ersticken. Wieder drang er allmählich und zögernd
in sie ein, und sie ward von ihren Zuckungen wild gebeutelt. Alois
selbst blieb ernst. Das wiederholte sich so sechs- bis achtmal,
währenddem er immer aufmerksam in Klementinens Gesicht schaute. So wie
aber der Krampf aus ihren Zügen wich und sie in Befriedigtsein
erschlaffend ganz in sich zusammenfiel, wurde Alois plötzlich dunkelrot,
stieß zweimal heftig zu und fiel dann mit dem Gesicht auf Klementinens
nackte Brust. Er hatte gespritzt.
Eine Minute lang blieb er so liegen, und Klementine ganz still unter
ihm, und ich stand dabei und hatte nicht übel Lust, mir die Röcke
aufzuheben und mich selbst zu bedienen. Dann aber richtete sich
Klementine auf. Alois löste sich von ihr, wischte seinen Schweif an der
Innenseite ihres Rockes ab, und wir drei saßen nebeneinander auf dem
Diwan. Klementine sah mich von der Seite her an: »Na, hat's dir denn
gefallen ...?«
Ich lächelte nur. Und Alois, der auf der anderen Seite saß, schaute über
Klementinens Busenwölbung zu mir herüber. Sie fragte mich: »Kennst du
das schon?« Ich lächelte wieder statt einer Antwort. Sie forschte
weiter: »Hast du's schon einmal gemacht?« Ihr gegenüber, ich weiß selbst
nicht warum, wagte ich es nicht, die Sache zu leugnen. Ja sagen wollte
ich auch nicht, und so lachte ich verschämt, was ja ganz gut als
Zustimmung gelten konnte. Klementine meinte: »Das werden wir gleich
sehen.« Ohne Umstände hob sie mir die Röcke in die Höhe und untersuchte
meine Fut. »Uh jeh«, meinte sie, während sie daran herumgriff, »da ist
schon manches geschehen.« Mit großer Behutsamkeit und eh ich mich
dessen versah, bohrte sie mir ihren kleinen Finger ins Loch: »Aber da
kann man ja schon hinein«, rief sie aus. Und zu Alois gewendet fuhr sie
fort: »Alois, da kann man schon hinein.« Ich zuckte bei diesen Worten,
und sie bemerkte es. »Soll der Alois jetzt dich vögeln?« fragte sie.
»Ja«, antwortete ich ihr ohne Zaudern, denn ich hatte schon gefürchtet,
ich werde leer ausgehen. Sie drehte sich wieder zu Alois und redete ihn
an: »Na Bubi, magst du das schöne Mädi da auch ein bissel pudern? Was
glaubst du, ha?« Alois stand auf und wollte sich mir nähern. Klementine
aber hielt ihn ab. »Wart«, meinte sie, »ich will dir erst wieder dein
Schwanzerl richten.« Diese Vorsicht war gewiß nötig, denn Alois' Zipfel
hing ziemlich trübselig herab. Er mochte mit Klementine schon mehr
Reitpartien gemacht haben, als für sein Alter zuträglich war. Aber
freilich, die Wiederaufrichtung hätte ich selbst ebenso gut und ebenso
gerne besorgt. Allerdings wäre es mir nicht möglich gewesen, es auf
dieselbe Weise zu tun wie Klementine. Sie nahm den schlappen Schwanz
zuerst in ihren Mund und feuchtete ihn an, hierauf bettete sie ihn genau
zwischen ihre beiden Brüste und preßte diese mit den eigenen Händen so
zusammen, daß es aussah, als vögle Alois in einen weichen Popo hinein.
Auch das schien die gute Klementine sehr aufzuregen, so daß ich schon
fürchtete, sie werde mich wieder um die Sache betrügen. Sie redete
fortwährend dabei: »Wo ist denn mein Loisl jetzt ... was? ... Ist er
jetzt bei die guten, lieben Duterln ... ja ... ist das nicht gut? Was
... so! so! ... Langsam steht er wieder, ha? ... Wer hat denn jetzt
schön gevögelt ..., was ..., wer denn ...? Der Loisl ...? Ja ...! Hat
der Loisl aber eine gute Klementine ... nicht wahr ...? Das möcht' eine
andere nicht tun ..., was ...? so einen kleinen Buben pudern lassen ...,
gelt? Aber die Klementine laßt das Loisl pudern ..., nicht wahr ...,
sooft er will ..., nicht wahr ...?« Und halb zu mir gewendet, fuhr sie
fort: »Da in der Nacht ..., wenn alles schon still ist ..., da kommt der
Loisl aus dem Bett schön auf den Diwan her zu mir ... und da tun wir's
so gut miteinander machen ..., was? Der Loisl kann's aber auch gut, und
das hat ihm die Klementine gelernt ..., ja!«
Ich glaubte schon nicht mehr, daß ich daran komme, aber Loisl zog seinen
Schwanz aus der Dutelpresse heraus und fragte: »Also soll ich jetzt die
Pepi nehmen ...?« Sein Schweif stand wieder kerzengerad, und ich mußte
mich zurückhalten, nicht danach zu greifen, denn ich fürchtete mich vor
dieser dicken, häßlichen Person, die noch zu überlegen schien, ob sie's
erlauben solle. Mochte sie nun mein Stillschweigen damit erkaufen
wollen, daß sie auch mich von ihrem Alois besteigen ließ, oder mochte
sie sich ein begeilendes Schauspiel daraus versprechen, daß sie dem
Vögeln zusah, das weiß ich natürlich heute nicht mehr. Kurzum, sie
willigte ein und rückte auf dem Diwan zur Seite. Ich mußte mich mit dem
Kopf in ihren Schoß legen. Alois bestieg mich, streifte mir mit seinem
ernsten Gesicht die Röcke hinauf, glättete sie, dann spreizte er mit
seinen Fingern meine Spalte und mit einem einzigen Ruck war er wieder,
wie am Tag zuvor bei mir, nur noch tiefer und besser, weil wir diesmal
nicht stehen mußten.
Gerne hätte ich was gesagt, hätte ihn gestreichelt oder dergleichen,
denn mir gingen seine kurzen, regelmäßigen Stöße durch Mark und Bein.
Ich empfand aber eine lebhafte Scheu vor Klementine, in deren Schoß ich
lag, und die mir aufmerksam ins Gesicht blickte. Dafür redete sie desto
mehr.
»Ist er drin bei dir?« fragte sie mich.
»Ganz drin ist er«, flüsterte ich zu ihr empor.
Sie schob ihren Arm zwischen unsere aneinander gedrückten Leiber und
tastete über meinen Bauch nach meiner Fut hin. Dort spielte sie bald an
meiner Spalte, bald wieder an Alois' Hodensack. Ich keuchte, weil ihr
Busen dabei ganz auf meinem Gesicht lag.
Sie richtete sich wieder auf und setzte ihre Fragen fort: »Schmeckt's
dir?«
Ich gab keine Antwort, sondern schloß die Augen.
»Gelt ja?« sagte sie, »der Loisl vögelt gut ...?«
»Ja«, rief ich aus und begann nun unter ihm mit dem Popo zu hüpfen.
»Hast du schon einmal so gut gevögelt ...?« wollte sie wissen.
»Nein ...« Und mir war wirklich so, als hätte ich noch niemals eine
solche Wonne gespürt.
»Mit wem vögelst du denn sonst ...?« erkundigte sie sich weiter.
»Mit'n Fredl«, sag ich, weil der ja nicht mehr im Hause wohnte. Aber vor
Klementine gab es keine Lügen.
»Mit wem noch?« Sie fragte das in so strengem Ton, daß ich ihr antworten
mußte.
»Mit dem Robert ...«
»Und weiter ...?«
»Mit meinem Bruder ...« Unter den Stößen, die ich empfing und die mich
mit aufregungsvoller Lust erschütterten, fielen diese Namen wie von
selbst aus meinem Mund. Glücklicherweise forschte sie nicht weiter,
sondern kam auf eine neue Idee. Sie öffnete mein Leibchen, schob mir
das Hemd so weit herunter, daß meine kleinen Brustwarzen bloßlagen,
feuchtete ihre Fingerspitze an, und spielte leise wie mit einer
leckenden Zunge daran herum. Immer schneller, immer schneller, und bald
traten meine Brustwarzen, die ganz flach gewesen waren, wie die kleinen
Linsen so groß, hervor und wurden ganz hart. Dazu vollführte Alois jetzt
seine drehenden Bewegungen, die mir die Fut ausweiteten, die mich aber
ganz verrückt machten vor Kitzel. Unter dieser Behandlung schwand mir
alle Scheu, ich kreischte leise, rief: »Ach, mir kommt's ..., mir
kommt's ...!« und warf mich mit meinem Popo jeder Bewegung, die Alois
ausführte, entgegen. Mir schien der Reiz, den das Vögeln gewährt, von
überall herzukommen, nicht nur aus der Fut allein. Sanfte und heiße
Schauer flogen mir über die Brust, zuckten mir über den Rücken, huschten
überall auf meinem Körper herum, so daß ich es nicht auszuhalten
glaubte. Wie nun gar Alois jetzt mit den Worten: »Schluß mit Genuß«
endete, womit er sich zum Spritzen anschickte, wie er jetzt langsam ganz
herausfuhr, so daß ich die Fut aus Angst ihres Inhaltes beraubt zu
werden, heftig zusammenzog; wie er nun wieder langsam einfuhr, daß ich
mit meiner Spalte zuschnappte vor Wonne, diesen dicken, blutwarmen
Schaft wieder zu spüren, und wie Klementine dabei meine Brustwarzen
streichelte, kam es mir dreimal hintereinander. Das dritte mal ging ein
Zerren und Strecken durch meinen ganzen Körper bis in die Fußspitzen, so
daß meine große Zehe sich wie im Krampf schmerzhaft verbog, und ich
einen harten Schrei ausstieß. Klementine aber hielt mir a Tempo noch den
Mund zu. In diesem Augenblick drang wie eine kleine brennheiße Welle
der Same von Alois zu mir. Ich fühlte, wie sein Schweif im Ausspritzen
pulsierte, und zum viertenmal kam es mir, aber so heftig wie noch nie.
Und weil ich nicht schreien konnte, biß und leckte ich die innere Fläche
der Hand Klementinens, die sie fest auf meinen Lippen gepreßt hielt.
Ich mußte noch eine Stunde lang am Diwan liegen bleiben, so aufgelöst
und ermüdet war ich von dieser Remmelei. Und ich sah zu, wie Klementine
Alois auf den Diwan stehen ließ, mit dem Rücken gegen die Lehne. Sie saß
vor ihm, ließ seinen Schweif wieder in ihren Busen hängen, und dann nahm
sie ihn heraus. Er hing noch immer schlapp herunter. Da nahm sie ihn in
den Mund, suzelte daran, und mit ihrer Zungenspitze leckte sie an seinen
Hoden. Sie drückte ihren Kopf zwischen seine Beine, und leckte ihn tief
unten, zwischen Schwanz und Popo, und ich sah wie es ihn vor diesem Reiz
beutelte. Aber er machte dasselbe, ernste, gleichmäßige Gesicht. Nur als
Klementine jetzt sich seinen Schweif ganz in den Mund stieß und so ein
wenig hin- und herfuhr, wie beim Vögeln mit der Fut, da legte er ihr die
Hand auf den Kopf. Sie rührte sich nicht, hielt den Schwanz im Mund, daß
man nicht das geringste von ihm sah und nur an den Bewegungen ihrer
Wangen konnte ich merken, daß sie heftig daran sog. Auf einmal begann
Alois seine Vögelstöße. Sogleich fuhr Klementine zurück, und ich sah,
daß er Alois wiederum stand, zum drittenmal. Er haschte nach dem Kopf
von Klementine und drückte ihr seinen Schweif wieder in den Mund: »Da
bleiben«, befahl er. Ich staunte nur, wie sie gehorchte. Sie hielt ihren
Mund geduldig hin, und Alois vögelte sie so mit seinen kurzen Stößen,
lange, sehr lange. Ich lag ziemlich teilnahmslos da, ohne Aufregung,
nur mit einer ziemlichen Neugierde. Klementine zuckte am ganzen Körper,
krümmte sich und wand sich hin und her, aber ihre Lippen umschlossen
getreulich den Schweif von Alois. Nur einmal ließ sie ihn los, und bat:
»Komm vögeln, Bubi ..., komm ...« Er aber erwischte sie gleich wieder
und sagte wütend: »Dableiben, kruzifix noch einmal ...« Wieder ließ sie
sich seine Stange in den Mund stecken, und ihn drin hin und herschieben.
Dann sagte Alois leise: »Schluß mit Genuß.« Ich sah, wie sein Schwanz
langsam und weiß aus den roten Lippen Klementinens herausglitt bis zur
Spitze und wie er ganz langsam in ihr wieder verschwand. Das zweitemal
aber riß Klementine sich los: »Nicht spritzen«, bat sie. Alois wollte
ihren Kopf wieder zu sich heran reißen. »Nein, nein«, sagte sie hitzig.
»Bubi soll mich vögeln, vögeln Bubi, nicht in Mund, unten vögeln, wo's
gut ist ...« Sie rauften eine kurze Weile miteinander. Klementine war
furchtbar aufgeregt und plötzlich packte sie Alois wie man ein kleines
Kind unter den Achseln anfaßt, riß ihn mit einem Ruck an sich, warf ihn
auf den Diwan nieder, und eh er sich's versah, hockte sie mit
hochgerafften Kleidern und tief herabbaumelnden Brüsten auf ihm und
begrub seine Lanze in ihren Schoß. Ihr breiter Hinterer flog auf und
nieder, vielleicht sechzigmal in der Minute. Alois hielt eine ihrer
langstieligen Brustwarzen in seinem Mund, und zuletzt lag sie
bewegungslos, ein schnaufender Klumpen auf Alois, der unter ihr ganz
verschwand.
Ich bekam dann zur Jause Chokolade, die ich noch nie getrunken hatte.
Und als ich fortging begleitete mich Klementine hinaus. Im finsteren
Vorzimmer griff sie mir noch einmal unter die Röcke, wühlte ein wenig
in meiner Fut, während sie mir sagte: »Alsdann g'scheiter sein und nix
ausplauschen, dann darfst du wiederkommen.« Sie schenkte mir ein Zehnerl
und schob mich zur Türe hinaus.
Der zweite Bub, der mir besonders lebhaft in Erinnerung geblieben ist,
hieß Schani. Er wohnte ein paar Häuser weiter weg, in derselben Gasse,
in der ich wohnte. Schani war damals dreizehn Jahre alt, und ich mochte
ihn sehr gerne, denn er war ein blasser, schlanker, schöngewachsener
Junge, hatte pechschwarzes Haar und kohlenrabenschwarze Augen, und er
hielt sich immer so nobel, wenn er ging. Wir sagten uns Servus, wenn wir
uns trafen, es war aber sonst nie etwas zwischen uns gewesen, auch im
Gespräch nicht. Weil nämlich Schani mit meinem ältesten Bruder Lorenz in
eine Klasse ging und außerdem auch mit ihm befreundet war, fürchtete ich
mich davor, von solchen Dingen mit ihm zu reden, und dachte, er sei ganz
so keusch wie Lorenz. Manchmal kam er zu Lorenz auf Besuch, sie machten
ihre Aufgaben zusammen und waren beide immer ganz still und ernst. Mit
mir war Schani aber immer freundlich. An einem Nachmittag kam er einmal,
wie Lorenz nicht zu Hause war. Lorenz und Franz hatten aus irgendeinem
Grund zum Vater in die Werkstatt gehen müssen, weit, bis in die
Josefstadt. Die Mutter war in der Waschküche. Als er hörte, daß Lorenz
nicht da sei, wollte er wieder umkehren. Ich bat ihn aber: »Geh, bleib
ein bissl da ...« Er zauderte, und deshalb setzte ich hinzu: »Der Lorenz
muß gleich kommen ...« Und weil er noch immer unschlüssig war, sagte
ich: »Bleib da, ich fürcht' mich immer, wenn ich allein bin.« Da trat er
über die Schwelle. Wir waren beide verlegen und gingen aus der Küche in
das Zimmer. Zwar verschwand unsere Verlegenheit bald, aber wir hatten
uns nichts zu sagen. Mir aber hatten es seine schwarzen Augen angetan,
und ich drückte mich wie eine Schmeichelkatze an ihn heran. Er ließ
sich's gefallen und lächelte; sagte aber nichts. Da schlang ich meine
Arme um seinen Hals und rieb mich mit meinem Unterleib fest an ihn. Ich
erwartete, er werde jetzt tun wie die anderen, mir unter die Röcke
greifen oder seinen Schwanz herausnehmen und in meine Hand legen. Aber
er tat nichts von alledem. Er ließ sich umarmen, lächelte nur und rührte
sich nicht. Wie mir der Gedanke kam, weiß ich nicht, aber ich ließ ihn
los, trat an das Bett, legte mich darauf und sagte: »Komm her.« Er kam
zu mir und stand vor dem Bett. Ich hob ruckweise meine Kleider: »Jetzt
siehst du noch nichts ...?« sagte ich, »jetzt auch noch nicht?« Nun
lagen meine Knie frei. »Jetzt auch noch nicht?« Ich hob wieder ein
bißchen und meine nackten Schenkel kamen zum Vorschein. »Jetzt auch noch
nicht?« Er schaute mich an, lächelte und rührte sich nicht. »Aber
jetzt!« rief ich und deckte mich auf. Er stand da, und ich lag und
wartete. Meine Aufregung war gestiegen, um so mehr, als ich überzeugt
war, daß sein Schwanz, wie der von Alois, ganz zu mir passen würde. Ich
war begierig ihn zu sehen und zu halten und griff nach Schanis Hose. Er
trat einen Schritt zurück. »Laß gehn«, bat er trüb und verlegen, »ich
kann's nicht tun ...«
»Warum nicht?« Ich war mit einem Satz vom Bett unten.
»So nicht. Ich kann's nicht tun ...« sagte er leise.
»Zeig her.« Ich langte schnell nach seinem Hosentürl. »Zeig her, ob du's
nicht kannst.«
Er wollte mir entschlüpfen, aber ich hielt schon seine Knöpfe fest. So
blieb er stehen, und ich wühlte in seiner Hose nach dem Schweif, den ich
auch bald hervorzog. Er war dünn und sehr lang, und mir fiel es nur auf,
daß seine Vorhaut beinahe bis über die ganze Eichel zurückgeschoben war.
Aber sein Schwanz stand so gut wie nur irgendeiner. Und ich war so
begierig, mir ihn in die Spalte zu stecken, daß ich geschwind meine
Röcke aufhob. Er wehrte mich aber wieder ab. »Laß gehn, ich kann nicht.«
Ich war ratlos vor Schreck und Staunen: »Du kannst ja«, sagte ich
eifrig; »du lügst, du kannst schon, du willst nur nicht.«
»Ich kann wirklich nicht. Ich möcht' schon selber gern, aber es geht
nicht.« Er sagte das so ernst und traurig, daß es Eindruck auf mich
machte und ich neugierig wurde. »Dann sag's, warum es nicht geht, wenn's
wahr ist, dann sag's ...«, drängte ich in ihn. Ich hielt seinen Schweif
noch immer in der Hand. Er entwand sich mir, steckte ihn ein und
knöpfelte die Hose zu. »Das kann ich dir nicht sagen.«
»Weil du lügst«, beharrte ich. »Du willst nicht vögeln ..., wenn du
nicht willst, dann sag's nur, aber lüg nicht so!«
»Ich lüg' nicht«, wiederholte er. Dann griff er mir, ohne mir die
Kleider aufzuheben, an die Fut, zögerte ein wenig und wiederholte
zuletzt: »Nein, ich kann nicht ...«
»Ja, aber wegen was denn?«
»Wegen dieser verfluchten Frauenzimmer ...« brach er los.
»Was denn für Frauenzimmer ...?«
»Zweimal hab' ich heut schon pudern müssen ...«, sagte er zornig.
»Wen denn ...?« Ich brannte vor Begierde, es zu hören.
»Zweimal«, wiederholte er. »Und wenn ich dich jetzt vögel, dann steht er
mir auf die Nacht nicht, und dann haut sie mich durch.«
»Ja, wer denn?«
»Die Mutter ...«
»Deine Mutter ...?«
»Ja.«
»Die haut dich durch, wenn dir der Schwanz nicht steht ...?«
»Ja.«
»Aber warum denn? Vögelst du vielleicht gar deine Mutter?«
»Ich muß ...« Er war in Zorn geraten. »Diese gottsverfluchten
Frauenzimmer«, rief er aus, »die sind ja alle miteinand so schlecht ...«
»Und heut hast sie schon zweimal gevögelt ...?«
»O nein, sie kommt erst am Abend z' Haus.«
»Alsdann, wen hast du denn gefickt?«
»Meine Schwestern ...«
»Deine Schwestern ...? Alle zwei ...?«
»Ja, alle zwei, und wenn ich dich jetzt vögeln möcht', dann möcht er mir
vielleicht am Abend im Bett nicht stehn, und dann weiß die Mutter
gleich, daß ich mit der Rosa und mit der Wetti was gemacht hab, und dann
schlagt sie mich.«
Und nun erzählte er mir eine ganze Geschichte. Ich brauchte gar nicht
mehr hin- und herfragen. Es war ihm offenbar selbst ein Bedürfnis, sich
mir anzuvertrauen. Seinen Vater hatte er nie gekannt, wußte sich seiner
auch kaum zu erinnern, denn der war gestorben, als Schani noch ein ganz
kleines Kind war. Seine Schwestern hatte ich oft gesehen. Seine Mutter
auch. Die Mutter war eine eher kleine, ganz magere Frau, noch nicht alt.
Und sie hatte so schöne schwarze Augen wie ihr Sohn. Rosa, die älteste,
war achtzehn Jahre alt, ein blondes schlankes Mädchen, das wohl viel
Sommersprossen hatte, dafür aber zwei harte, hoch aufstehende, spitze
Brüste, und Wetti, die jüngere, die sechzehn Jahre alt war und dick,
kurz, mit vollen jungen Brüsten und einem breiten Popo, daß ihr die
Männer auf der Straße nachliefen. Wetti hatte angefangen. Sie war als
zwölfjähriges Kind von einem Kolporteur, der mit Schauerromanen
hausieren ging, entjungfert worden, als er sie einmal allein zu Haus
traf. Der Mann hatte sie jedoch keineswegs vergewaltigt, sondern es war
eher anzunehmen, daß Wetti ihn verführt hatte. Denn sie begann damals
eben sich zu entwickeln und schaute alle Männer mit verlockenden Augen
an.
Von diesem Abenteuer erzählte sie ihrem Bruder, sie zeigte ihm, wie das
geschehen war, und die beiden spielten seither öfter »Kolporteur«. Eines
Tages, als sie mitten im Kolporteurspielen waren, erwischte sie Rosa.
Sie blieb ganz ruhig vor ihnen stehen, und als die beiden erschrocken
auffuhren, sagte sie: »Was treibt ihr denn da?« Natürlich bekam sie
keine Antwort. Wetti und Schani fürchteten sich, die große Schwester
werde sie prügeln oder verraten. Es geschah aber nichts von alledem.
Rosa prügelte sie nicht und verriet sie nicht. Dafür rief sie in der
Nacht, als die drei Geschwister, die in einem Zimmer beisammen
schliefen, schon im Bett lagen, Schani zu sich. Schani kam. »Was hast du
heute mit der Wetti getan?« -- »Nichts.« -- »So? wegen nichts hast du
ihr die Röcke aufgehoben, und die Duteln herausgenommen?« -- »O, wir
haben uns nur gespielt ...« -- »Na, so zeig mir, wie ihr euch gespielt
habt.«
Schani stand neben dem Bett im Finstern. Wetti schlief, im Kabinett
schlief die Mutter, und diese Zwiesprache ward flüsternd gehalten. »Zeig
mir, wie ihr euch gespielt habt ...« Schani rührte sich nicht.
Da sagte Rosa: »Komm, leg dich zu mir ...« und lüftete die Decke.
Als Schani zu seiner Schwester ins Bett geschlüpft war, merkte er, daß
sie kein Hemd anhatte, sondern nackt dalag. Er begann sofort mit ihren
Brüsten zu spielen, die ihm schon lang gefallen hatten. Und Rosa ergriff
seinen Schweif, sie streichelte ihn, preßte ihn und war so aufgeregt,
daß sie kaum zu sprechen vermochte. Auch Schani war ganz geil geworden,
dennoch hatte er Angst. Er hatte immer nur so bei Tag und in den
Kleidern mit Wetti gevögelt, hatte als kleiner Bruder vor Rosa stets
einen großen Respekt gehabt, und jetzt lag er da bei ihr im Bett, hielt
ihre harten, kugelförmigen, brennheißen Brüste in der Hand, und sie
spielte mit seinem Schweif.
»Hast du's schon oft mit der Wetti gemacht?« fragte Rosa keuchend.
»Ja«, gestand Schani, »schon oft ...«
»Soll ich's der Mutter erzählen?« drohte sie, und rieb dabei seinen
stehenden Schweif.
»Nein, nix sagen ...«, bat Schani.
Aber Rosa fuhr fort: »Na, jetzt liegst du sogar bei mir im Bett und tust
meine Duteln in die Hand nehmen und spielst mit deiner Nudel bei mir
herum. Wart nur, wenn ich das morgen der Mutter sag' ...«
Schani widersprach ihr: »O nein, das kannst du nicht sagen. Du hast mich
ja gerufen ...«
»An Schmarn hab' ich dich gerufen«, erklärte Rosa, »die Mutter glaubt ja
mir mehr als wie dir. Ich sag' ihr, du bist ins Bett zu mir gekommen und
hast mich vögeln wollen. Und ich sag' ihr, daß du die Wetti gevögelt
hast ...«
Dabei drängte sie sich an ihn an und gab ihm selbst ihre Duteln zum
spielen. Schani wollte fort, aber sie hielt ihn beim Schweif fest.
»Bleib nur da -- du Tschapperl«, meinte sie, »ich sag' ja nix. Fürcht
dich nicht. Ich will ja, daß du mir's auch machst. Komm.«
Schani schwang sich auf sie hinauf. Sie hatte ihm das Hemd in die Höhe
geschoben, daß er ihren ganzen glühenden Körper spürte. Sie spreizte die
Füße auseinander und führte seinen Schweif zu sich. Er spürte voll
Entzücken ihre vollen warmen Schamlippen und den seidenweichen
Haarpolster darüber. Er preßte seinen Schweif in ihre Fut. Rosa half
nach, aber sie war noch eine Jungfrau, und da ging die Sache doch nicht
so einfach. Schani stieß was er konnte, und Rosa stöhnte leise. Endlich
faßte sie ihn mit ausgestreckten Händen beim Popo und preßte sich ihn
bis ganz hinein. Schani spürte, wie ihr Fut langsam auseinanderging, und
es kam ihm auf der Stelle. Auch Rosa war von dem Ergebnis befriedigt und
schickte ihn auf sein Bett zurück. Am nächsten Morgen sah Schani, daß
sein Hemd mit Blut befleckt sei, und Rosa erklärte ihm, das käme von
ihrer Jungfernschaft.
Es dauerte nur kurze Zeit und Wetti entdeckte die nächtlichen Spiele
ihrer Geschwister. Sie schlüpfte zu ihnen, und nun unterhielten sie sich
zu dritt und Schani mußte herhalten. Mochte nun das blasse Aussehen des
Jungen der Mutter aufgefallen sein, oder mochte sie des Nachts etwas
gehört haben, genug sie paßte schärfer auf, und als einmal Schani in
Rosas Bett eingeschlafen war, kam sie herein, weckte die drei und hieß
Schani in sein eigenes Bett gehen.
Am andern Tag in der Früh sagte sie: »Das gehört sich nicht, daß der
Bruder bei den Schwestern schläft.« Rosa fuhr gleich dazwischen und log:
»Der Schani hat sich gefürchtet.« Aber die Mutter erklärte: »Wenn sich
der Bub fürchtet, dann schläft er von heute an bei mir, schon damit mir
das nicht mehr vorkommt, daß er bei seinen Schwestern liegt ...«
Schanis Bett wurde also richtig ins Kabinett gestellt, neben das der
Mutter, so daß er Seite an Seite mit ihr lag. Die Mutter kam nun in der
Nacht zu ihm, drückte ihn an sich, damit er sich nicht fürchten solle.
Sie nahm seine Hände, legte sie sich auf die Brüste, und Schani spielte
damit, bis er einschlief. Diese Brüste waren nicht so voll und rund wie
die seiner Schwestern, aber doch noch fest genug. Das ging so einige
Nächte, bis Schani mutiger wurde, und sich enger an die Mutter
schmiegte, daß sie merkte, wie ihm die Nudel stand. Sie spürte den
harten kleinen Schweif an ihrer Lende und zuckte zurück. Aber sie wühlte
ihm dabei ihre Brüste noch fester in die Hände, und Schani hörte wie sie
keuchte. Wieder vergingen in diesem Spiel ein paar Nächte. Schani schob
seinen Schwanz an den nackten Schenkel. Sie fuhr jedesmal davor zurück,
sagte wohl auch hie und da leise: »Nicht!«, aber sie drängte ihm ihre
Brust auf, so daß seine Erregung immer höher stieg. Nach zehn oder zwölf
Nächten ließ sie seinen Schwanz an ihrem Schenkel liegen, und langsam,
langsam fuhr sie mit der Hand herunter, faßte ihn und streichelte ihn
leise. Endlich warf sie sich auf Schani, nahm seinen Schweif, und auf
ihrem Buben reitend stieß sie sich die Nudel hinein, beugte sich vor,
und preßte ihren Busen an sein Gesicht. »Na, stoß! Stoß!« ächzte sie,
»die Mutter erlaubt's dir! Stoß nur! Fest! Fester!«
Schani erzählte, wie er jede Nacht von da ab seine Mutter gevögelt
hatte. Einmal von unten, dann oben liegend. Manchmal drei- oder viermal,
immer aber mußte er zwei Nummern machen. Bei Tag liefen ihm die
Schwestern nach, die es ja bald belauscht hatten, was im Kabinett der
Mutter vorging und die nun keine Scheu mehr kannten. Es gab keine
Tageszeit, wo er nicht schon eine seiner Schwestern oder die Mutter
hatte vögeln müssen. Keine Stellung, in der er es nicht schon getan
hatte, kein Winkel in der ganzen Wohnung, der nicht schon hatte
herhalten müssen, auf dem Sofa, auf den Sesseln, auf dem Tisch, auf der
Küchenbank, auf dem Fußboden, überall bediente er, in allen Stellungen,
die drei Weiber, von denen jede ihm sofort nach dem Schweif griff, wenn
sie ihn nur allein erwischte. Die beiden Schwestern genierten sich
voreinander längst nicht mehr, weil sie gegen ihre Mutter
zusammenhielten. Waren die beiden Schwestern ohne die Mutter, dann
ließen sie sich von ihrem Bruder vögeln, schauten einander zu und nahmen
seinen Schwanz in den Mund, damit er ohne Pause nach einer Minute wieder
steif werde, ehe sie gestört würden. Auch die Mutter behalf sich mit dem
Schlecken, um seine Leistungsfähigkeit zu erhöhen, trotzdem merkte sie
bald, daß der Schani anderweitig geschwächt werde. Es kam zu einem
Riesenskandal zwischen den drei Weibern, die es aber zuletzt doch für
geraten fanden, sich friedlich in dem Knaben zu teilen. Oft wurde Schani
nun, kaum er bei seiner Mutter gevögelt hatte, zu den Schwestern
gerufen, und die Mutter ließ ihn gehen, oder Rosa oder Wetti erschienen
im Kabinett und holten sich dort gleich ihre Befriedigung, und die
Mutter sah zu, und zwang den Buben dann, wenn er die Runde durch alle
drei Fummeln beendigt hatte zu einem vierten Fick, weil das Zuschauen
sie geil gemacht hatte. Sie hatte nichts mehr dagegen, daß ihre Mädchen
sich an den nächtlichen Orgien beteiligten, nur wenn sie den Buben bei
Tage verbrauchten und ihm seine Kraft für die Nacht nahmen, wurde sie
böse und schlug ihn, sooft sie es entdeckte. -- Schani erzählte mir
diese Dinge und erzürnte sich dabei wegen der »verfluchten drei
Frauenzimmer«, die ihm, wie er mir sagte, alle schon zuwider seien. Ich
hörte ihm begierig zu, und je länger er sprach, desto aufgeregter wurde
ich. Wiederholt machte ich während seiner Erzählung den Versuch, seines
Schwanzes habhaft zu werden, um damit zu spielen, aber er wehrte mich
immer in aller Sanftmut ab. Endlich hob ich meine Röcke, zog seine Hand
herbei, und ließ mir an der Fut von ihm Fingerübungen machen, um doch
beim Zuhören dort einigermaßen beschäftigt zu sein. Es half nichts; denn
Schani sprach und sprach, und seine Finger wurden, wenn er kaum ein
bißchen gespielt hatte, wieder unbeweglich. Ich geriet aber mehr und
mehr in Wollust und Verlangen, und als endlich draußen die Türe geöffnet
ward, und unser Beisammensein unterbrochen wurde, zitterte ich vor
Geilheit und Schrecken.
Es war Herr Ekhard, der nach Hause kam. Kaum erblickte ich ihn, als ich
mein ganzes Verlangen ihm entgegenwarf. Der wird mich jetzt vögeln,
dachte ich, und ich verabschiedete Schani mit solcher Eile, daß er ganz
verwundert darüber war. Dann lief ich eilig in die Küche zu Herrn
Ekhard. Ich hatte lange nichts mit ihm zu tun gehabt, war ihm eher
ausgewichen, und seit mich der Herr Horak im Keller unten gevögelt hatte
und Alois im Schoß seiner Klementine, war mir Herr Ekhard nicht mehr so
wichtig.
In diesem Augenblick aber schaute ich nun wieder nach ihm. Er erschien
mir in meiner momentanen Not wie eine Erlösung. Ich erinnerte mich an
seinen Schweif, und war doch zugleich neugierig, ihn zu sehen. Ich
erinnerte mich gewisser Griffe von seinen Händen, gewisser Liebkosungen,
und dabei dachte ich an Schanis Mutter und Schwestern, die ich nicht
wenig beneidete, weil sie immer eine Nudel hatten, sooft sie sie
wollten. Und ich vergaß völlig, daß ich ja meinen Bruder Franz besaß,
der mich immer, sooft ich es noch verlangt hatte, vögelte. Aber wie lang
war dies nicht geschehen. Ich dachte gar nicht mehr an Franz, er
interessierte mich nicht.
Ich lief also in die Küche, lief direkt auf den Herrn Ekhard zu, und ehe
er noch Zeit hatte, mich zu begrüßen, war ich schon mit der einen Hand
in seinem Hosentürl, wühlte in seinem Hemd nach dem Schwanz, mit der
andern umschlang ich seinen Hals und flüsterte ihm ins Ohr: »Rasch!
Rasch! Es kann wer kommen.«
Herr Ekhard war augenblicklich von meiner Geilheit ergriffen, das fühlte
ich, weil sein Schweif in meiner Hand sich blitzartig aufrichtete, und
in einer Sekunde ganz heiß wurde. Trotzdem fragte er: »Was denn --
rasch? Was willst du denn?«
Ich hatte keine Scheu. Er hatte gefragt, weil er das Wort aus meinem
Mund zu hören wünschte. Ich spürte den geilen Wunsch in seiner Frage,
geriet noch mehr in Aufregung und zögerte nicht: »Vögeln will ich,
schnell vögeln.«
Herr Ekhard zitterte. Er warf sich auf mich, wie ich so vor ihm stand,
und wir wären beide auf die Erde zu liegen gekommen. Aber das wollte ich
nicht. Ich zog ihn ins Zimmer; an seinem Schwanz zog ich ihn nach, und
warf mich dort aufs Bett. Bleischwer sank er auf meine Brust, und sein
Schweif tobte gegen meine Fut. Er hätte mich damals wahrscheinlich ganz
auseinandergesprengt, wenn ich ihn hätte gewähren lassen.
Doch ich fing seinen Schwanz mit der Hand auf, und lenkte ihn. Mit der
rechten Hand bildete ich einen Schlauch, in dem er hin- und herwetzen
konnte, wie in einer Fummel, und nur die Eichel, die lange, spitze
Eichel, die er hatte, ließ ich zu mir ein. Sie spreizte mich ganz, so
dick war sie. Aber sie entfachte mich zum höchsten Genießen: so warm und
gut kam sie zu mir.
Herr Ekhard vollführte so heftige Stöße, daß ich seine Eier gegen meine
Hand, die den Schwanz hielt, anschlagen spürte. Ich war ganz hingerissen
und begriff nicht, wie ich noch einen andern Mann hatte drüber lassen
können als ihn. Und ich kam in Extase: »Vögeln Sie mich nur ...,
gut ..., gut ..., gut ...«, rief ich ihm zu. »Vögeln, pudern, stemmen
Sie mich.« Und dabei fühlte ich in der Hand die Pulse von seiner Nudel,
und fühlte in mir seine Eichel zucken. Ekhard schnaufte besinnungslos,
und auf einmal spürte ich wie eine Sturzwelle seinen Samen sich
ergießen.
Ich hatte ein wenig nur gekostet vom Vergnügen. Genug war mir diese eine
Nummer ganz und gar nicht. Ekhard aber saß erschöpft da und ließ sich
von mir abtrocknen. Ich wollte ihm das beibringen, was ich von Herrn
Horak gelernt hatte. Ich wollte, daß er mich, so tief es ging, in den
Arsch vögeln solle. Deshalb begann ich wieder mit seiner Nudel zu
spielen. Ich nahm sie erst zwischen zwei Finger, wie ich es von
Klementine gesehen hatte und tippte mit dem Zeigefinger an seine
Vorhaut. Und als das nicht viel half, begann ich kurz entschlossen mit
der Schleckerei. Ich nahm den weichen Schwanz ganz in den Mund und warf
ihn darin mit der Zunge hin und her. Mit den Händen wühlte ich
unterdessen in den langen schwarzen Schweifhaaren, die mich in die Augen
kitzelten, oder ich streichelte seine Hoden, und dabei wartete ich voll
Aufregung darauf, daß der Schwanz größer und größer werden solle, was er
denn auch bei so guter Behandlung bald genug tat. Endlich stand er
wieder ganz stramm in der Höhe. Ekhard wollte nach mir greifen, um die
zweite Nummer abzumachen, aber ich umhalste ihn und sagte ihm ins Ohr:
»Wollen Sie ihn nicht tiefer hineinstecken?«
»Ja! Ja!« schnappte er. »Tiefer ... Aber wie denn, es geht ja nicht.«
Und dabei wühlte er mit seinen Händen unter meinen Röcken herum und
stieß mir den Finger so fest in die Fut, daß ich beinahe aufgeschrien
hätte. Ich drängte ihn fort: »So nicht ..., aber es geht ...«
»Wie denn? Wie denn?« wollte er wissen.
Ich kehrte ihm den Rücken zu, bückte mich, und zwischen meine Beine
hindurchlangend schob ich seinen Schweif zu meinem Popo. Herr Ekhard
grunzte wie ein Schwein, während seine von meinem Speichel glitschrig
gemachte Nudel langsam in meinen Hintern eindrang. Immer tiefer und
tiefer bohrte er mich an, viel tiefer, wie mir schien, als es dem Herrn
Horak je gelungen war. Ich fühlte mich so schön ausgefüllt, daß mir
nichts mehr zu wünschen übrigblieb, als wie seine Finger in meiner Fut
kitzeln zu spüren. Und ich holte mir diese Finger. Aber Herr Ekhard war
so wild vor Geilheit, daß er mir meine Spalte blutig gerissen hätte. Ich
zog den Popo zusammen, und Herr Ekhard stöhnte laut auf vor Wonne. Weil
mir das Freude machte, ihn so aufächzen zu hören, zog ich alle
Augenblick den Popo zusammen. Das hatte zur Folge, daß mich früher, als
es mir lieb sein konnte, sein Same durchrieselte.
Ganz erschöpft lehnte er gegen die Wand, indem ich mich wieder
emporrichtete. Aber ich war noch so erfüllt von der Empfindung, seinen
Schwanz bei mir zu haben, daß ich mich vor Wollust schüttelte, und der
Saft, den Herr Ekhard mir gelassen, und der jetzt in dünnen Schnürchen
zum Popo herausgelaufen kam, kitzelte mich.
Ich ließ nicht von ihm ab, und machte mir, unter dem Vorwand, ihn
abzuwischen, wieder an seinem Schweif zu schaffen. Als ich seine Vorhaut
auf und niederzog, sagte er matt: »Geh, laß mich.«
Allein ich hatte noch nicht genug. Mir kam immer Schani, seine Mutter
und seine beiden Schwestern in den Sinn, und ich fragte: »Sagen Sie,
haben Sie schon einmal nackt gevögelt?«
Noch nie hatte ich bis dahin so ungeniert und aufrichtig mit Herrn
Ekhard gesprochen.
Er meinte: »Aber du bist ja selbst schon bei mir im Bett gewesen.«
Worauf ich erwiderte: »Ja, aber ganz nackt, ohne Hemd ...?«
Er fragte: »Hast denn du das schon getan ...?«
»Nein«, sagte ich, »aber ich möcht' es einmal tun. Haben Sie's schon
gemacht?«
Er lächelte: »Natürlich. Ich bin ja verheiratet gewesen.«
»Ist Ihre Frau gestorben?«
»Nein, gestorben ist sie nicht.«
»Wo ist sie denn?«
»Na, eine Hur ist sie geworden.«
Ich erinnerte mich, daß mich der Herr Horak so genannt hatte und fragte:
»Bin ich vielleicht auch eine Hur?«
»O nein«, er lachte heftig über diese Frage. »Du bist meine liebe kleine
Peperl.«
Und dabei drückte er mich an sich, und ich benützte die Gelegenheit,
wieder mit seinem Schweif zu spielen.
»So ein kleines Mädel wie du hab' ich noch nie gefickt«, meinte er,
»schmeckt dir denn das Vögeln so gut ...?«
Ich neigte mich statt aller Antwort herunter und nahm leise seinen
Schwanz in den Mund. Ich leckte mit der Zungenspitze die Eichel, fuhr
den ganzen Schaft herunter, küßte seine Eier und ließ mich von den
Haaren im Gesicht kitzeln. Aber sein Schwanz blieb weich. Ich suzelte
und suzelte, und er sagte nur manchmal: »Das tut wohl ...«
Dann zog er seine Nudel aus meinem Mund und ließ mich zwischen seine
Beine treten. Er hob mir die Röcke auf, und mit der Hand wischte er
seinen schlappen Schweif an meiner Fut herum und kitzelte mich wie mit
einer dicken Zunge.
»Ist das gut?« meinte er.
»Ja, aber warum steht er Ihnen nicht?« gab ich zurück. »Ich möcht', daß
er Ihnen wieder steht ...«
»Wenn das deine Mutter wüßt', was du da tust ...«, sagte er plötzlich.
Ich lachte: »Die Mutter will auch, daß er dem Vater öfter steht ...«
Er wurde aufmerksam: »Woher weißt du das?«
Ich erzählte ihm, während er mit seiner weichen Nudel an meiner Spalte
herumstrich, die nächtliche Szene, die ich belauscht hatte.
Er hörte gespannt zu: »So -- also das hat sie gesagt, daß sie jemanden
andern zum Vögeln finden wird ...?«
Und auf einmal stand ihm der Schweif so fest wie früher. Er hob mich
auf, daß ich mich auf ihn setzen konnte, und so hielt er mich in den
Armen und drückte nun seine Schwanzspitze hinein, so weit er konnte. Ich
tauchte auf und nieder und mir kam es rasch nacheinander, was ich ihm
auch sagte: »Mir kommt's ..., jetzt ..., jetzt ..., nicht so tief, das
tut weh ..., jetzt ..., so ..., so ..., jetzt kommt's schon wieder ...«
Er fragte dazwischen: »Warum will sich deine Mutter nicht von mir vögeln
lassen?«
Ich schob auf der Schwanzspitze hin und her und meinte: »Ich weiß
nicht ...«
Er fuhr fort: »Ich werde deiner Mutter sagen, daß sie's tun soll ...,
ja?«
»Meinetwegen«, gab ich zur Antwort: »... mir kommt's wieder ..., ah ...,
ah ..., das Pudern ist gut ..., gut ..., ist das ...«
Er vögelte mich jetzt wunderbar, aber er dachte nur an das, was ich ihm
erzählt hatte, und ich dachte wieder nur an Schanis Mutter und
Schwestern.
»Glaubst, daß sie sich von mir vögeln läßt?« fragte er keuchend.
»Vielleicht ..., ich weiß nicht ...«, gab ich ihm zur Antwort, und weil
er heftiger zu stoßen begann, bat ich ihn: »nicht so tief ...«
»Bei deiner Mutter ginge er ganz hinein, ... was?«
»Natürlich ...«
»Möchst du's haben, daß ich sie vögel ...?«
Aus Gefälligkeit sagte ich: »Ja ...« Und im selben Moment spritzte er
mich an. Ich fuhr weg von ihm. Aber er war noch nicht fertig und wurde
böse.
»Bleib doch, du Fratz, du dummer ..., es kommt mir erst, sapperment ...,
mitten drin darf man ja nicht fort ...«
Ich wichste ihm den Rest mit der Hand herunter, und es regte mich wieder
auf, wie hoch er spritzte; es wollte gar kein Ende nehmen.
Mittlerweile war es finster geworden. Ich legte mich zu Bett, und Herr
Ekhard tat in der Küche dasselbe. Nach einer Weile aber lief ich zu ihm,
zog das Hemd ab und trat nackt an sein Lager.
Er wollte mich zuerst nicht haben, aber er streichelte mich doch am
ganzen Körper, küßte mich auf die Brustwarzen, was mir sehr wohl tat.
Dann fuhr er mir mit angefeuchteten Fingerspitzen über Brust und Bauch
hinunter in meine Muschel, daß ich ganz außer mir geriet vor Geilheit.
Ich fürchtete, es könne jemand nach Hause kommen, ehe das Spiel zu Ende
gespielt sei, deshalb bat ich ihn: »Gehn S' Herr Ekhard, tummeln Sie
sich, es könnt' wer kommen.«
»Was denn tummeln?« fragte er.
»Mit dem Vögeln ...«, flüsterte ich ihm zu.
»Na hörst du!« Er setzte sich im Bett auf, hielt mich quer auf seinen
Knien, und suchte im Finstern mein Gesicht zu erspähen.
»Na hörst du ..., dreimal hab' ich dir's getan, und jetzt willst du's
wieder ...?«
»Nackt ...«, sagte ich schüchtern.
»Schau dir doch einmal deine Fut an«, meinte er, »die ist ja ganz
ausgewetzt von heut abend ...!«
»O das ist nicht von heute«, entschlüpfte es mir.
»So? Von wann denn?« Er war mit dem Finger in mein Loch geglitten, und
das brachte mich ganz in Aufregung. »So? Von wann ist das denn? Mit wem
vögelst du denn so herum? Na? Mir scheint, du treibst es aber zu viel?
Sag mir mit wem?«
Er bohrte mit seinem Finger an mir herum, und ich war wie von Sinnen.
Trotzdem überlegte ich blitzschnell meine Antwort und beschloß, den
Herrn Horak zu verraten. Das war auch ein Erwachsener.
»Also wer hat das so ausgewetzt?« fragte er tief über mich gebeugt,
heiser vor Neugierde und mit den Fingern in meiner Fut wühlend. »Wer?
Das mußt' mir jetzt sagen ...«
»Der Horak ...«, antwortete ich.
Er wollte alles wissen: »Der Bierversilberer von unten?«
»Ja.«
»Seit wann?«
»Schon lang.«
»Früher als ich dich gevögelt hab'?«
»Nein, später ...«
»Wo denn? Wo hat er dich denn erwischt ...?«
»Im Keller ...«
»Na, und wieso hat er dich so ausgewetzt ...?«
»Weil er so einen langen Schweif hat ...«
»Wie lang? Länger als meiner ...?«
»Ja, viel länger, aber nicht so dick.«
»Und wie oft vögelt er dich auf einmal ...?«
Ich log: »Fünfmal macht er mir's immer ...«
Ekhard war ganz aufgeregt: »Komm«, keuchte er plötzlich, »komm, ich
werd' dich noch einmal pudern.«
Ich schlüpfte unter ihn, er drehte sich vor, hob sich das Hemd auf und
lag nun nackt auf meinem nackten kleinen Körper. Aber es ging nicht.
Sein Schweif war ganz weich und wollte nicht stehen.
»Verflucht«, flüsterte er, »und ich möcht' wirklich ...«
»Ich auch«, gab ich zurück, und bäumte mich ihm entgegen. Aber es half
nichts.
»Weißt was«, meinte er, »nimm ihn wieder in den Mund, da steht er
gleich ...«
Ich versuchte noch immer mit der Hand da unten nachzuhelfen und mir den
weichen Zumpel hereinzustopfen. Aber er wiederholte: »Nimm ihn wieder in
'n Mund ..., den Horak seinen wirst ja auch suzeln, was?«
»Ja ...«, gestand ich.
Ekhard rutschte an mir herauf, und als ich verstand, was er wollte,
rutschte ich im Bett tiefer, bis er, immer auf mir liegend, seinen
Schwanz an meine Lippen brachte. So machte ich wieder, und in dieser
Stellung besonders deutlich, meinen Mund zur Fut. Denn Ekhard schob mir
seine Nudel ganz in die Lippen. Sein Bauch lag auf meinem Gesicht, daß
ich kaum Luft bekam. Dennoch arbeitete ich, wie ich nur konnte, weil die
Angst, von meinen heimkehrenden Leuten gestört zu werden, mich peinigte.
Er hatte seinen Kopf in den Polster vergraben, stöhnte leise und hob
sein Gesäß, als ob er vögeln würde. Ich lag unter ihm und sog und
schleckte und züngelte an seinem Schweif, der mir im Mund hin- und
herging. Das dauerte eine ganze Weile. Der Schweiß brach mir aus, und
die Lippen schmerzten mich. Endlich, endlich fühlte ich den Speer sich
aufrichten, fühlte ihn rund, steif, hart, groß werden. Endlich ging er
nicht mehr ganz in meinen Mund hinein, endlich spürte ich, wie er zu
pulsieren begann.
Wie eine Eidechse glitt ich unter Ekhard höher, bis der warme Stiel
zwischen meinen Beinen lag. Dort haschte ich ihn mit den Händen und
vergrub ihn in meine Fut, so weit er nur darin Platz hatte. Das draußen
bleibende Stück, es war der größere Teil, hielt ich in beiden Händen
sanft umklammert und freute mich, wie er hin und herging.
Ekhard vögelte mich mit einer wahren Wut: »Das hätt' ich nicht
geglaubt«, schnaufte er, »das hätt' ich nicht geglaubt, daß wir noch
eine Nummer machen.«
»Besser stoßen«, bat ich, »besser stoßen.«
»Na wart«, raunte er mir zu, »ich will dich ficken, daß du die Engel
singen hörst ..., na wart ...«
Er legte mir die Hände auf die Brust und spielte mit nassen
Fingerspitzen an meinen Brustwarzen, daß mir wonnige Schauer bis in die
Fußsohlen herunter liefen.
Ich warf meine Fut seinem Schweif entgegen, ließ mit den Händen ein
bißchen nach, und fühlte wie er tiefer eindrang.
»Wart«, sagte er jetzt, »du Hur, du nichtsnutzige, du Fratz, du geiler,
du Petschiermädel, du läufiges, wart nur du Hure du, ich werd's dir
zeigen ...«
Und er preßte seinen Mund an mein Ohr und begann mir die Ohrmuschel
auszuschlecken. Im selben Moment war mir, als ob ich losschreien müßte.
Mir war, als ob er mit sechs Schwänzen mich vögeln würde, in der Fut, im
Mund, in den beiden Ohren, und auf den beiden Brustwarzen. Ich hielt das
laute Schreien mit Mühe zurück, aber reden mußte ich: »Jessas, Herr
Ekhard ..., das ist gut ..., das ist gut ..., ich werd' mich immer nur
von Ihnen vögeln lassen ..., immer nur von Ihnen ..., Jessas mir
kommt's ..., mir kommt's ..., ganz tief herein ..., so ...« Ich ließ ihn
wieder ein Stückchen mehr zu mir, es tat schon weh, aber ich achtete
nicht darauf.
»Wart nur«, flüsterte Ekhard an meinem Ohr, indem er zwischen seinen
Worten mit der Zunge in meiner Ohrmuschel herumfuhr: »Wart nur, dir
werd' ich das Pudern beibringen ..., du wirst mir nicht mehr in Keller
gehen ..., mit dem Bierversilberer auf'n Faßl pudern ..., wart nur ...,
dich vögel' ich jetzt, wie ich meine Frau gevögelt hab' ..., so ...,
so ..., und wenn du gleich ein Kind kriegst ..., das geniert mich
nicht ..., stoß nur zu ..., so ..., mir entgegenstoßen ..., was?
G'spürst es ..., ja?«
Ich war so aufgelöst, daß ich immerfort sprach und ihm Antwort gab:
»Nein, Herr Ekhard ..., nein ..., ich geh' nicht mehr in' Keller ...,
ich lass' mich nicht ... mehr von Horak vögeln ... nein ..., von niemand
mehr, ... nur von Ihnen ..., von Ihnen ganz allein, ... von Alois nicht
mehr ..., und nicht mehr vom Franzl ..., und von Robert nicht mehr, ...
und von kein Soldaten auch nicht mehr, ... nur von Ihnen ...!«
»So viel Schwänze hast du schon drin gehabt ...?«
»Ja«, sagte ich, »so viel Schwänze ..., und noch viel mehr ..., noch ein
Haufen anderer Buben ...«
Er vögelte drauf los wie im Sturm. »Alsdann brauch' ich mich nicht
genieren ..., mich wirst nicht verraten.«
»Nein, Herr Ekhard«, stammelte ich in Ekstase ..., »Ihnen nicht! Aber
Sie müssen mich alle Tag so vögeln ..., ah so gut ..., so gut ist der
Schwanz in der Fut ..., ah, es kommt mir schon wieder ..., es kommt
mir ..., nur so weiter stoßen ..., nur so weiter ..., nur fest ...«
»Wann was g'schieht«, sagte er, »dann sagst du, daß es der Horak
war ..., verstehst ...?«
»Ja, aber Sie müssen mich alle Tag vögeln ..., alle Tag ..., ah ...,
ah ...«
»Mein' letzten Baaz geb ich her«, rief er, »soll sein was will, ich
werd' dich schon so ausvögeln, daß der Schweif noch ganz hineingeht ...«
Und dann remmelten wir wortlos weiter im Takt. Meine Hände brannten,
meine Fut brannte, meine Ohren sausten, mein Atem versagte. Ekhard
puderte weiter wie eine Maschine.
Mehr als eine Stunde dauerte diese Nummer. Ich rührte mich nicht mehr,
und hie und da wagte ich die Frage: »Noch nicht bald fertig ...?«
»Nein ...«, keuchte er.
Und weiter remmelte sein Schweif. In mir war alles vorbei. Die letzten
Male, da es mir noch gekommen war, hatte ich eher Schmerz als Wonne
gefühlt. Es hatte nur flüchtig in mir gezuckt, und wie ein rascher
Krampf war es mir in die Zehenspitzen gefahren und hatte mich gestreckt.
Dann aber spürte ich nur den Brand meiner halb wund geriebenen Haut.
»Noch nicht ...?«
»Bald.«
Nach einer Weile: »Bitt schön, Herr Ekhard, es tut mir schon weh.«
»Gleich, mein Mauserl ..., kommt's dir nicht noch einmal?«
»Nein ..., es kommt mir gar nicht mehr.... Bitt schön, spritzen Sie Herr
Ekhard ..., spritzen Sie ...«
Er machte einen solchen Stoß, daß ich glaubte, er sprenge mir die Fut
auseinander. Und dann begann er zu spritzen. Es rann mir so in meine
Spalte hinein und quietschend wieder heraus, als ob er uriniere. Das
ganze Bett war naß, so floß der Samen aus seiner Röhre. Dabei lag er
ganz still und wie ein Klotz so schwer auf mir und röchelte.
Ich wand mich, als er fertig war, unter ihm hervor, halbtot vor
Müdigkeit. Er stieß nach mir und brummte: »Schau aber jetzt, daß du
weiterkommst, du Hurenfratz du vermaledeiter ...«
Ich gab ihm gar keine Antwort, sondern trat nackt wie ich war ins
Zimmer, zog das Hemd an und warf mich auf mein Bett. Mir brannte meine
Muschel inwendig und an ihren äußeren Rändern wie Feuer. Ich glaubte,
ich müsse voll Wunden sein, zündete ein Licht an und besah mich mittels
eines Handspiegels. Wund oder blutig war ich allerdings nicht, aber ich
erschrak doch, wie rot die Fut war, wie weit sie klaffte und wie weh mir
alles tat.
Ich legte mich hin, blies das Licht aus. Zwei Minuten später kamen meine
Leute. Ich tat als ob ich schliefe, verbiß meinen Hunger, indessen sie
ihr Nachtmahl verzehrten, und später schlief ich wirklich ein.
Am nächsten Morgen war Herr Ekhard krank. Er lag in der Küche im Bett,
legte sich kalte Umschläge auf den Kopf, und wie ich glaube auch
anderswohin. Ich war ganz wohl, nur die Fut brannte mich noch ein wenig.
Ekhard sah mich nicht an, und auch ich vermied es, mit ihm zu reden. Er
schlief übrigens beinahe den ganzen Tag. Als ich abends bei ihm
vorbeiging, zischelte er mir zu: »Da bist du schuld!«
Ich bekam eine plötzliche Angst und lief ins Zimmer, wo meine Mutter
war, und es gab mir keine Ruhe, ich mußte sie fragen: »Was fehlt denn
dem Herrn Ekhard?«
»Ich weiß nicht«, erwiderte sie gleichgültig, »krank ist er halt.«
Wenige Minuten später ging sie in die Küche, und ich hörte sie fragen:
»Was fehlt Ihnen denn eigentlich, Herr Ekhard ...?«
Ich erschrak furchtbar, weil ich nicht anders meinte, als daß er jetzt
sagen werde, »die Pepi ist dran schuld ...«
Er flüsterte etwas, das ich nicht verstand, und ich vernahm nur, wie die
Mutter sagte: »Gehn S', hören S' auf.«
Vorsichtig schlich ich zur Tür, um zu horchen. Ich mußte, koste es was
es wolle, ich mußte hören, was vorging.
Ekhard flüsterte in seinem Baß, und die Mutter sagte auch schon leiser:
»Aber warum tun S' denn so was?«
Er antwortete flüsternd: »Das Madl hat mich so aufgeregt, sag' ich
Ihnen, ich bin ein ganzer Narr g'wesen ...«
Ich war vor Angst mehr tot als lebendig.
Meine Mutter sagte: »Das muß aber ein sauberes Luder g'wesen sein ...«
Ekhard widersprach: »Nein, nein, sie ist noch ein Kind, die weiß ja
selbst nicht, was sie anstellt, die ist vielleicht so alt wie Ihre
Pepi ...«
Jetzt atmete ich auf.
Aber meine Mutter schlug die Hände zusammen: »Und da traun Sie sich und
tun so ein Kind schänden ...«
Ekhard lachte: »Ach was, schänden! Schänden! Wenn sie mir selber den
Schwanz aus dem Hosentürl herausnimmt, wenn sie selber mir die Nudel in'
Mund nimmt und abschleckt, dann werd' ich sie wohl nicht geschändet
haben.«
Meine Mutter war entsetzt: »Nein, wie die Kinder schlecht sind ..., da
sieht man, man kann nicht genug aufpassen.«
Dann senkte sie ihre Stimme völlig zum Flüstern herab, und ich entnahm
nur aus seiner Antwort, was sie gefragt haben mochte. Herr Ekhard wurde
lebhafter und meinte: »Aber nein, wo wird er denn ganz hereingehen ...
Nur so weit, nur so ein Stückerl, ... geben S' die Hand her, ich zeig's
Ihnen ...«
»Nein, nein, ich dank' schön ..., was fällt Ihnen denn ein?«
»Na, da wär' auch nix dabei«, meinte Herr Ekhard.
Die Mutter unterbrach ihn: »Wie oft ham S' g'sagt?«
»Sechsmal ...« Herr Ekhard log und es machte mir Spaß, daß ich es wußte
und daß die Mutter keine Ahnung davon hatte. »Sechsmal hab' ich's
petschieren müssen«, fuhr er fort, »die hat's nicht anders getan ...« --
»Gehn S' mir weg ...«, fiel meine Mutter ein. »Das gibt's ja gar nicht,
sechsmal ... Was lügen S' denn so daher ...«
»Wenn ich Ihnen aber sag'«, beteuerte Ekhard, »Sie sehen doch, daß ich
mich nicht rühren kann. Sechsmal ...«
»Ah nein!« Meine Mutter glaubte ihm nicht, »das bringt ja gar kein Mann
zusammen ...«
»Hören S' Frau Mutzenbacher«, sagte Ekhard lachend, »hat Ihr Mann noch
nie sechs Nummern g'macht auf Ihnen?«
Meine Mutter kicherte: »Ja, freilich was denn ...?«
In diesem Augenblick kam jemand. Das Gespräch war zu Ende, und ich
fühlte mich von jeder Angst befreit.
Auch die nächsten Tage war Herr Ekhard noch krank, wie er sagte. Er lag
freilich nicht mehr zu Bett, aber er ging in Unterhosen und Pantoffeln
im Haus herum, saß bei der Mutter in der Küche, und oft merkte ich, daß
sie noch von der Sache sprachen.
Am dritten oder vierten Tag, ich war schon um zehn Uhr von der Schule
frei, kam ich am Vormittag nach Hause. Die Küche war leer; die Glastür,
die in das Zimmer führte und mit einer weißen Spitzengardine verhängt
war, geschlossen. Ich sah gleich, daß die Mutter mit dem Herrn Ekhard im
Zimmer war. Und da sie mich nicht hörten, verhielt ich mich still und
trachtete ihr Gespräch zu erlauschen, weil ich dachte, es werde wieder
von mir die Rede sein.
Ich hörte, wie meine Mutter sagte: »Nix ham S' g'hört, eine Lug ist das
von Ihnen ...« Ekhard entgegnete: »Aber erinnern S' sich nur, es wird
schon stimmen ..., ich hab' ganz genau g'hört, wie Sie g'sagt haben, es
is Ihnen noch nicht gekommen, und wie Sie von Ihrem Mann verlangt haben,
er soll noch eine zweite Nummer machen.«
Die Mutter lachte: »Ja, von dem eine zweite Nummer ..., da muß man froh
sein, wenn er eine zusammenbringt ...«
»Na sehen Sie«, meinte Ekhard eifrig, »er wird halt früher fertig wie
Sie, weil er zu viel Schwäche hat ...«
Die Mutter antwortete mürrisch: »Andere Männer werden auch nicht viel
besser sein.«
»Oho, da täuschen Sie sich aber recht sehr«, widersprach ihr Ekhard,
»ich kann's so lang zurückhalten wie ich will, und wenn Sie es sich
dreimal wollen kommen lassen, liegt mir auch nix dran.«
Die Mutter lachte: »Das kann ein jeder sagen. Das glaub' ich nicht ...,
Sie tun sich nur prahlen ...«
»Was prahlen ...? Was prahlen ...?« Herr Ekhard trat ganz nah zu meiner
Mutter. »Geben Sie's her einmal ..., dann werden Sie schon sehen ...«
Die Mutter schüttelte den Kopf: »Aber nein, das wissen Sie schon, das
tu' ich nicht.«
Ekhard erwischte sie bei den Hüften: »Na gehen S', jetzt wär' ich grad
aufgelegt, ein paar Nummern zu machen ...«
Er rang mit ihr, die sich sträubte: »Lassen S' mich los, Herr Ekhard,
ich schrei' ...«
Ekhard ließ sie los, blieb aber dicht bei ihr und flüsterte: »Gehn S'
Frau Mutzenbacher, lassen S' mich drüber, Sie g'fallen mir schon lang.«
Die Mutter trat von ihm fort und schüttelte heftig den Kopf: »Geben Sie
mir an Ruh -- ich bin eine anständige Frau, verstehen Sie?«
Meine Mutter war eine schlanke, aber festgebaute Frau, und mochte damals
sechsunddreißig oder achtunddreißig Jahre alt sein. Sie hatte noch ein
frisches Gesicht und schöne blonde Haare.
»Hören Sie«, sagte Ekhard, »Ihnen möcht' man's aber nicht ankennen, daß
Sie schon drei Kinder g'habt haben ...« Meine Mutter schwieg, und er
fuhr fort: »Das heißt nämlich, im Gesicht merkt man's nicht ...,
anderswo wird man's schon merken ...«
»Nirgends merkt man was«, rief die Mutter eifrig, »ich bin noch ganz so,
wie ich als Mädchen war.«
Jetzt spielte Ekhard den Ungläubigen: »Gehn S' weiter ..., bei die
G'spaßlaberln wird man's schon kennen.«
Die Mutter war ganz beleidigt: »Nix kennt man. Meine Brust ist noch grad
so wie sie war.«
Ekhard sprang zu ihr und wollte sie bei den Brüsten packen: »Das muß ich
selber sehen«, rief er.
Aber die Mutter entzog sich ihm: »Lassen Sie's bleiben, wenn Sie's nicht
glauben wollen.«
Dennoch gelang es Ekhard, eine Brust zu erwischen. Ich sah, wie er sie
faßte und zusammendrückte. Und er war außer sich vor Freude: »Nein, so
was! Nein, so was!« rief er ein- ums anderemal. »Das ist ja wie bei
einer Jungfrau ..., hören Sie, das ist mir mein Leben noch nicht
vorgekommen.«
Die Mutter wehrte sich noch ein wenig, dann aber hielt sie still und
lächelte stolz: »Na sehen Sie«, sagte sie, »jetzt glauben Sie's mir.«
»Meiner Seel, jetzt glaub ich's«, erwiderte Ekhard und nahm die zweite
Brust in die Hand, ohne daß meine Mutter es ihm verwehrte.
»Wissen Sie«, fuhr er fort und dabei spielte er mit beiden Händen an den
beiden Brüsten, so daß man durch die dünne Perkailbluse die Warzen
hervortreten sah, »wissen Sie, Sie sind schön dumm, daß Sie mit so einer
schönen Brust noch sich anstrengen, damit's Ihnen einmal kommt, bei
Ihrem Mann. Da möchten andere sich das Beuschel herausvögeln, nur wegen
dieser Duterln da ...«
»Ich bin halt eine brave Frau«, sagte die Mutter, aber sie stand ruhig
und ließ mit ihren Brüsten spielen.
»Brav hin, brav her«, redete ihr Ekhard zu, »wenn der Mann nix hergibt,
hört sich die Bravheit auf. Da haben Sie keine Verpflichtung mehr. Die
Natur will befriedigt sein ...«
Mit diesen Worten hatte er die Bluse aufgeknöpft und nahm jetzt die
nackten Brüste aus dem Hemd. Sie lagen weiß in seinen braunen Händen.
»Gehn S', hören S' auf«, flüsterte meine Mutter und suchte sich frei zu
machen. Aber er bückte sich rasch und küßte sie auf die linke
Brustwarze. Ich sah, wie meine Mutter am ganzen Körper erbebte. »Hören
S' auf ...! Hören S' auf!« flüsterte sie eindringlich. Und dann setzte
sie hinzu: »Es könnt' wer kommen ...« Sie stand vor den Doppelbetten,
die noch von der vergangenen Nacht nicht aufgeräumt waren. Ekhard warf
sie mit einem plötzlichen Stoß quer auf die Betten und lag gleich darauf
zwischen ihren Beinen.
Sie strampelte mit den Beinen, und Ekhard hatte viel Mühe, sie
niederzuhalten.
»Nein, nein ...«, flüsterte sie, »ich will nicht ..., ich will
nicht ..., ich bin eine brave Frau ...«
»Ach was«, herrschte sie Ekhard an, »Sie wer'n schon einmal ein' andere
Nudel g'nommen haben.«
»Nein, noch nie ... noch nie ... Gehn Sie weg ..., oder ich schrei ...«
Ekhard suchte schon den Eingang mit seinem Schweif. »Machen S' keine
G'schichten, wegen ein' Mal ...«, keuchte er. Dabei sah ich von der
Seite, wie er die Brüste streichelte und drückte.
»Wenn jetzt wer kommt ...«, bat ihn die Mutter.
»Es kommt niemand«, beruhigte er sie und begann schon mit seinen
heftigen Vögelstößen. Die Mutter lag ruhig da und regte sich kaum. Sie
sagte nur immer: »Ich bitt' Sie, tun Sie's nicht ..., bitt' Sie ...,
nicht ...« Auf einmal lachte sie: »Sie finden ja gar nicht hin ...«
Ekhard stieß auf ihr herum. Und plötzlich hörte ich sie flüstern:
»Warten Sie ..., nicht ..., nicht ...«, ein kurzes Stöhnen kam, ein
langer Seufzer. Ekhard hatte ihr den Schweif hineingestoßen.
Im Augenblick war alles verändert. Sie wurde von einem Beben am ganzen
Körper geschüttelt, dann breitete sie die Füße weit auseinander und
Ekhard nahm sie, und legte sie sich auf beide Arme: »So«, flüsterte er,
»so, Weiberl.«
Ich kannte seine taktmäßigen Stöße und sah, daß er jetzt mit voller Lust
drauf losvögelte, und ich überlegte, ob ich dableiben und zuschauen oder
hinuntergehen und im Keller den Herrn Horak suchen sollte. Aber ich
fürchtete, die beiden könnten mich hören, wenn ich mich rührte und dann
bannte mich doch die Neugierde an meinen Platz.
Meine Mutter begann die Stöße Ekhards zu erwidern: »Ah«, rief er, »du
kannst es aber ..., du kannst es ..., ah ..., so eine warme enge
Fut ..., und so schöne Duterln ..., ah ..., und so gut zurückstoßen tust
du ..., ah ..., da lass ich mir's gar nicht kommen ..., da bleib' ich
immer drin ...«
Die Mutter atmete immer schwerer und immer schneller, dann brach auch
sie endlich mit ihren Reden los: »Maria und Josef ..., du tust mir
weh ..., so ein Schwanz so ein großer ..., und so dick ..., ah ...,
süß ..., süß ..., ah ..., ah ..., das ist ganz anders als wie sonst ...,
fest nur fest ..., das g'spür ich bis in die Duteln herauf ..., vögel
mich ..., vögel mich gut ... Gleich kommt's mir.«
»Laß dir nur Zeit«, meinte Ekhard, der sich wie ein Drescher auf und
nieder bewegte: »Laß dir nur Zeit ..., ich spritz' nicht ...«
»Ah, das ist gut ..., das kenn' ich noch gar nicht, wenn man so ruhig
sich ausvögeln darf«, flüsterte sie. »Mein Mann wär jetzt schon längst
fertig ..., ah ..., so ist's gut ..., so fest hinein ..., fest ..., und
remmel ..., ah ... das ist wunderbar ..., so lang hat's mein Mann noch
nie gemacht ...«
»Jetzt wär das Herausziehen unangenehm?« fragte Ekhard. Dabei zog er
sich ein wenig zurück.
Meine Mutter schrie laut auf, umklammerte ihn, und wie er wieder
hineinfuhr, schrie sie noch einmal: »Ah ..., Gott ..., mir kommt's, ...
mir kommt's ..., um Gottes willen nur jetzt nicht fort ..., nur jetzt
nicht ..., bitte ..., bitte, bitte, bitte ...«
Ekhard flog nur so hin und her. »Was, jetzt darf ich auf einmal vögeln,
nicht wahr? Jetzt darf ich? Gelt ja? Und zuerst hast mich nicht drüber
lassen wollen ...«
»Puder mich nur ... Ach Gott, wenn ich das gewußt hätt', wie gut das
ist, wie gut der Schwanz ist und wie der remmeln kann ..., ach ...,
ach ..., jetzt ..., jetzt ..., jetzt ...«
Sie brach in ein Weinen, Quetschen und Schluchzen aus, und jappte nach
Atem. Ekhard vögelte weiter.
Meine Mutter sagte: »Mir ist's schon gekommen ...«
»Macht nichts«, unterbrach er sie, »wird's dir halt noch einmal kommen.«
Und er stieß mit unverminderter Kraft drauf los.
»Noch! Es kommt mir wirklich schon wieder ..., hah! Das hat's bei meinem
Mann nie gegeben ..., oh ..., ich sterbe ..., ich sterbe ..., ich spür'
den Schwanz bis zum Mund herauf, bitt' dich ..., nimm die Duteln ...,
spiel mit meiner Brust, bitte spiel mit den Duteln ..., so ..., so ...,
und vögel mich nur immer weiter ...«
Ekhard gab sich noch mehr Mühe: »Jetzt darf ich halt mit den Duterln
spielen, was?« fragte er flüsternd, »jetzt heißt's nicht mehr, `ich bin
eine brave Frau´, was ..., mit der Nudel in der Fut hören sich die
Dummheiten auf ...«
Sie antwortete glücklich: »Ja, laß sie nur in der Fut, deine Nudel ...,
laß sie nur ..., ah mir kommt's schon wieder, zum drittenmal, ... ach
was ..., brave Frau ..., ach was ..., mir kommt's ..., brave Frau ...,
vögel mich, vögel mich ..., und wenn auch wer kommt, mir liegt gar nix
dran ...«
Ekhard wütete auf ihr. Er riß an ihren Brüsten, hob ihre Beine hoch, und
indem hörte ich das Röcheln, das ich kannte: »Jetzt, ... jetzt spritz
ich ..., jetzt ...«
»Spritz nur, spritz!« Mit Entzücken empfing die Mutter seinen Samen.
»Ach ..., jetzt ..., jetzt spür' ich's ..., jetzt ..., wie er
spritzt ..., ganz warm kommt's zu mir herein ..., ach und wie oft daß er
zuckt ..., ach das ist ein Schwanz, das ist ein Schwanz ..., hihi die
Duteln, nimm sie ..., so ..., mir kommt's auch ..., ich werd' gewiß ein
Kind kriegen ..., so viel spritzen tut's ..., macht nix ..., und wie er
noch stößt ..., wenn mein Mann spritzen tut, rührt er sich nimmer ...,
und du vögelst noch so gut dabei ..., so ... so ..., und mein Mann
spritzt zweimal und dann ist's vorbei ..., ah ..., ah ..., ah ...«
Sie lagen alle beide ganz still aufeinander. Es war vorüber.
Dann erhob sich Ekhard und meine Mutter setzte sich auf. Ihr Haar hatte
sich aufgelöst, ihre Brüste standen frei und nackt hervor. Ihre Röcke
waren noch verschoben. Sie hielt sich die Hände vor das Gesicht, schaute
aber durch die gespreizten Finger zu Ekhard auf und lächelte.
Er griff nach ihren Händen, zog sie ihr vom Gesicht fort. »Ich schäm'
mich«, sagte sie.
»Ach nix!« tat er sie ab. »Jetzt ist schon alles eins.«
»Mein Schwanz, mein guter!« sagte sie, hielt seinen Schweif in ihrer
Hand und betrachtete ihn neugierig. »Nein, so ein schöner Schweif ...,
mir ist noch immer als ob er drin stecken würde.«
Dann beugte sie sich herab und nahm die ganze, rote, dicke Nudel
Ekhards, die halb weich war, auf einmal in den Mund. Sofort stand die
Geschichte so fest wie früher.
»Komm ..., vögeln.« Ekhard zog den Schweif aus dem Mund der Mutter, und
wollte sie wieder aufs Bett werfen.
»Nein ...«, rief sie erstaunt, »noch einmal? ... Du kannst es wirklich
noch einmal?«
»Da ist doch nichts dabei ...«, sagte er. »Natürlich ... noch
fünfmal ..., wenn niemand kommt ...«
»Wenn nur niemand kommen möcht'«, rief die Mutter, »ich weiß nicht, ich
bin ganz verrückt ..., ich halt's nicht aus ...«
»Am besten«, meinte Ekhard, »am besten ist's für den Fall, daß jemand
käm', wir legen uns gar nicht nieder ..., setzen wir uns daher.« Er
setzte sich auf einen Sessel, und aus seiner schwarzen Hose stand sein
roter Schweif hoch empor. Vorsichtig bestieg die Mutter diesen Sattel,
und ich sah, wie sie selbst mit ihrer Hand herunter griff, und sich den
Stift befestigte. Gleich darauf hüpfte sie wie rasend auf und nieder: »O
Gott, o Gott, so ist's noch besser, so ist's noch viel besser ..., o
Gott, o Gott ..., da tupft mich der Schwanz direkt am Herzen ...«
Ekhard brummte: »Siehst du, wärst nicht immer so stolz gewesen, hätten
wir schon lang vögeln können ...«
Die Mutter rief: »Halt mich bei den Duteln, daß ich dich überall
hab' ..., halt mich ..., ach Gott ..., ach Gott ..., jetzt bin ich
fünfzehn Jahr verheiratet ..., und nie hab' ich so gevögelt ...,
nein ..., so ein Mann verdient's nicht ..., ach Gott, ach Gott ..., daß
man brav bleibt.«
Ihre Brüste flogen bei ihrem Tanz auf und nieder. Jetzt griff Ekhard
danach und hielt sie fest. Und bald auf die eine, bald auf die andere
Warze drückte er schmatzende, saugende Küsse.
»Mir kommt's ..., immerfort kommt's mir ..., alle Augenblick rinnt mir
die Natur heraus ..., ach du guter Mann ..., du kannst es, was ...? Mir
kommt's schon wieder ..., schon wieder ...«
Es währte nicht lange und Ekhard begann wieder sein Röcheln. Dann sah
ich, wie er mit seinen letzten Stößen die Mutter hoch emporhob, die
Brüste, die er dabei festhielt, wurden ganz lang ausgezogen, aber das
spürte sie nicht. Sie hielt sich jetzt bewegungslos und ließ sich den
spritzenden Schaft in den Leib bohren. Aber ich konnte wahrnehmen, wie
ihr ganzer Körper dabei zitterte, und sie hatte alle Worte verloren,
sondern wimmerte nur noch leise. Dann lag sie in seinen Armen eine Weile
wie tot. Endlich standen beide auf, und die Mutter kniete vor Ekhard
hin, nahm seinen Schweif in den Mund und fing an wie rasend daran zu
saugen und zu lecken.
Er sagte, während es ihn beutelte: »Na, werden wir jetzt öfter beisammen
sein ...?«
Sie hielt inne und meinte: »Ich bin Vormittag immer allein, das weißt du
ja ...«
Ekhard schüttelte den Kopf: »Ich muß aber morgen schon wieder ins
G'schäft ...«
Die Mutter fand gleich einen Ausweg: »Dann komm ich halt in der Nacht zu
dir, wenn mein Mann im Wirtshaus ist ...«
»Und die Kinder ...?«
»Ah was«, gab sie zurück, »die Kinder schlafen ...«
Ekhard dachte wohl an mich und sagte skeptisch: »Das ist doch nicht so
gewiß, daß die Kinder schlafen ...«
»Aber ja«, beteuerte die Mutter, »die hören nie was ..., vögelt doch
mich mein Mann auch immer, wenn sie schlafen, und sie hören nie was ...«
Wieder mußte Ekhard wohl an mich denken. »Soo? Na, mir ist's recht«,
meinte er.
Währenddessen hatte die Mutter immer seinen Schweif im Mund gehabt, und
ihn nur herausgezogen, wenn sie sprach. Jetzt sagte Ekhard: »Machen wir
g'schwind noch eine Nummer ..., bevor wer kommt ...«
Die Mutter sprang auf: »Nein, so was ..., so was ..., aber
g'schwind ...«, nur einmal lass' ich mir's noch kommen ..., aber nur
sehr g'schwind ...«
Sie warf sich mit dem Rücken aufs Bett und hob ihre Röcke.
»Nein«, sagte er, »dreh dich um.«
Er richtete sie so, daß sie vor dem Bett stehend, mit dem Kopf auf dem
Leintuch sich stützte, und ihren Popo in die Höhe streckte. Dann rannte
er ihr seinen Speer von hinten hinein. Sie ließ nur ein tiefes Gurgeln
hören, und gleich darauf seufzte sie: »Mir kommt's ..., schon ...,
jetzt ..., bitt' dich spritz du auch ..., spritz ...«
Ekhard flüsterte ihr zu: »Jetzt spritz' ich, schad' ..., daß ich deine
Duteln ..., nicht angreifen kann ..., so ..., jetzt spritz' ich ...,
ah ..., ah ...«
Er zog seinen Schwanz gleich heraus, wischte ihn ab und knöpfte die Hose
zu. Dann setzte er sich auf einen Sessel und trocknete sich den Schweiß
von der Stirne.
Die Mutter nahm das Lavoir vom Waschtisch, stellte es auf den Boden,
hockte sich darüber und begann sich die Fut zu waschen. Wie sie damit
fertig war, ging sie zu Ekhard. Ihre Brüste hingen noch heraus. Sie
reichte ihm eine nach der anderen zum Mund hin: »Noch ein Bussel«,
verlangte sie und Ekhard nahm nacheinander ihre beiden Warzen in den
Mund und küßte sie. Dann schloß die Mutter ihre Bluse.
»Vielleicht komm' ich schon heut abend in die Küche hinaus ...«, sagte
sie.
Ekhard meinte: »Na schön, wird mich freuen.«
Die Mutter fing plötzlich von mir an, freilich, ohne zu wissen, daß sie
von mir rede: »Na, und was ist denn mit dem kleinen Luder, mit der du
sechs Nummern gemacht hast ...?«
Ekhard erwiderte: »Was soll denn mit ihr sein ...?«
»Wirst du sie vielleicht jetzt auch noch vögeln ...?«
»Die ...?« Ekhard lächelte. »Bist du eifersüchtig ...?«
»Ja«, sagte die Mutter energisch, »ich will, daß du nur mich
vögelst ..., nur mich, ganz allein ...«
»Aber du laßt dich doch auch von einem andern vögeln ...«
Sie war erstaunt: »Ich ...? Von wem denn?«
»Na, von deinem Mann doch ..., nicht?«
»Oh, von dem ..., den lass' ich jetzt gar nicht mehr drüber ...«
»Das gibt's doch nicht, der wird dich doch pudern wollen ...«
»Na«, meinte sie zögernd, »der tut's ja doch nur alle zwei, drei Wochen
einmal, und das kann dich ja nicht genieren ... Der steckt ihn ein
bisserl herein, fahrt zweimal hin und her und ist gleich wieder
fertig ...«
»So«, sagte Ekhard, »und ich werd' mein Mäderl alle zwei, drei Wochen
einmal pudern, ich steck' ihr ihn ja auch nicht ganz hinein, und so sind
wir quitt.«
»Ich bitt' dich«, warnte sie ihn, »gib nur Acht. Du kannst amal erwischt
werden und dann kommst ins Landesgericht ...«
Ekhard lachte: »Nein, nein, mich erwischen s' nicht. Und du wirst
deswegen auch nicht zu kurz kommen, wenn ich das Mädel auch einmal
hernehm und petschier sie ...«
»Geh jetzt hinaus«, sagte die Mutter, »es ist eben bald z' Mittag, und
es könnt leicht wer kommen ...«
Sie umarmten sich noch einmal. Ekhard mit beiden Händen an den Brüsten
der Mutter, sie mit der Hand an seinem Hosentürl. Dann kam Ekhard
heraus.
Als er mich erblickte, erschrak er im ersten Moment.
Ich lächelte ihn verschmitzt an, und er war einige Sekunden lang so
verlegen, daß er nicht reden konnte. Dann kam er zu mir und flüsterte:
»Hast du was gesehn?« Ich lächelte weiter, statt jeder Antwort. Er fuhr
mir mit der Hand unter die Röcke und an meiner Fut spielend meinte er:
»Du wirst niemandem was sagen ..., nicht wahr ...?« Ich nickte nur, und
er ließ von mir ab, weil er fürchtete, die Mutter könne herauskommen.
Seither habe ich ein paarmal belauscht, daß die Mutter abends, wenn der
Vater noch im Wirtshaus war, zu Ekhard in die Küche ging und ich hörte
sie beide eine ganze Weile schnaufen. Auch Vormittag traf ich sie hie
und da beisammen. Ich selbst aber ließ mich von Herrn Ekhard nicht mehr
vögeln. Warum wußte ich eigentlich nicht, doch widerstrebte es mir. Er
packte mich einmal, als er Nachmittag offenbar zu diesem Zweck nach
Hause gekommen war und mich allein traf. Da ich mich sträubte, warf er
mich zu Boden und legte sich auf mich. Aber ich preßte die Knie zusammen
und stieß nach ihm, und da ließ er plötzlich von mir ab, warf mir einen
eigentümlichen Blick zu, und hat mich seither nicht wieder angerührt.
In dem darauffolgenden Jahr ließ ich mich abwechselnd von Alois vögeln,
dann von Herrn Horak, den ich fleißig in seinem Keller aufsuchte. Auch
Schani erschien einmal bei mir, und sagte mir im Hereinkommen schon, daß
seine Mutter und die älteste Schwester die Periode hätten, und daß er
deshalb heute nacht nur die Wetti gepudert habe. Und die folgende Nacht
brauchte er gar nicht zu vögeln. Wir benutzten das, um in der Küche
stehend in aller Eile eine Nummer zu machen, von der mir aber nichts in
Erinnerung geblieben ist, als die Tatsache, daß Schani konstatierte, ich
bekäme schon einen Busen. Wirklich hatte ich schon ein paar kleine
Halbäpfel angesetzt, die ganz hübsch wegstanden. Über den Kleidern waren
sie noch nicht so zu fühlen, aber als ich dann ein paar Tage nachher
Herrn Horaks Hand unter mein Hemd führte, war er davon so entzückt, daß
ihm sein Schwanz sofort wieder stand, obwohl er mich eben zweimal
gefickt hatte, und fortwährend mit meiner Brust spielend, vermochte er
es gleich ein drittesmal, was mir den Wert meines neuen Reizes erst
recht deutlich zeigte. Auch mein Bruder Franz vögelte mich in diesem
Jahre ein paarmal. Er hatte nicht aufgehört an Frau Reinthaler zu
denken, konnte ihrer jedoch nicht habhaft werden.
Zufällig sah ich sie in dieser Zeit am Vormittag auf den Boden gehen.
Ich rief sofort Franz vom Hof herauf und teilte ihm die Gelegenheit mit.
Er kam, wagte es aber nicht, auf den Boden zu gehen. Ich redete ihm zu,
erzählte ihm, daß sich Frau Reinthaler von Herrn Horak vögeln lasse, daß
sie gewiß bereit sein werde, ihn zu nehmen, ich malte ihm aus, was sie
für schöne Brüste habe, -- er traute sich nicht. Frech, wie ich war,
erbot ich mich ihn zu begleiten. Wir trafen Frau Reinthaler, wie sie
oben ihre Wäsche vom Strick abnahm.
»Küß die Hand, Frau Reinthaler«, sagte ich bescheiden.
»Grüß euch Gott, was macht's denn ihr da?« fragte sie.
»Wir kommen zu Ihnen ...«
»So? Was wollt ihr denn von mir?«
»Vielleicht können wir Ihnen ein bissel was helfen«, meinte ich
heuchlerisch.
»Na, na, ich dank' euch schön.« Sie legte eben ein Leintuch zusammen.
Ich schlich mich an sie heran und griff ihr plötzlich an die Brust. Ich
spielte mit ihr, und ließ sie auf- und abschnellen. Franz stand da und
schaute auf diesen Busen und ließ kein Auge davon.
Frau Reinthaler preßte mich an sich und fragte: »Was machst denn da?«
»Das ist so viel schön«, schmeichelte ich ihr.
Sie wurde feuerrot und schielte nach Franz, und lächelte. Und Franz
wurde ebenfalls rot, lächelte dumm, aber wagte es nicht, sich zu nähern.
Ich fuhr ihr unter die Bluse und holte die nackte Dutel heraus, und sie
ließ es geschehen und sah auf Franz, während sie sagte: »Was machst du
denn?«
Da flüsterte ich ihr zu: »Der Franzl möcht' so gern ...«
Ich spürte, wie sich ihre Brustwarze momentan aufrichtete. Trotzdem
fragte sie: »Was möcht' er denn ...?«
»Na, Sie wissen schon ...«, flüsterte ich ihr zu.
Sie lächelte und ließ sich von mir die Brust entblößen, die voll und
weiß unter der roten Bluse hervorkam.
»Ich kann ja aufpassen«, sagte ich, und damit sprang ich von ihr fort.
Ich gab Franz einen Stoß, daß er geradewegs gegen die Brust der Frau
Reinthaler flog. Dann stellte ich mich auf den Vorboden, und wie ich
früher im Keller aufgepaßt hatte, damit niemand die Frau Reinthaler
störe, während sie von Herrn Horak gestemmt wurde, paßte ich jetzt hier
auf dem Boden auf, damit die Frau Reinthaler nicht gestört werde, wenn
sie meinen Bruder bedient. Es war, wenn ich mich recht besinne, die
erste Kuppelei meines Lebens. Es sei denn, man will annehmen, daß ich
meine Mutter an den Ekhard verkuppelt habe, indem ich ihm von ihren
unbefriedigten Nächten erzählte.
Und nimmt man's genau, so muß man wohl zugeben, dieser Ekhard ist wohl
erst durch diese Geschichte auf die Idee geraten, meiner Mutter mit
seinem Lausewenzel zwischen die Beine zu fahren, und er hätte sich
wahrscheinlich ansonsten begnügt, die Tochter in ihren beiden noch
unvollkommenen Löchern auszubohren.
Franz stand also mit seinem Gesicht, wo ich ihn hingeschleudert hatte,
an der nackten Brust der Frau Reinthaler. Sie drückte ihn an sich und
fragte ihn: »Was willst du denn, Kleiner?«
Er antwortete nicht, aber er konnte auch nicht antworten, denn sie hatte
ihm ihre Brustspitze in den Mund gegeben wie einem Säugling, und Franz
leckte oben an dieser süßen Beere, die immer größer wird statt kleiner,
je mehr man von ihr genießt.
Und von seinen Lippenbewegungen, von seiner Zunge begann es die Frau
aber am ganzen Leibe zu reißen. Es durchfuhr sie, und man konnte merken,
daß sie nun bald der Worte überdrüssig sein werde.
Ich dachte nicht weiter daran aufzupassen, sondern beteiligte mich an
dem Spiele, das nun anfing. Frau Reinthaler legte sich auf ihren großen
hochgefüllten Wäschekorb, hob die Röcke auf und ließ ihren schwarz
behaarten Schlund sehen, so daß ich meinte, mein Bruder werde nun per
Kopf darin verschwinden. Dann zog sie den Buben zu sich und versorgte
seinen Kleinen mit einem Ruck in ihrer Bauchtasche, die quatschend
zuschnappte.
Franz begann wie eine Taschenuhr zu ticken, so genau und so präzis, und
Frau Reinthaler fing zu lachen an: »Ach, das kitzelt ja ..., wie gut das
kitzelt ...« Sie lachte und lachte, und lag ganz bewegungslos: »Wie gut
er das kann ...«, meinte sie zu mir, »macht er das oft ...?«
»Ja«, sagte ich.
»Und macht er's immer so g'schwind ...?«
»Ja«, erklärte ich ihr, »der Franzl vögelt immer so schnell ...«
Dann aber kniete ich nieder, nahm ihren Kopf und tat, wie mir Ekhard
getan, ich leckte und kitzelte sie mit der Zunge ins Ohr.
Sie gurrte mit heiserer Stimme vor Wollust.
»Vögel nicht so schnell, Bubi«, bat sie Franz, »ich will auch
stoßen ..., wart ..., so ..., siehst du ..., so geht's noch besser.«
Sie regulierte den Takt von Franzls Bewegungen und schupfte ihn nun mit
ihrem repetierenden Hintern, daß der Wäschekorb krachte.
»Ach ..., es kommt mir ..., ach das ist gut ..., ach, das halt' ich
nicht aus ..., wenn die Pepi mich noch so im Ohr schleckt ..., da
kommt's mir gleich wieder ..., nein ..., Kinder ..., was seid ihr für
Kinder ..., ach ...«
»Du Bubi«, sagte sie plötzlich mitten im Keuchen, »warum nimmst du denn
das Duterl nicht in den Mund ...?«
Franz nahm ihre strotzende Brust und leckte an der Warze, als wollte er
daraus trinken.
Sie schrie auf: »Aber ..., du hörst ja zu vögeln auf ..., du hörst ja
auf ..., und mir kommt's gerad ..., vögel doch! So ..., fester,
schneller ..., ja ..., gut ..., so ist's gut ... Jesses, jetzt laßt er
die Brust wieder aus ..., warum laßt du denn die Brust aus ...?«
Franz hatte es noch immer nicht gelernt, beides zugleich zu tun. Deshalb
ließ ich das Ohr der Frau Reinthaler los, und kam ihm zu Hilfe, indem
ich die schöne volle Brust der Frau Reinthaler nahm. Auch die zweite
Dutel holte ich ihr heraus und über ihrem Kopf liegend, küßte ich sie
bald rechts, bald links, wobei ich spürte, wie der heiße Atem zwischen
meine Beine hinstrich, denn ich lag gerade mit der Fut über ihrem
Gesicht. Sie hatte mir die Röcke zurückgestreift und fuhr mir mit der
Hand an die Spalte, und sie traf mit ihrem Finger den rechten Punkt so
gut, daß es mir sehr wohltat und ich meinte, ich werde auch gevögelt.
Ganz gleichzeitig kam es uns drei. Frau Reinthaler keuchte vor Wonne:
»Ach meine lieben Kinder ..., ach wie gut ist das ..., ach Franzl ...,
ich spür' wie du spritzen tust ..., und du Peperl ..., du bist auch ganz
naß geworden ..., ach ...!«
Dann lagen wir eine Weile ganz matsch übereinander und mochten wohl auch
wie ein Wäsche- oder Kleiderbündel ausgesehen haben.
Frau Reinthaler, die emporschnellte, warf Franz und mich zur Seite. Sie
richtete sich zusammen, war sehr rot und schämte sich plötzlich.
»Nein ..., so was ..., diese Kinder ...«, murmelte sie. Dann lief sie
fort, vom Boden herunter.
Franz und ich blieben allein und machten es uns auf dem Wäschekorb
bequem. Ich nahm seinen Schwanz in den Mund, damit er wieder stehen
könne. Das tat er denn auch bald genug, und jetzt verlangte ich: »Vögel
mich ...«
»Nein«, sagte er, »die Frau Reinthaler könnt' kommen ...«
»Das macht nichts«, redete ich ihm zu, »das macht doch nichts ..., sie
weiß ja, daß wir miteinand vögeln.«
»Ich will aber nicht«, weigerte er sich weiter.
»Warum nicht ...?«
»Weil ..., weil ... du keine Duteln hast«, erklärte er.
»Was?« Ich riß mein Leibchen auf und zeigte ihm meine beiden kleinen
Äpfel.
Er begann damit zu spielen und ich legte mich auf den Korb der Frau
Reinthaler. Franz legte sich auf mich und ich fädelte ihn so schnell
ein, daß er bis an den Schaft drin saß. Er puderte ausgezeichnet, und
mir schmeckte es. Wir waren bald fertig, standen auf, ließen die Wäsche
liegen, wie sie lag, und gingen vom Boden fort.
Franz lauerte von nun ab der Frau Reinthaler noch hitziger auf als
früher. Aber wenn er sie jetzt traf, nahm sie ihn, sooft es ging, in
ihre Wohnung und unterrichtete ihn, wie man es machen müsse, die Fut und
die Brust gleichzeitig mit Schmeicheleien zu versehen. Und Franz machte
bald die erfreulichsten Fortschritte. Oft holte sie ihn aus unserer
Wohnung und hatte jedesmal eine Ausrede. »Franzl, möchst nicht für mich
zum Greisler gehn, um Petroleum?« Oder: »Franzl, möchst mir nicht
g'schwind ein Bier bringen?« Und wenn sie so kam, dann wußte ich schon
jedesmal, was bevorstehe, wenn Franzl mit dem Gebrachten in ihrer
Wohnung verschwand.
So standen die Dinge, als meine Mutter plötzlich starb. Ich war dreizehn
Jahre alt, und mitten in der Entwicklung begriffen. Daß mir die Brüste
so rasch wuchsen, daß mein kleiner Polster zwischen meinen Füßen mit
Locken sich bedeckte, schreibe ich heute doch wohl dem vielen
Geschlechtsverkehr zu, den ich so frühzeitig gepflogen, den heftigen
Reizungen, denen mein Körper ausgesetzt war. Ich hatte die ganze Zeit,
bis zum Tode meiner Mutter, fortwährend gevögelt, und wenn ich es
überschlage, vielleicht mit zwei Dutzend Männern Unzucht getrieben.
Von den hier erzählten war mein Bruder Franz, dann Ferdl, dann Robert,
dann Herr Horak, der mich im Verlauf der Begebenheit vielleicht
fünfzigmal in seinem Bierkeller wie ein Bierfaß mit seiner Pipe
eingespundet hat, dann Alois, bei dem ich etlichemale im Schoß seiner
Klementine »Schluß mit Genuß« sagen hörte, dann der Herr Ekhard, dann
der Schani, den ich aber nur ein einzigesmal zu kosten bekam, ein
einzigesmal den Soldaten, einmal den Burschen, der mich gleich nachher
zwang, ihm zu Willen zu sein. Dazu kommen die vielen Buben, die ich in
den Keller lockte oder die mich in irgendeinem Hausflur, hinter der
Planke oder sonst wo an die Wand lehnten und mir die Spalte ausrieben,
und ein paar Männer, die mich während meiner Streifwege auf dem
Fürstenfeld zusammenfingen, mich auf meine Augen hin gleich anpackten
und es versuchten, mich anzubohren, wobei sie mir aber meistens nur den
Bauch bespritzten. Einige von ihnen habe ich vergessen. In Erinnerung
ist mir nur ein besoffener Schlosser geblieben, der mich auf freiem
Feld, während es noch Tag war, vögelte, mich dabei würgen wollte, dem es
aber sofort kam, als sein Schwanz nur meine Haut berührte. Dann noch ein
alter Mann, ein Hausierer, der mir ein paar blaue Strumpfbänder schenkte
und mich in einem der kleinen Wirtshäuser, die es damals da draußen gab,
auf den Abort lockte. Er setzte sich dort nieder, als wolle er seine
Notdurft verrichten, nahm mich zwischen seine Knie und rieb mir nur von
rückwärts die halbsteife Nudel zwischen die Schenkel. Es werden wohl
zwei Dutzend Männer gewesen sein.
Da starb auf einmal meine Mutter. Sie war nur zwei Tage krank gewesen.
Was ihr gefehlt hat, weiß ich nicht. Ich erinnere mich nur, daß sie am
andern Tag, des Morgens gleich abgeholt und in die Totenkammer gebracht
wurde.
Wir Kinder weinten sehr, denn wir hatten sie sehr lieb gehabt. Sie war
immer gut zu uns gewesen, hatte uns nur selten geschlagen; während wir
uns vor dem Vater, der immer streng war, doch weit eher fürchteten, als
wir ihn gern hatten. Mein Bruder Lorenz sagte damals zu mir: »Das ist
die Strafe Gottes für eure Sünden, für den Franzl seine und für
deine ...« Ich war tief erschüttert von diesen Worten und glaubte ihm.
Deshalb enthielt ich mich auch nach dem Tod meiner Mutter jeglicher
Unzucht. Ich gelobte mir, mich nie wieder vögeln zu lassen, und der
Anblick des Herrn Ekhard war mir unerträglich. Er war übrigens sehr
niedergeschlagen und zog acht Tage, nachdem die Mutter gestorben war,
von uns fort. Ich atmete auf, als er aus dem Hause war. Franzl, mit dem
ich jetzt natürlich noch viel öfter als sonst allein blieb, griff mir
einmal an die Brüste. Aber ich gab ihm eine Ohrfeige, und so ließ er
mich in Ruhe.
Dieser Todesfall bildete einen Abschnitt in meinem jungen Leben. Ich
hätte mich vielleicht noch gebessert, aber es kam anders.
ZWEITES KAPITEL
Ich war jetzt braver als je vorher in der Schule, und fleißiger. Meine
Mutter war schon zwei Monate tot, und ich hatte ein keusches Leben
geführt. Weder einen Schwanz noch eine Schwanzspitze hatte ich die ganze
Zeit gesehen, und wenn mich meine Muschel kitzelte und ich wider Willen
ans Vögeln denken mußte, hatte ich doch der Versuchung widerstanden, das
Verlangen, das mir zwischen den Füßen brannte, mit eigenen Fingern zu
trösten. Da wurde für unsere Klasse und für die ganze übrige
beichtpflichtige Schule wieder eine Beichte angesetzt. Ich wollte mich
diesmal von der Sünde der Unkeuschheit reinigen und beschloß, alles zu
beichten. Auch für die Todsünde, die ich begangen hatte, indem ich meine
Vergehungen bei allen früheren Beichten verschwiegen, wollte ich diesmal
Vergebung erbitten.
Bisher hatte ich, sooft ich bei unserem jungen Katecheten zur Beichte
war, immer nein gesagt, wenn er mich am Schluß meines Bekenntnisses
fragte: »Hast du Unkeuschheit getrieben?«
Es war ein schwarzhaariger, langer und bleicher junger Mann und besaß
eine strenge Miene, vor der ich mich ebenso sehr fürchtete, wie vor
seiner mächtigen Nase. Diesmal aber wollte ich aufrichtig alles
gestehen.
Die Kirche war voll Kinder, und es wurde an drei Beichtstühlen
gebeichtet. Ich kam zu einem ältlichen fetten Kooperator, mit einem
großen runden Gesicht. Ich kannte ihn nur vom Sehen, und er schien mir
nachsichtig zu sein, weil er immer so freundliche Mienen machte.
Zuerst beichtete ich meine kleinen Sünden. Doch er unterbrach mich mit
der Frage: »Hast vielleicht gar Unkeuschheit getrieben?«
Zitternd sprach ich: »Ja ...«
Er legte seine harten Wangen dicht an das Gitter und fragte: »Mit
wem ...?«
»Mit dem Franzl ...«
»Wer ist das?«
»Mein Bruder ...«
»Dein Bruder ...? So! So! Und vielleicht noch mit wem?«
»Ja ...«
»Also ...?«
»Mit dem Herrn Horak ...«
»Wer ist das?«
»Der Bierversilberer in unserm Haus.«
»Mit wem noch ...?« Seine Stimme bebte.
Ich mußte das ganze Namensregister herzählen.
Er rührte sich nicht, als ich fertig war. Nach einer Pause fragte er:
»Wie hast du Unkeuschheit getrieben ...?«
Ich wußte nicht, was ich antworten sollte. Da herrschte er mich an:
»Also wie habt ihr's denn gemacht?«
»Mit ..., na ...«, ich stotterte, »mit dem, was ich zwischen den
Füßen ...«
Er schüttelte den Kopf: »Habt ihr gevögelt ...?«
Mir kam das Wort aus seinem Munde merkwürdig vor, aber ich sagte:
»Ja ...«
»Und hast du's auch in den Mund genommen ...?«
»Ja.«
»Und hast du dir's auch in den Arsch stecken lassen?«
»Ja.«
Er schnaufte und seufzte und sagte: »Ach Gott, ach Gott, mein Kind ...,
Todsünden ..., Todsünden ...«
Ich war ganz weg vor Angst. Er aber meinte: »Da muß ich alles wissen,
hörst du? Alles!« Nach einer Weile fuhr er fort. »Das wird aber eine
lange Beichte werden ..., und die andern Kinder warten ..., bleibt nix
übrig, als daß du extra beichten kommst, verstehst?«
»Ja, Hochwürden ...«, stammelte ich.
»Gleich Nachmittag, so um zwei ..., kommst zu mir ...«
Ich verließ verzweifelt den Beichtstuhl. »Bis dahin«, sagte mir der
Kooperator Mayer noch zum Schluß, »bis dahin erinner dich an alles. Denn
wenn du nicht alles beichten wirst, hilft dir die Absolution nicht ...«
Ich schlich beklommenen Herzens nach Hause, setzte mich nieder und
dachte krampfhaft nach und ließ mir alles, was ich getan hatte, wieder
einfallen. Vor der Beichte im Zimmer des Kooperators hatte ich eine
große Angst und fürchtete mich vor der Buße, die er mir auferlegen
werde. Als es aber Zeit war und ich gehen mußte, fragte mich mein Bruder
Lorenz, wohin ich in dem schönen Kleid wolle, und da sagte ich stolz:
»Zum Herrn Kooperator Mayer muß ich ..., er hat mir's geschafft, daß ich
hinkommen soll.« Lorenz sah mich mit einem sonderbaren Blick an, und ich
ging.
Es war Sommer, aber im großen Pfarrhaus umfing mich eine heilige Kühle
und eine Stille, die mir Ehrfurcht einflößte. Ich las an den Türen die
Namensschilder und klopfte an die Türe, auf der »Kooperator Mayer«
stand. Er öffnete mir selbst. Er war in Hemdärmeln, und seine schwarze
Weste war aufgeknöpft, so daß sein ungeheurer Bauch hervorquoll.
Jetzt, da ich ihn außerhalb des Beichtstuhles zum erstenmale wiedersah,
und sein dickes, rotes Pfaffengesicht mir Respekt erregte und mir
außerdem einfiel, daß er von mir das viele wußte, trieb mir die
Beschämung und die Angst das Blut ins Gesicht.
»Gelobt sei Jesus Christus ...«
»In Ewigkeit ...«, antwortete er. »Da bist du ja ...«
Ich küßte seine fleischige, warme Hand, und er versperrte die Tür. Wir
traten durch ein kleines dunkles Vorgelaß in sein Zimmer. Es ging auf
den Friedhof. Die Fenster standen offen und die grünen Baumwipfel
versperrten jede Aussicht. Das Zimmer war breit und ganz weiß
gestrichen. Ein großes Kruzifix hing schwarz an der einen Wand, davor
stand ein Betschemel. An der anderen Wand stand ein Eisenbett, eine
gesteppte Decke war darüber gebreitet. Ein breiter Schreibtisch nahm die
Mitte ein, mit einem riesigen, schwarzledernen Armsessel.
Der Kooperator zog seine Soutane an und knöpfte sich zu.
»Komm«, sagte er.
Wir traten an das Betpult, knieten nebeneinander nieder und sprachen ein
Vaterunser.
Dann führte er mich an der Hand zum Großvaterstuhl, setzte sich hinein,
und ich stand vor ihm gegen die Schreibtischkante fest angelehnt.
»Na«, sagte er, »also ich höre ...« Ich schwieg aber und wußte nicht wie
anfangen vor Verwirrung.
»Also erzähl ...«
Ich schwieg noch immer und schaute zu Boden.
»Hör du!« begann er, faßte mich unterm Kinn und zwang mich, ihm in die
Augen zu schauen. »Du weißt, daß du schon gesündigt hast ...,
Unkeuschheit ..., eine Todsünde ..., verstehst du ..., und mit deinem
eigenen Bruder ..., Blutschande ...«
Ich hörte das Wort zum erstenmal, und ohne es zu verstehen, erbebte ich.
Er fuhr fort: »... Wer weiß ..., vielleicht bist du ganz verdammt und
hast dein Seelenheil schon verwirkt für immer ..., wenn ich deine Seele
noch retten soll, muß ich alles wissen, ganz genau ..., und du mußt es
mit Bußfertigkeit erzählen.«
Er sprach mit leiser, stockender Stimme, und das machte einen solchen
Eindruck auf mich, daß ich zu weinen anfing.
»Wein nicht«, herrschte er mich an.
Ich schluchzte.
Er wurde milder: »Na, wein nicht, Kinderl. Vielleicht wird alles
gut ..., erzähl nur.«
Ich wischte mir die Tränen ab, vermochte aber nichts zu sagen.
»Ja, ja«, hub er an, »die Versuchung ist groß ..., und du hast
vielleicht gar nicht gewußt, daß das so eine Sünde ist, was ...?
Gewiß ..., du bist ja noch ein Kind ..., du hast nichts gewußt ...,
nicht wahr?«
Ich faßte Mut: »Nein, nichts hab' ich gewußt ...«
»Na«, sprach er, »das ist schon besser ..., bist du nicht dem eigenen
Drang gefolgt ..., sondern verführt worden ..., zum Beispiel ...?«
Ich erinnerte mich sofort an das erste »Vater- und Mutterspiel« und
beteuerte lebhaft: »Ja, Hochwürden ..., verleitet bin ich worden ...«
»Hab' mir's gleich gedacht ...«, nickte er mild, »wenn man das da so
sichtbar trägt ..., das lockt die Versucher an.«
Er legte seine Hand leicht auf meine Brust, die schon spitz und hoch
unter meiner Bluse hervorstach. Ich spürte die Wärme, die von ihm
ausging, und es beruhigte mich, aber mir fiel nichts Arges dabei ein.
»Das ist ein Werk des Satans«, fuhr er fort, »daß er einem Kind schon
die Brüste eines Weibes gibt ...«, dabei nahm er meine andere Brust in
die zweite Hand und hielt nun beide.
»Aber die Duteln müssen die Weiber verstecken«, sprach er weiter, »sie
müssen sie unsichtbar machen und schnüren, um die Männer nicht zu
reizen. Diese Duteln sind Werkzeuge der Wollust ... Gott hat sie dem
Weibe verliehen, damit sie ihre Kinder säugen, aber der Teufel hat ein
Spielzeug für die Unkeuschen daraus gemacht, und man muß sie
verstecken.«
Ich fand nichts dabei, daß er das tat, sondern hörte ihm voll Spannung
und Erbauung zu.
»Also, wie ist das gewesen«, fragte er wieder.
Aber wieder war es mir nicht möglich davon zu reden.
»Gut ...«, meinte er milde, nachdem er eine Weile gewartet hatte, daß
ich spreche: »Gut ..., ich sehe ..., dein Herz ist rein ..., und du
trägst Scham, von diesen Dingen zu sprechen.«
»Ja ..., Hochwürden ...«, stammelte ich begeistert.
»Also ...«, flüsterte er, »ich werde dich fragen, und du wirst
antworten oder besser, wenn du nicht sprechen kannst, wirst du mir durch
Gebärden zeigen, was du verbrochen hast! Ja?«
»Ich will's, Hochwürden«, versprach ich dankbar, nahm seine Hand von
meiner Brust und küßte sie inbrünstig.
»Ich muß«, erläuterte er weiter, »alle Grade und Arten der Unkeuschheit
kennen, die du begangen hast. Also beginne. Hast du den Schweif in den
Mund genommen ...?«
Ich nickte.
»Oft ...?«
Ich nickte wieder.
»Und was hast du mit ihm gemacht ... der Reihe nach ...?«
Ich schaute ihn ratlos an.
»Hast du mit der Hand gespielt damit?«
Ich nickte wieder.
»Wie hast du gespielt ...?«
Ich stand da, ohne zu wissen, was ich sagen oder tun sollte.
»Zeig mir genau«, flüsterte er, »wie du's gemacht hast ...«
Meine Ratlosigkeit stieg auf ihren Gipfel.
Er lächelte salbungsvoll: »Nimm nur meinen Schweif ...«, sagte er, »an
dem geweihten Priester ist alles rein ..., nichts an ihm ist Sünde ...,
und nichts an ihm ist sündig.«
Ich war sehr erschrocken und rührte mich nicht.
Er faßte mich bei der Hand und flüsterte weiter: »Nimm nur mein Glied
und zeige mir alle deine Sünden. Ich leihe dir meinen Leib, damit du vor
meinem Angesicht beichtest und dich reinigest.« Und damit führte er
mich an sein Hosentürl.
Ich mußte tief unter seinen Bauch greifen und zitterte vor Ehrerbietung
dabei. Er knöpfte sich auf, und ein dicker kurzer Schwanz stand aufrecht
und steif unter der schwarzen Mauer seiner Hose.
»Wie hast du mit ihm gespielt?« fragte er.
Ich war furchtbar verlegen. Aber ich faßte, wenn auch zaghaft, die
Nudel, zu der er mich führte, umschloß sie mit der Hand und fuhr zwei-,
dreimal schüchtern auf und nieder.
Er machte ein ernstes Gesicht und forschte weiter: »Das war alles?
Verheimliche mir jetzt nichts ..., ich sag' es dir ...«
Ich fuhr noch ein paarmal hin und her.
»Was hast du noch damit getan?«
Ich erinnerte mich an den Griff Klementinens, faßte ihn mit Daumen und
Mittelfinger unter der Eichel und tupfte mit dem Zeigefinger die Vorhaut
herab.
Er lehnte sich im Großvaterstuhl zurück. »Was hast du noch an verruchten
Künsten geübt?«
Ich scheute mich, mehr zu tun, ließ ihn beim Schwanz los und lispelte:
»... In den Mund ..., hab' ich's genommen ...«
»Wie ...?« Er atmete heftig, »... wie hast du das getan ...?«
Zweifelnd blickte ich ihn an. Aber er schaute voll Ernst und Würde auf
mich und meinte: »Bist du bereit? Oder willst du mir undankbar sein, für
die Gnade, die ich dir erweise. Wisse denn, du bist von aller Sünde
schon halb gereinigt, wenn du mich so berührst wie deine Buhlen ...«
Das leuchtete mir außerordentlich ein, und ich pries mich glücklich, daß
ich so von Sünden kommen dürfe.
Wie er also nochmals fragte: »Was hast du noch damit getan«, kniete ich
ungesäumt nieder und nahm vorsichtig seinen Schwanz in den Mund.
»Nur das Spitzel ...«, fragte er.
Augenblicklich stieß ich mir den Storchenschaft tiefer in den Rachen.
»Und sonst nichts ...?« tönte die Stimme von oben.
Ich fuhr mit den Lippen auf und ab, suzelte und sog an diesem Speer und
kitzelte mit der Zunge daran herum, und eine heftige Erregung erfaßte
mich. Aber ich wußte damals nicht, ob es mehr Angst, Bußfertigkeit oder
Geilheit war.
Ich hörte, wie der Kooperator stöhnte: »Ach ..., ach ..., so was ..., so
eine Sünderin ..., ach ..., ach ...«, und ich bedauerte ihn so sehr, daß
ich nachließ, ihm diese Qual nicht länger zu bereiten, sondern aufhörte.
Ich ließ seinen Schwanz aus meinem Mund gleiten, trocknete ihn, der in
meiner Hand zuckte, mit dem Taschentuch sorgsam ab und stand auf.
Der Kooperator war blaurot im Gesicht und haschte mit der Hand nach mir.
»Und was noch ..., was hast du mit den Schwänzen, so du gehabt hast ...,
noch getan ...«
»Unkeuschheit getrieben, Hochwürden«, flüsterte ich.
»Das weiß ich ...«, flüsterte er, nach Atem ringend, »du hast mir jetzt
drei Arten davon gezeigt ..., hast dich von drei Arten gereinigt, ... du
hast aber noch mehr mit einem Schwanz getan ..., willst du jetzt
leugnen ...«
»Nein, Hochwürden ...«
»Also, was war's, was du getan hast ...?«
»Gevögelt habe ich, Hochwürden ...«
»Wie gevögelt ...«
»Na ..., gevögelt«, wiederholte ich.
»Damit weiß ich gar nichts«, brauste er auf, »du mußt mir zeigen, wie
du's gemacht hast ...«
Ich war wieder ratlos. Meine Röcke aufzuheben und mich selbst mit seinem
Schweif zu vögeln, traute ich mich doch nicht.
»Soll ich dir's vielleicht zeigen, wie du's gemacht hast ...«, fragte
er. »Soll ich dich selber fragen?«
»Ja ...«
Ich war jetzt selbst begierig, daß alles geschehen möge und war froh
zugleich, denn mit ihm schien es ja keine Sünde, sondern ein Mittel, die
Sünde abzubüßen. Und da ich so lange schon keinen Schwanz im Mund oder
sonstwo gehabt hatte, war mir bei diesem Schlecken doch der Wunsch
erwacht, diesen Pfeil auch in das Zentrum gestoßen zu kriegen.
Der Kooperator stand auf und führte mich zum Bett.
»Wie hast du's gemacht ...?«
Ich sagte: »Hochwürden wissen schon ...«
»Nichts weiß ich«, fiel er ein, »... du mußt mir alles sagen. Hast du
dich niedergelegt, oder bist du oben gelegen ...?«
»Einmal so und dann wieder so ..., Hochwürden ...«
»Also wie bist du unten gelegen ...?«
Ich legte mich, wie ich stand, quer mit dem Rücken über das Bett. Meine
Beine hingen über den Rand herab.
»So bist du gelegen ...?«
»Ja.«
»Da wirst du aber wohl schwerlich was angestellt haben ...«, meinte er,
»da kann dir ja der böse Versucher nicht an den Leib ..., was hast du
dann noch gemacht ..., oder hat er dir die Röcke aufgehoben ...?«
»Ja.«
»So vielleicht ...?« Er streifte mit einem Ruck meine Kleider in die
Höhe, so daß meine nackten Schenkel und die blondbraune, frischbehaarte
Grotte freilagen.
»War es so ...«, fragte er.
»Ja ..., Hochwürden«, gab ich liegend zur Antwort.
Er schob meine Knie auseinander: »Und so ...?«
»Ja.«
Er trat zwischen meine Beine und sein dicker Bauch lag auf dem meinigen,
obwohl der Herr Kooperator stand.
»Und ist der Schweif so zu dir hineingekommen, um dir fleischliche Lüste
zu bereiten ...?«
Stehend schob er mir seine geweihte Kerze, die ganz warm war, an die
Öffnung. Ich mußte, als ich das verspürte, ihm entgegenstoßen. Langsam,
sehr langsam drang er ein. Der Kooperator, dessen Gesicht ich nicht sah,
keuchte laut. Ich hielt mit meiner Muschel seinen Stiel umklammert, der
ziemlich weit eingedrungen war. Jetzt wollte ich auch gevögelt sein. Da
es keine Sünde war, erst recht. Ich lag da mit einem Gefühl, in das sich
Staunen, Wollust, Freude und Lachlust mengten und in dem meine
Befangenheit sich endlich löste. Ich fing an zu begreifen, daß der Herr
Kooperator eine Komödie spielte, und es einfach darauf abgesehen hatte,
mich zu pudern. Aber ich war entschlossen, diese Komödie mitzumachen,
mir nichts merken zu lassen, und im übrigen glaubte ich doch daran, daß
der Herr Kooperator die Macht habe, mich von meinen Sünden zu
absolvieren. Wie er nun so mit seinem Pfahl in meinem Fleische steckte,
und nicht hin- noch herfahren wollte, sondern nur schnaufte, begann ich
mit dem Popo auf- und niederzuhüpfen, wodurch sein Keuchen sich nur
vermehrte.
»Hochwürden ...«, flüsterte ich.
»Was denn ...?« fragte er schnaubend.
»So ist's nicht gewesen«, sagte ich leise.
»Wie denn ...?«
»Hin und her, aus und ein ist er mir gefahren.«
Er begann vorsichtig, aber kräftig und rasch zu stoßen. »So vielleicht?«
»Ach ...«, rief ich, von Wollustschauder durchzuckt, »ach ..., ja ...,
so ..., nur ..., schneller ..., Hochwürden ..., schneller ...«
»Brav, mein Kind ..., brav ...«, keuchte er, »so ..., sag mir alles, wie
es war ..., sprich nur ...« Er konnte nicht weiter reden, so stürmisch
flog sein Atem und so heftig remmelte er.
Ich ließ mich nicht weiter aufmuntern: »Ach ..., ach ..., so war's ...,
so ist's gut ..., so ist's gut ..., besser ..., Hochwürden ..., spritzen
Sie ..., spritzen Sie ..., mir kommt's ..., mir kommt's ..., ich kann
nichts dafür ..., aber ..., Hochwürden ..., der Schwanz ist so gut ...,
so viel gut ist das, was Hochwürden tun ...«
Er stützte seine Hände auf und war über mich gebeugt, so weit es sein
fetter Bauch gestattete. Sein dunkles breites Gesicht war blau
angelaufen. Er sah mich mit Augen an wie ein abgestochenes Kalb,
remmelte wie ein Ziegenbock und flüsterte: »Nimm nur den
Gnadenhammer ..., so ..., so ..., das schadet dir nicht ..., nimm nur
Mäderl ..., spritzen soll ich ..., das willst du auch ...? Also gut,
ich werde spritzen ..., werde dich salben ...«
»Hochwürden«, fiel ich ihm ins Wort, »Hochwürden, ich hab' auch mit der
Brust dabei gesündigt.«
»Wieso ...?« Er glotzte mich fragend an.
»Weil ..., ach ..., ach ..., mir kommt's schon wieder ..., weil ich mir
beim Vögeln hab' immer die Duteln streicheln und küssen und absuzeln
lassen.« Ich sagte das, damit er es tue, denn ich fühlte den Wunsch,
meine Brüste gepreßt und gestreichelt zu bekommen.
Aber seine Fettleibigkeit hinderte ihn, auch meine Brüste zu bedienen.
Mit den Händen mußte er sich auf dem Bett stützen, und mit dem Kopf
erreichte er mich überhaupt nicht.
»Das kommt ..., später ..., später ..., will ich deine Duterln
hernehmen«, sagte er stoßend. »Laß mich zuerst nur spritzen ...,
ach ..., ach ..., beweg dich nur, Muzerl, das ist mir angenehm ..., reib
nur dein Fotzerl, dein süßes hin und her ..., ach du kannst es gut ...,
sehr gut kannst du's ..., laß mich nur ausspritzen, dann werd' ich deine
schönen kleinen Duteln schon noch hernehmen ..., so ..., mir
kommt's ..., heiliger Gott ..., das ist süß ...« Und indem er so
stammelte, platzte ihm der Same los, und ein solcher Strom flutete aus
ihm zu mir herüber, daß es bei seinen letzten Stößen laut quatschte.
Als er fertig war, sagte er mit Würde: »Du hast gehört meine Tochter,
was ich gesprochen habe ... Siehe, ich habe die Reden des Erzfeindes und
des Verführers nachgeahmt, in deinem Interesse ..., damit auch die
unflätigen Worte, die du in buhlerischer Umarmung vernommen hast, ihre
böse Gewalt über dich verlieren.«
Ich saß auf dem Bettrand und wischte mit meinem Sacktuch die
Überschwemmung fort, die der Kooperator zwischen meinen Beinen
angerichtet hatte. Und ich merkte sehr wohl, wie er jetzt mir vorlügen
wollte. Aber ich sagte nichts. Gevögelt war eben gevögelt, der
Kooperator war für mich jetzt wie der Herr Horak oder der Herr Ekhard.
Nur interessierte er mich doch mehr, weil er ja viel feiner war als
diese und weil ich bei alledem sehr viel Respekt vor ihm hatte. Und dann
auch, weil ich ja auch gern zu ihm hielt, da er für mich den Vorzug
hatte, mich doppelt zu erfreuen, erstens durch seinen Gnadenhammer und
zweitens durch seinen Sündenablaß, an den ich noch immer glaubte.
Er hatte sich wieder in den Großvaterstuhl gesetzt und rief mich.
»Komm jetzt«, sagte er noch schnaufend, »jetzt werde ich dir nach deinem
Willen die Duteln behandeln.« Er knöpfte mir das Kleid auf und nahm
meine runden kleinen Brüste heraus. Sie standen wie zwei Elfenbeinkugeln
von mir ab und trugen die Warzen, als läge auf dem Elfenbein je eine
Himbeere. Der Kooperator mochte ein Freund von so frischem Obst sein,
denn er nahm in aller Eile eine Himbeere nach der andern in den Mund und
sutzelte sie ab, daß sie davon nur noch glänzender wurden, wie manche
Obstverkäufer in Capri ihre Erdbeeren mit der Zunge ablecken, um ihnen
durch den Speichel einen appetitlichen Glanz zu verleihen.
Als er das mit vielem Grunzen und Schnaufen eine hübsche Weile so
getrieben hatte, sagte er: »Ist es so recht ...?«
»Ja«, antwortete ich, »so ist's recht ...«
»Na, und bist denn du ganz faul gewesen wenn dir an der Brust gespielt
wurde?« fragte er weiter, indem er meine Gspaßlaberln auf und ab hupfen
ließ. »Hast denn du gar nichts dabei getan? Hast du nicht mit der Nudel
gespielt?«
Nun wußte ich, was er wollte und begann, sein Gehänge zu traktieren. Es
war aber schlaff geworden und erhob sich nicht mehr.
»Setz dich herauf ...«, befahl er mir.
Ich setzte mich vor ihm auf den Schreibtisch, so daß meine Füße auf den
Knien sich stützten.
»Jetzt«, sagte er, »jetzt kommt das beste, die Hauptsache ...«
Ich wußte nicht was er meinte und sah ihn lächelnd an.
»Ja, meine Tochter«, fuhr er stöhnend fort, »jetzt will ich selbst dich
reinigen und alles austilgen, was deinen Schoß befleckt.«
Damit nahm er meine Kleider hoch, daß ich wieder ganz entblößt war. Er
legte sich meine Schenkel über seine Schultern, hatte seinen Kopf
zwischen meinen Beinen, und ich mußte mich mit den Ellbogen auf die
Schreibtischplatte stützen, damit ich nicht rücklings auf den harten
Tisch zu liegen kam.
Er hatte seinen Mund meiner Spalte genähert, und sein heißer Atem
bestrich mich dort. Ich wußte nicht, was er wollte, aber ich hoffte auf
etwas Angenehmes.
Wie ward mir, als ich seine dicken heißen Lippen auf meinen Schamlippen
spürte, als er mit seiner weichen, heißen Zunge einmal von unten her bis
oben hin meine Spalte auswischte. Ein nie gekanntes Gefühl ließ mich
erbeben. Diese Wonne hatte ich noch nicht gespürt. Bisher ließen sich
die Männer immer von meinem Mund bedienen, aber dieser wackere Priester
war der erste, der mir auch seine Zunge lieh.
Ich zuckte mit den Hinterbacken und zog meine Männerfalle zusammen, als
gelte es einen neuen Stößer einzufangen.
Er hob den Kopf und fragte mich: »Ist dir das angenehm ...?«
Vor Begierde zitternd und nach mehr verlangend sagte ich rasch: »Ja,
Hochwürden.« Er fuhr wieder mit der Zunge über mein Loch und über meinen
Wollustweiser hin, so zart, daß die Wonne peinigend und beglückend war.
Dann fragte er wieder: »Hat dir das schon einer gemacht ...?«
»Nein«, sagte ich und hob den Popo, daß meine Muschel wie ein
dargereichter Becher an die Lippen gesetzt wurde.
»Das reinigt dich«, sagte er, »das nimmt alles von dir ab ...«
Ich faßte mit einer Hand keck seinen Kopf, erwischte ihn bei der Tonsur
und duckte ihn herunter, damit er von seinem Mund einen besseren
Gebrauch mache als reden.
Er fing nun an, zuerst meinen Kitzler zu bearbeiten. Mir war, als säße
alles, was Empfindung war, plötzlich dort unten, mein Mund, meine
Brustwarzen, das Innerste meiner Fut. Wo seine Zungenspitze mich
berührte, schien mir Elektrizität in den ganzen Körper einzuschießen.
Ich verlor den Atem, das Zimmer drehte sich mit mir, und ich schloß die
Augen.
Da ließ er plötzlich ab davon, glitschte tiefer und fuhr mir mit der
Zunge in die Einfahrt. Ich tanzte mit dem Popo einen Czardas auf dem
Schreibtisch. Denn was war das Vögeln gegen diesen Reiz? Ich fuhr ihm,
indem ich mit dem Arsch auf- und absauste, mit meiner Spalte über das
ganze Gesicht. Ich fühlte seine Zunge bald tief in mich eindringen, bald
auf dem Kitzler zitternde Wirbel schlagen, bald seine Lippen an meiner
ganzen Geschichte saugen. Es kam mir, daß ich glaubte, mein Inneres
werde ausgeleert. Was mir da geschah, war besser noch als das beste
Vögeln, und doch hatte ich dabei nur einen Gedanken, den Gedanken an
einen riesigen Schweif, der mir vorschwebte, den ich mir wünschte, und
der in mich hineinfahren sollte bis zum Magen.
»Es kommt mir ..., immerfort kommt's mir«, rief ich aus, »ach, das ist
wie im Himmel, Hochwürden ..., so gut ist mir's noch nie gewesen ...,
bitte ..., vögel mich, Hochwürden ..., gib mir deinen Schweif ..., vögel
mich ..., nein, bleib ..., so ..., so ..., ach ich schrei ..., ich
schrei ...«
Ich fühlte mich plötzlich umgeworfen, lag mit dem Kopf auf dem
Tintenfaß. Hochwürden aber hatte sich erhoben. Sein Gesicht tauchte blau
angelaufen mit Schaum vor dem Mund vor mir auf.
»Komm«, schnaufte er mir zu, »setz dich auf mich ..., dann kannst du den
Schweif noch einmal haben.«
Er lag dann in seinem Großvaterstuhl weit zurückgelehnt. Ich hielt mich
an beiden Armlehnen fest und ritt auf der Spitze seiner Lanze, denn mehr
kam unter seinem dicken Bauch nicht zum Vorschein. Damit ich aber nicht
herunterfalle, hatte er meine beiden Brüste mit seinen Fäusten
umklammert, und so ließen wir die zweite Nummer abschnurren, die uns
allen beiden mächtig viel Vergnügen bereitete.
Dann ließ er mich von seinem Knie herabgleiten und reichte mir ein
Handtuch. Wie ich mich abwischen wollte meinte er: »Wart, Mauserl, du
wirst brunzen wollen ...«, und er brachte mir selbst einen riesigen
blauen Nachttopf herbei. Ich ließ mein Wasser da hinein, und all das
heilige Öl, mit dem mich der Kooperator so reichlich gesalbt hatte.
Er stand dabei und knöpfelte seine Hose zu. Dann machte ich mich
zurecht, und als ich mein Kleid wieder geschlossen hatte, nicht ohne,
daß der Kooperator vorher von meinen Brüsten tätschelnd Abschied nahm,
wartete ich der weiteren Dinge.
Aber es kam nichts. Der Kooperator sagte: »Geh jetzt, meine Tochter, ich
werde heute für dich beten, und morgen kommst du in der Früh zu mir in
die Kirche beichten ...«
Ich küßte ihm die Hand und ging. Wie er mir das Vorgemach aufschließen
wollte, klopfte es draußen.
Er öffnete und eine Schulkameradin von mir stand draußen: »Ich hab' heut
keine Zeit mehr«, sagte ihr Hochwürden ziemlich unwirsch. »Komm
vielleicht morgen nachmittag ...«
Damit schob er auch mich hinaus und schloß hinter uns zu.
Wir zwei Mädchen gingen nun zusammen fort und sprachen natürlich
miteinander. Sie hieß Melanie und war die Tochter eines Gastwirts, und
obwohl sie auch nur dreizehn Jahre alt war, sah sie doch aus, als ob sie
selbst schon eine kleine Gastwirtin sei. Sie war sehr dick, so dick, daß
sie beim Gehen die Beine breit auseinandersetzte. Sie hatte einen
großen, breiten Popo und so volle Brüste, daß sie weit von ihr
abstanden und sie hinderten, ihren Nabel zu sehen.
Wie wir die Treppe heruntergingen fragte sie mich: »Was hast du denn
beim hochwürdigen Herrn gemacht ...?«
»Was hast denn du bei ihm wollen ...?« gab ich zurück.
»Ich kann mir schon denken«, meinte sie, »was es war ...«
»Na, was soll's gewesen sein ...?«
»Gewiß eine Unkeuschheits-Beicht ...!«
Ich mußte lachen.
»Warst schon oft bei ihm?« fragte sie.
»Heut zum erstenmal ..., und du?«
»Ach ich ...«, sie lächelte, »ich war vielleicht schon zwanzigmal
oben ..., und die Ferdinger und die Großbauer und die Huser und die
Schurdl auch ...«
Sie nannte lauter Namen von Schulkameradinnen.
Ich war sehr erstaunt.
Melanie aber fuhr weiter: »Hat er dir's auch mit dem Mund gemacht ...?«
»Dir ...?« fragte ich vorsichtig.
»Natürlich«, sagte sie schnell. »Er macht mir's immer mit dem Mund ...,
einer jeden macht er's so ..., das ist wegen der Reinigung ..., und gut
ist das ..., nicht wahr ...?«
»Ja«, gestand ich, »sehr gut.«
»Hat's dir schon einer mit dem Mund gemacht ...?« wollte sie wissen.
»Nein«, sagte ich, »das war heut zum erstenmal ...«
Sie prahlte: »Mir macht's immer unser Zahlkellner ..., sooft ich
will ..., ich brauch' nur in die Burschenkammer gehen ...«
»Und die andern Burschen ...?« meinte ich.
»Ah, es kommt niemand herein, wenn wir drin sind ..., die wissen
schon ...«
»Was?« fragte ich perplex, »die wissen das?«
»Natürlich«, erwiderte sie gleichmütig, »die pudern mich ja auch, wenn
ich will.«
Sie erzählte mir: »Wir haben einen Zahlkellner, einen Piccolo und einen
Schankburschen und dann den Kutscher, die schlafen alle in der
Burschenkammer. Und vor zwei Jahren, da bin ich mit dem Kutscher Johann
einmal nach Simmering gefahren. Na, und es war schon finster, und wie
wir übers Feld kommen, da hab ich auf einmal seine Hand auf meinen
Duteln gespürt. Ich hab' schon damals so große Duteln gehabt wie du
heute. »Johann«, sag' ich zu ihm, »was machen S' denn?«
Er gibt mir keine Antwort und laßt das Pferd stehen, und fahrt mir in
die Kleider, so daß er die nackte Brust gehabt hat. »Johann«, sag' ich
ihm, »was machen S' denn?« Da hebt er mir die Röcke auf und griff mir an
die Fut. »Was wollen S' denn, Johann?« sag' ich zu ihm, aber ich hab'
ganz gut gewußt, was er will. Die Ferdinger hat mir ja schon lang alles
gesagt, wie das ist, mit Mann und Frau, nur selber hab' ich's noch nicht
getan gehabt.«
»Was wollen S' denn, Johann ...?« frag' ich noch einmal.
Da läßt er mich los und steigt vom Wagen. Und dann sagt er: »Kommen S'
Fräulein Melanie ...«, und hebt mich vom Bock herunter. Und gleich am
Weg legt er mich ins Getreide. Ich hab' mich gefreut, denn ich hab' mir
gedacht, jetzt werd ich's sehen, wie das ist, und ob mir die Ferdinger
die Wahrheit gesagt hat.
Wie ich so dalag, legt er sich gleich zwischen meine Füße. »Was wollen
S' denn, Johann?« frug ich. Aber er packt mich bei die Duteln, und im
selben Moment spür' ich, wie er mir hineinfuhr. Ich hab' schreien müssen
vor Schmerz, aber er hielt mir den Mund zu. Und dann, wie er so hin- und
herg'fahren ist, hat's mir angefangen zu schmecken. Aber ich hab' nur zu
ihm gesagt: »Was machen S' denn, Johann?« Er hat mir keine Antwort
gegeben, hat mir's hineingespritzt, und dann sind wir aufgestanden und
haben uns wieder auf den Bock gesetzt. -- Nach einer langen Weile erst,
sagte er: »Die Fräul'n Melanie muß sich zu Haus abwaschen, daß niemand
was von Blut merkt.«
»Was für ein Blut?« fragte ich.
»Na«, sagt er, »weil die Fräul'n Melanie noch eine Jungfrau war ...«
Ich hätte gern gewußt, wie das Ding ausschaut und wie es sich anfühlt,
was er mir da hineingesteckt hat, aber ich traute mich nicht.
Da fängt er, nachdem wir wieder ein Stück gefahren sind, an: »Die
Fräul'n Melanie wird wohl nix verraten, was?«
Da hab' ich mich fest an ihn angelehnt, und hab' ihm in die Hosen
gegriffen und er hat mir seinen Schwanz gegeben, und mit dem hab' ich
gespielt, ohne daß wir ein Wort miteinander sprachen, bis die ersten
Häuser da waren.
Dann sagte er auf einmal: »Der Peter ist ein Lugenschippel.«
»Warum?« fragte ich.
»Na, weil er mir erzählt hat, er hat die Fräul'n Melanie gevögelt ...«
Ich bekam einen großen Zorn und schwur dem Johann, daß mich der Peter
nicht angerührt habe. Der Peter war der Schankbursch.
Nach ein paar Tagen war ich im Stall, und da hat mich der Johann auf die
Futterkisten gelegt und mich gepempert. Aber damals ist der Schwanz noch
nicht so ganz tief hineingegangen wie jetzt.«
»Geht er bei dir denn ganz hinein ...?« sagte ich neidisch, »von einem
Großen der Schwanz?«
Sie lachte: »Aber natürlich, schon lang, unser Zahlkellner, der Leopold,
der hat einen so großen wie ein Hengst, und der geht bis auf'n Beutel
hinein, und der vom Kooperator auch ...« Sie war stolz darauf.
»Das glaub' ich nicht ...«, meinte ich.
»Wenn du's nicht glaubst, laß bleiben«, schmollte sie.
Nach einer kleinen Pause schlug sie mir vor: »Weißt, wenn du's nicht
glaubst, komm mit zu mir, ich geh' sowieso in die Burschenkammer, weil
mir's der hochwürdige Herr heut nicht gemacht hat, und wenn der Leopold
da ist, kannst du ja selbst es sehen. Die Ferdinger hat's auch nicht
geglaubt und hat auch schon einmal zugeschaut ...«
»Gut«, meinte ich darauf, »ich geh' mit dir.« Mich interessierte es,
dieses schöne, dicke Mädchen mit den großen Brüsten an der Arbeit zu
sehen, ich hoffte, endlich mit ihren Duteln spielen zu können. Denn von
jeher hatten Frauenbrüste einen großen Reiz auf mich geübt. Und dann
hoffte ich, vielleicht zu einem neuen Schweif zu kommen und heute noch
eine Nummer zu machen, was mir nicht unlieb war.
Melanie erzählte weiter: »Wieder ein paar Tag' d'rauf, hab ich den
Johann gesucht und geh ins Burschenzimmer. Es war aber nur der
Schankbursch, der Peter, da. Und wie ich den seh', fallt mir die Lüge
ein, die er von mir gesagt hat, und ich sag' ihm: `Sie Lugenschippel,
was haben Sie denn zum Johann über mich geprahlt ...?´ -- `Was denn?´
meinte er lächelnd. Ich kam über sein Lachen erst recht in Wut und
schnauz' ihn an: `Sie haben gesagt, daß Sie mich gevögelt haben ...´ Und
damit hab' ich mich natürlich nur selbst verraten, denn da hat der Peter
gleich gewußt, daß der Kutscher mich gepudert hat.
Das hab' ich ihm auch angemerkt, wie er mich so lächelnd angeschaut hat.
Dann sagte er: `Der Johann ist selbst ein Lügner ..., ich hab' nicht
gesagt, ich hab' die Fräul'n Melanie gevögelt ..., ich hab' nur gemeint,
ich möcht' die Fräul'n Melanie gern einmal verbimbsen ..., nur das hab'
ich ihm gesagt ..., und da ist doch nichts dabei ..., wenn doch die
Fräul'n Melanie so viel schön ist ..., da kann sie doch nicht bös' sein,
daß man sich das wünscht ...´ Damit kam er zu mir herbei und streichelte
mich auf der Brust. Mein Zorn war weg und vögeln wollte ich. Und wie er
mir sagte: `Gehn S' Fräul'n, lassen S' mich drüber´, schaffte ich ihm,
er soll die Tür zuriegeln.
Na, und da hat er mich auf sein Bett gelegt und hat mich schön langsam
gevögelt.«
»Puderst du mit dem Piccolo auch?« fragte ich.
»Mit dem Maxl?« Sie lachte. »Natürlich. Der hat mich ja einmal mit dem
Peter belauscht, und dann ist er mir am andern Tag nachgeschlichen, wie
ich auf den Abort gegangen bin, und da hat er mir gesagt, daß er alles
weiß und daß ich ihn lassen soll. Na, so hab' ich ihn halt gelassen. Wir
haben eine Stehpartie gemacht. Ist ja nix dabei.«
»Und wie ist's denn mit dem Leopold, mit dem Zahlkellner?« wollte ich
wissen.
»O der ...«, sie hängte sich in mich ein. »Weißt du, der Maxl hat mir
von dem erzählt, daß er einen so langen Schweif hat, und da bin ich so
neugierig gewesen. Der Leopold darf immer bis zum Mittag schlafen, weil
er die Nacht am längsten auf ist, und da ist er Vormittag allein im
Burschenzimmer. Da bin ich halt einmal zu ihm hinauf.
Er war noch im Bett und hat geschlafen, und ich hab' die Tür verriegelt.
Er ist aufgewacht, und ich sag' ihm: `Wer wird denn so lang im Bett
sein ..., auf! auf!´ -- `Lassen S' mich nur liegen ...´, meinte er.
`Nein!´ sag' ich und fing ihn zu kitzeln an. Und wie er so aushaut,
erwischt er mich bei der Dutel, und da bin ich ganz ruhig gworden und
hab' ihn nur angeschaut. Da packt er mich fester an und zieht mich zu
sich, und wie ich einmal bei ihm gelegen bin, hat er mir seinen Schweif
gleich in die Hand gegeben. Ich sag' dir ..., so lang ist der ...«
Sie zeigte mir die Länge mit der Hand.
»Er hat zum Vögeln angefangen, hat aber gleich aufgehört. `Ich fürcht'
mich, ich tu' Ihnen was, Fräul'n, mit dem Salzstangel da´, sagte er,
`wir werden es anders machen.´ Na, und da ist er herunter und hat mich
zu schlecken angefangen, daß ich geglaubt hab', ich werd' närrisch. Und
wie ich dann ganz hin war, sagt er: `Jetzt kann ich.´ Und nimmt mir die
Duteln heraus, steckt seinen Schwanz dazwischen und vögelt mich zwischen
der Brust, daß es mir dann bis ins Gesicht gespritzt hat ...«
»Was?« fragte ich sie, »der Zahlkellner macht dir's immer nur zwischen
der Brust ...?«
»Ach nein, jetzt nicht mehr ...«, lachte sie, »das war vor zwei Jahren,
wie ich erst elf Jahre alt war ..., jetzt vögelt er mich schon ganz ...
ich hab' dir doch gesagt, du kannst mitkommen, zuschauen ...«
Wir waren bei ihrem Haus angelangt und gingen durch die Wirtsstube.
»Leopold«, sagte sie, »ist der Vater zu Haus ...?«
»Nein«, antwortet er, »der Vater ist im Kaffeehaus.«
»Und die Mutter ...?«
»Die schlaft noch ...«
»Und der Johann ...?«
Er lachte: »Der ist in Simmering ...«
Sie sagte: »Also wir gehen hinauf ...«
Leopold verfärbte sich und flüsterte: »Ich komm' gleich ...«
Er war ein kleiner Mensch mit einem bartlosen, faltigen gelben Gesicht
und einer langen schiefen Nase. Ich fand ihn abscheulich, aber ich war
begierig, seine Stange zu sehen.
Wir gingen in das Burschenzimmer, einen großen, weißgetünchten Raum, in
dem vier Eisenbetten standen.
Gleich darauf erschien Leopold.
Er war vor mir verlegen, aber Melanie warf sich auf das Bett und rief
ihn zu sich.
»Vielleicht«, sagte Leopold zu mir, »will das Fräulein auch ein bisserl
pudern ...?«
Dann kniete er nieder, schlug Melanie die Kleider zurück und vergrub
sein Gesicht in ihren Schoß.
Ich setzte mich ihr zu Häupten und sah, wie sie die Augen verdrehte.
»Wart«, sagte ich, »ich werd' dir auch was tun ...«, und ich fiel über
sie her, riß ihr die Kleider auf und war ganz begeistert von ihrer
Brust. Sie hatte zwei Duteln, so groß wie die von Klementine, aber die
schwappten nicht weich hin und her, sondern standen fest und hart wie
zwei Kürbisse so groß von ihr weg, und dazu hatte sie kleine rosarote
Wärzchen.
Wenn man ihre Brust drückte und preßte, so viel man nur wollte, sie
schnellte immer elastisch in die Höhe.
Ich bearbeitete sie mit meinen Händen und zuletzt begann ich, die Warzen
zu küssen und zu saugen.
Sie kreischte unter mir, warf sich unter Leopolds Futküssen mit dem Popo
hoch empor.
»Das halt' ich nicht aus ..., das halt' ich nicht aus«, schrie sie, »o
Gott ..., wie gut ist das ..., ja ..., schleck nur die Dutel ...,
schleck sie nur ..., Jesus, wenn ich nur könnt' ..., wenn ich nur
könnt', ich möcht' auch was tun ..., ich möcht' dir's auch
schlecken ..., warum denn nicht?« sagte sie plötzlich mitten unter ihrem
Kreischen, »es ist doch nichts dabei ..., wenn ich nur deine Fut
erwischen könnte ..., ich möcht' dir's machen, wie der Leopold ...
Ah ..., ah ... ah ...« Sie schrie so laut, daß ich Angst bekam, ihre
Brust losließ und meinte:
»Es wird vielleicht jemand hören ...«
Leopold hörte auf und sagte: »Da hört kein Mensch was.«
Der Speichel und der Futsaft tropfte ihm von den Lippen. Er wischte sich
ab und meinte: »Jetzt wird sie gleich noch mehr schreien ...«
Damit schickte er sich an, sich auf Melanie zu legen.
Sie rief: »Schau dir jetzt seinen Schweif an.«
Ich glitt zu Leopold hin, der sich, auf Melanie liegend, bereitwillig so
hoch aufhob, daß ich bequem alles sehen konnte. Es war die längste
Stange, die ich je erblickt hatte, und sie war so gebogen wie eine
Extrawurst. In meiner Verwunderung griff ich danach und konnte mir's
nicht versagen, diesen Spargel so zu behandeln, wie man Spargel
behandelt, nämlich den Kopf in den Mund zu nehmen.
Leopold spielte mit Melanies Brüsten und ließ sie nicht merken, was ich
unten tat. Aber er zuckte so heftig und mit solcher Kraft, daß er mir
die Kinnladen auseinandertrieb.
Ich spielte mit der Zunge daran, rieb mit der Hand die übrig bleibende
Stange und wunderte mich jedesmal, wie weit der Weg war, den ich von der
Eichel bis zur Wurzel zurückzulegen hatte.
Da sagte Melanie: »Also, laß ihn jetzt vögeln, Pepi.«
Ich mußte ihn freigeben und schaute mir noch beneidend Melanies Fut an.
Ihre dicken, weißen Schenkel gingen in einen breiten, kugelrunden Popo
über, und wie eine schwarze Rose lag ihre Muschel auf den Polstern. Sie
stand weit offen und glänzte an ihren Rändern von Feuchtigkeit, und
sooft sie ihre Schamlippen zusammenzog, kam ein weißer Tropfen heraus
und hing wie eine Perle auf dem dunklen Haar.
»Pepi, Pepi«, rief sie, »schau jetzt, ob er hineingeht, wenn du's nicht
glaubst ...«
Schaun konnte ich nicht, aber greifen, und so suchte ich mit der Hand,
wie sein Anker sich immer tiefer und tiefer in den Grund bohrte, bis mir
nichts mehr in der Hand blieb als die beiden Spulen, auf denen sein Zaun
aufgestellt war.
Melanie stieß langanhaltende Schreie aus: »Hah ..., hah ..., haaah ...«
Dann schöpfte sie Atem und sagte: »Nur beim Leopold muß ich so
schreien ..., weil's mir ..., da immer kommt ..., hah ..., hah!«
Leopold vögelte wie eine Maschine. Sein Popo flog hoch in die Höhe und
senkte sich tief herab. Weil aber Melanie ihn mit ihren Beinen eng
umschlang, wurde sie mit hinauf- und heruntergerissen von jedem Stoß,
und das ganze Bett wackelte unter dieser Erschütterung. Ich kroch wieder
neben ihnen in die Höhe, bis ich mit meinem Popo auf dem Kopfpolster
saß. Und ich sah, wie Leopold beide Brüste so zusammenpreßte, daß die
Warzen ganz beieinander waren und sich berührten, und beide Warzen nahm
er auf einmal in den Mund. Ich hob meine Röcke auf und dachte, etwas
werde ich doch wohl abbekommen. Melanie bemerkte es und sagte: »Schleck
sie auch ...«
Leopold drehte sein Gesicht zu mir, ich bot ihm meine offene Muschel
dar, und sogleich begann er mit der Zunge einen Wirbel auf meinen
Kitzler zu schlagen, daß ich vor Wollust geschüttelt mich zurücklegte.
Leopold war ein Künstler. Er konnte seine Zunge beinahe so steif machen
wie seinen Spargel, und so stieß er mir sie in die Höhle, im selben Takt
und nach der Melodie, die er auf Melanies Fummel unten spielte. Ich
wußte gar nicht, was ich vor Wonne tun sollte und verhielt mich still,
bis es uns dreien zugleich kam.
Leopold verschwand sofort, und wir richteten uns noch zurecht, ehe wir
gleichfalls die Burschenstube verließen.
Am andern Morgen, nach diesem für mich so ereignisreichen Tage, ging ich
zur Kirche, um zu beichten.
Der Kooperator fragte mich: »Also, du hast Unkeuschheit getrieben mit
vielen Männern ...?«
»Ja«, sagte ich.
»Du hast dich vögeln lassen ...?«
»Ja ...«
»Du hast die männlichen Geschlechtsteile in den Mund genommen?«
»Ja ...«
»Du hast mit der Hand dran gespielt ...?«
»Ja ...«
»Hast du noch was getan?«
»Ja ...«
»Was?«
»Ich hab' mir's rückwärts hineinstecken lassen ...«
»Rückwärts ...?«
»Ja ...«
»Doch nicht ins Arschloch ...?«
»Ja, Hochwürden ...«
»Das hast du gestern vergessen ...«
»Hochwürden haben mich nicht gefragt ...«
Er dachte nach: »Da hab' ich leider selbst daran vergessen. Hast du noch
was getan?«
»Ja ...«
»Was denn noch ...?«
»Ich hab' mir die Fut ausschlecken lassen.«
Er sagte streng: »Das brauchst du nicht zu beichten, das war keine
Sünd ...«
»Hochwürden«, meinte ich, »ich mein' ja nicht Sie ..., es war wer
anderer ...«
Er herrschte mich an: »Du hast mir aber doch gesagt, daß dich niemand
mehr geschleckt hat ...«
»Nein«, sagte ich, »aber gestern nachmittag hat mir's noch jemand
getan ...«
»Wer denn?« Er war sehr erstaunt.
»Der Leopold ...«
»Wer ist denn das ...?«
»Der Zahlkellner von der Melanie ...«
»Ja, wieso denn?«
Ich beichtete alles.
Er schüttelte den Kopf: »Hast du noch was getan ..., vielleicht mit
weiblichen Geschlechtsteilen gespielt ...?«
»Ja ..., mit den Brüsten von der Melanie, und noch mit vielen
anderen ...«
»Und mit deinem Bruder hast du Blutschande getrieben?«
Ich wußte nicht, was er meinte, sagte aber »Ja«, um ihn nicht zu
erzürnen.
Er gab mir eine große Anzahl Vater unser, englischen Gruß und Glauben
als Buße zu beten auf, nachdem er mich noch gefragt hatte, ob ich meine
Sünden bereue, und nachdem ich dann das bejaht hatte.
Dann sagte er: »Geh hin und sündige nicht mehr, deine Sünden sind dir
vergeben. Bessere dich! Wenn du jedoch wieder in Sünde fällst, dann
verzweifle nicht, komme zu mir, und ich werde dich wieder reinigen. So
du aber irgendeiner Seele davon ein Wort verratest, ist dein ewiges
Seelenheil verloren, und du wirst in der Hölle vom Teufel auf glühenden
Kohlen gebraten werden.«
Ich verließ den Beichtstuhl mit leichtem Herzen.
In der Schule aber bemerkte ich einige Wochen lang, daß mich der
Katechet mit eigentümlichen Blicken ansah. Ich fürchtete mich vor ihm
und glaubte, er wolle mich besonders sekkieren.
Er spazierte zwischen den Bänken hin und her, und wie er bei mir
vorüberkam, legte er mir plötzlich die Hand auf das Haar, so sacht und
freundlich, daß ich bei dieser Berührung heftig zusammenschauderte. Er
streichelte mich noch am Rücken und sprach dabei zur Klasse weiter. Ich
fühlte mich sehr ausgezeichnet und blickte ihm liebevoll nach, als er
wieder seine Promenade fortsetzte.
In der nächsten Stunde prüfte er. Wir mußten die Fragen, die er gab,
aufschreiben, und eine war immer am Katheder oben, die Fragen zu
beantworten. Auch das mußten wir aufschreiben. Er rief zwei Mädchen auf,
und dann mich. Ich mußte auf sein Geheiß vor ihm stehen, mit dem Rücken
gegen den Lehrpult, das meine Unterseite den Blicken der Klasse verbarg.
Er saß, und ich stand zwischen seinen Beinen.
»Du hast gewiß recht brav gelernt?« meinte er und faßte mich bei der
Hand, aber so, daß die meinige sein Hosentürl berührte.
Ich ahnte nicht, daß er das beabsichtigt hatte.
Aber er bewegte meine Hand, daß sie wie zufällig an seinem Hosentürl
hin- und herfuhr. Jetzt fühlte ich, wie etwas Hartes darin zuckte.
Er schaute mich an. Dann legte er meine Hand ganz fest auf sein
Hosentürl, und ich konnte seinen Schwanz durch das Tuch fühlen.
Er ließ meine Hand frei, und ich zog sie nicht zurück.
Darauf sah er mich nochmals an, und jetzt wußte ich, was er wollte. Ich
war ganz aufgeregt vor Stolz und jäher Geilheit und griff zu, das heißt,
ich schloß leise meine Finger, so daß ich seinen Kolben jetzt, wenn auch
nur im Futeral, halb umschloß.
Er begann ein langes Diktat, das, wie ich merkte, nur den Zweck hatte,
die andern zu beschäftigen. Dabei schauten wir uns fortwährend in die
Augen, und auf einmal knöpfte er die Hose auf und seine Triebfeder
sprang nackt heraus.
Sie war ganz krumm wie die Nase des Katecheten, aber furchtbar dick und
brennend heiß.
Immer noch sahen wir uns an, und so begann ich leise, ganz leise zu
reiben, und seinen Bewegungen, damit niemand etwas merken solle, zu
folgen.
Er wurde blaß im Gesicht und behutsam fuhr er mir unter die Röcke, so
geschickt, daß niemand eine Bewegung an ihm wahrgenommen hätte.
Ich trat ein klein wenig mit den Füßen auseinander und schob den Bauch
vor, um ihm Zugang zu verschaffen.
Er fand sofort die richtigen Stellen und kitzelte mich so zart, daß es
mir heiß und kalt über den Rücken lief.
Aug in Aug standen wir.
Dabei sprach er immer weiter und weiter sein frommes Diktat.
Endlich ließ er mich los und schickte mich in die Bank.
Dann rief er die Ferdinger.
Sie trat auf's Katheder, und ich paßte von meinem Sitz verstohlen,
aber scharf auf. Ich sah, wie sie sich von selbst zwischen seine Beine
stellte, und weil sie ungeschickt war, merkte ich gleich, daß sie an
seinem Schwanz herumspielte und er an ihrer Muschel. Sie war ganz
erhitzt.
Gleich darauf rief er wieder mich.
»Bring dein Schreibheft mit ...«
Als ich bei ihm war, sagte er: »Du kannst hier schreiben.«
Ich drehte ihm den Rücken, beugte mich stehend über das Pult und wußte,
jetzt wird etwas anderes geschehen.
Und richtig, wie ich so vor ihm stand, und er hinter mir saß, hob er
langsam meine Kleider auf.
Ich wollte ihm behilflich sein und reckte ihm den Popo entgegen.
Immer weiter drückend suchte er mit seinem Schwanz, den er schon parat
hatte, meine Öffnung.
Auch dabei wollte ich ihm helfen und kam ihm mit ganz unmerklichen
Drehungen, so wie ich konnte, entgegen.
Wie er nun mit seinem Schwanzkopf an meinem Eingang angelangt war,
drückte er mich mit den Händen nieder und gab mir zu verstehen, ich
sollte mich draufsetzen.
Ich begriff die Situation, daß nämlich er ja nicht zustoßen konnte, ohne
sich zu verraten.
So ließ ich mich langsam auf seiner Stange nieder, daß sie so tief als
möglich eindrang, dann hob ich mich, ließ mich wieder nieder, und
verrichtete so für ihn das Geschäft des Stoßens.
Er beugte sich vor, als ob er mir beim Schreiben zuschauen wollte. Dabei
legte er die Hand flach auf den Tisch.
Auch das verstand ich, und mich fester an den Tisch beugend, legte ich
ihm meine Brust in die Hand, die er durch meine dünne Bluse sehr gut
durchfühlen konnte. Er preßte sie leise und streichelte unmerklich die
Warzen, die sich aufgerichtet hatten.
Mir war die Situation, die Anwesenheit so vieler Kinder, und der
Gedanke, daß der Katechet es war, der mich vögelte, der lange Zeit so
sehr gefürchtete Katechet, eine Ursache, meine Geilheit und meine
Aufregung zu vermehren. Dazu kam, daß ich mich nicht rühren durfte, daß
es nicht möglich war, sich zu mucksen, weil sonst alles verloren gewesen
wäre.
Ich rieb also seinen Klöppel in meinem Mörser hin und her, so gut ich
konnte. Nur als es mir kam, vermochte ich nicht ganz langsam zu bleiben,
sondern wurde vorsichtig ein wenig schneller und mutiger. Es tat mir
weh, denn sein Schwanz war sehr dick, und ich hatte es doch bei aller
Vorsicht so getrieben, daß er beinahe zur Hälfte in mir steckte. Er
machte meiner Schnelligkeit aber ein Ende, indem er mich mit der freien
Hand zum ruhigen Sitzen nötigte. So bohrte ich mir ihn nur so tief als
möglich hinein, ließ mir's kommen und schnappte dabei natürlich mit der
Fut so fest es ging zusammen.
Das mochte auch ihm den Saft in die Höhe treiben, denn plötzlich
sprudelte er so heiß hervor, daß es mir gleich ein zweitesmal kam. Er
diktierte ruhig immer weiter, während er spritzte. Ich hatte natürlich
kein Wort verstanden, noch geschrieben.
Als er ausgespritzt war, glitschte er von selbst heraus. Dann spürte
ich, wie er mir das Kleid in Ordnung brachte und hörte ihn sagen: »Du
kannst in die Bank gehen.«
Gleich darauf war die Stunde aus.
Als wir aus der Schule gingen, kamen die Ferdinger und die Melanie zu
mir.
»Heut hat dich der Katechet gevögelt ...«, sagte sie mir.
»Habt ihr was gesehen?« fragte ich sie.
»Nein, aber das heißt ja ...«, lachte die Ferdinger.
Und Melanie meinte: »Das kennen wir schon ...«
»Mich hat er noch nie gevögelt ...«, sagte die Ferdinger, »ich hab' ihm
immer nur einen herunterg'rissen.«
Sie war ein hageres, unschönes Ding. Nur zwei kleine, spitze Brüste
fielen an ihr auf, weil sie so frech aus ihren Kleidern hervorstachen,
und ihr breites Untergestell.
»Mich pudert er schon seit vorigem Jahr«, meinte Melanie.
Jetzt war offenbar ich an der Reihe.
Er behielt mich auch einmal nach der Schule da.
Kaum hatten die Mädchen das Lehrzimmer verlassen, als er mich auf das
Podium rief. Ohne ein Wort zu sagen, gab er mir seinen Schwanz in die
Hand, und ich bemühte mich, ihn zufriedenzustellen, jetzt, da ich mich
in meinen Bewegungen nicht zu genieren hatte.
Nachdem er sich sein Bajonett so lange hatte putzen lassen, bis er
glaubte, daß es nun blank genug sei, und nachdem er mir mit den Fingern
die Scheide ausgewischt hatte, damit es dann nicht wieder staubig werde,
ließ er mich auf sich reiten.
Es war sehr gut, wie er das machte. Mit der einen Hand, die er auf
meinen Rücken legte, preßte er mich an sich, mit der andern Hand fuhr er
mir auf der Brust herum, und dabei küßte er mich so sanft und zärtlich
auf den Mund, daß ich ganz gerührt davon wurde.
Und weil er sich jetzt vor niemanden mehr zu verbergen brauchte, bekam
ich seine Stöße zu spüren, die mir schier das Kreuz brachen. In fünf
Minuten war alles vorüber. Er ließ seine Fontäne springen, und ich zog
meine Schleuße auf. Dann konnte ich nach Hause gehen.
Mit diesem Katecheten passierte etwas, was mir in der Erinnerung oft
leid tat, denn ich hatte ihn gern.
In einer der untern Klassen war ein kleines Mädchen von auffallender
Schönheit. Sie war die Tochter eines Bauarbeiters und etwa acht Jahre
alt. Sie war selbst für ihr Alter klein, aber sehr breit, und hatte ein
blühendes Engelsgesicht. Rote Wangen und blonde Locken. Aber sie war
beinahe so breit als sie hoch war, ungewöhnlich fleischig und hatte
schon Ansätze von Busen.
Dieses Mädchen nun hatte der gute Katechet vorgenommen, hatte ihm auf
dem Katheder das Bajonett putzen, den Klöppel schwingen, den Spargel
putzen gelernt, und hatte seine kleine, nackte, fleischige Vogelschale
mit dem besten Männerschaum gefüllt.
Die Kleine mochte das für ein angenehmes Kinderspiel gehalten haben,
kurz, sie erzählte es ihrer Mutter, diese wieder machte ein großes
Geschrei und beichtete diese Schaudermär ihrem Gatten, und der Gatte
wieder, der ohnehin eine Wut auf die Pfaffen hatte, lief zur Polizei.
Eine Untersuchung wurde eingeleitet. Mein armer Katechet wurde
verhaftet, und alsbald wurde auch in der Schule Umfrage nach den anderen
Opfern gehalten.
Die Kinder zeigten sich gegenseitig an, und eines Tages bekam auch mein
Vater eine Vorladung, mit mir auf dem Kommissariat zu erscheinen.
Als wir hinkamen, war eine ganze Versammlung von Kindern da, mit ihren
Müttern und Vätern. Die Großen legten sich keinen Zwang vor uns auf und
klagten einander ihr Leid.
Mein Vater erfuhr erst hier, was los sei, war aber ganz still und fragte
mich nur, ob es wahr sei.
Ich gab ihm keine Antwort, ich schämte mich.
Man erfuhr eine Menge Geschichten vom Herrn Katecheten. Da waren auch
ganz kleine Kinder aus der ersten Klasse, die auf Befragen erzählten,
der Herr Katechet habe ihnen seinen Pipihahn in den Mund gegeben und
habe dann Wiwi gemacht. Die Entrüstung war groß.
Melanie war mit ihrem Vater da, der aber die Geschichte sehr ruhig nahm,
und seiner Tochter, wenn sie erzählen wollte, immer nur »Halt's Maul«
zuschrie. Die Leute sahen sie an und meinten, bei ihr sei es kein
Wunder, denn sie sei ja eigentlich gar kein Kind mehr, sondern schon
eine erwachsene Person.
Endlich wurden wir vor den Kommissär gerufen. Es war noch ein Herr da,
ein Arzt, wie sich später zeigte.
Der Kommissär, ein junger hübscher Mensch, hatte immer Mühe, sein Lachen
zu verbeißen. Ich aber zitterte vor Angst.
Er fragte mich: »Hat dir der Katechet etwas getan ...?«
»Nein«, sagte ich, »getan hat er mir nichts ...«
»Ich meine, ob er dich angerührt hat ..., du weißt schon wie ...?«
»Ja ...«
»Wo hat er dich angerührt ...?«
»Da ...« Ich zeigte schüchtern auf mein Mittelstück.
»Und was hat er noch getan ...?«
»Nichts ...«
»Hat er dir nichts in die Hand gegeben ...?«
»Ja ...«
»Na also ..., was denn?«
Ich schwieg.
»Na, ich weiß schon«, sagte der Kommissär. »Und hat er das Dingsda ...,
hat er das vielleicht dorthin auch gegeben ...?« Er deutete auf meine
Eingangsstelle.
»Ja ...«
»Ganz hinein ...?«
»Nein, nicht ganz ...«
»Also nur ein bisserl ...?«
»Ja ..., die Hälfte ...«
Der Kommissär lachte laut auf, der Doktor lachte. Mein Vater sah mich an
und schwieg.
»Wo hat er dich noch angerührt ...?«
»Da ...« Ich zeigte auf meine Brust. »Na.« Der Kommissär blickte
zweifelhaft hin, »ich weiß nicht«, sagte er zum Arzt, »ich weiß nicht,
Herr Doktor ..., ob da ein Anlaß für ihn war.« Der Arzt kam auf mich zu,
packte mich geschäftsmäßig an den Brüsten, griff daran herum und meinte
dann: »Oh, genug ..., ganz genug.«
Mein Vater schaute verwundert auf meinen Busen.
»Na, und sag mir einmal«, fragte der Kommissär weiter, »hast du dich
nicht gewehrt?«
»Was, bitte ...?«
»Ich meine, hast du ihm nicht die Hand weggestoßen?«
»Nein.«
»Und warum hast du denn eigentlich seinen ..., sein Dingsda
angegriffen?«
»Weil's der Herr Katechet gewollt hat ...«
»So ..., so ..., aber gezwungen hat er dich nicht ...?«
Zögernd erwiderte ich: »Nein ...« Aber ich merkte, daß die Frage für
mich gefährlich sei.
»Also warum hast du dir denn das alles tun lassen ...?«
»So, weil der Herr Katechet gewollt hat ...«
»Ja, warum hast du denn nicht gesagt, bitte Herr Katechet, das mag ich
nicht ...?«
»Weil ich mich nicht getraut hab' ...«
»Also aus Respekt und aus Angst vor dem Herrn Katecheten ...?«
»Ja«, rief ich erleichtert, »aus Angst ...«
Aber der Kommissär ließ nicht nach: »Sag mir, und hast du ihm keinen
Anlaß gegeben ..., hast du nie gesagt: `ich will's machen ...´, oder ihn
so angeschaut ..., so ...?« Der Kommissär machte verliebte Augen.
Ich mußte in all meiner Angst lächeln, aber ich sagte »Nein«.
»Und jetzt ...«, fuhr der Kommissär fort, »jetzt sag mir noch eins, aber
die reine Wahrheit, verstehst du! Die reine Wahrheit ..., war dir das,
was dir der Herr Katechet getan hat, angenehm ...?«
Ich schwieg voll Angst.
»Ich meine«, wiederholte er, »hast du gern mit seinem, mit dem Dingsda
gespielt?«
»O nein!« beteuerte ich eifrig.
»Oder, -- aber ich will die Wahrheit wissen ...«, sprach er weiter,
»oder wenn er dir das Dingsda hineingesteckt hat, war dir das angenehm,
oder hat's dir weh getan ...?«
»Weh hat's mir manchmal getan, aber nicht immer«, gab ich zu.
»Also manchmal hat's auch wohlgetan ...?« forschte er scharfen Tones.
»Ja«, platzte ich heraus, »manchmal ...«, und stotternd fügte ich hinzu,
»aber nur ..., selten ...«
Der Kommissär lächelte, mein Vater sah mich erstaunt und zornig an.
»Also weiter, Kleine«, setzte der Kommissär fort, »es hat dir wohlgetan,
und du hast's also gern gemacht ..., was?«
»Nein«, widersprach ich, aus Furcht vor meinem Vater, »ich hab's nicht
gern gemacht ...«
»Ja, aber du sagst ja doch selbst, daß dir's wohl getan hat ...?«
»Da kann ich nichts dafür ...«, rief ich aus, »wenn das so hin und
her ...«
Er unterbrach mich: »Schon gut, schon gut ... Du hast es also nicht gern
gemacht und es war dir nur unwillkürlich angenehm ..., was?«
»Ja«, nickte ich.
»Bitte, Herr Doktor«, wandte sich der Kommissär an den Arzt, »wollen Sie
die Sache konstatieren ...«
Ich wußte nicht, was geschehen solle, als der Arzt mich aufforderte,
mich auf einen erhöhten Stuhl zu setzen. Er schlug mir die Röcke in die
Höhe, griff mir an die Fut, und spreizte sie mit den Fingern, dann
spürte ich, wie er etwas Hartes hineinsteckte, und zog es dann wieder
heraus.
»Die Sache stimmt«, sagte er. »Das Kind hat Verkehr gehabt mit ihm.«
Verwirrt und verlegen stieg ich wieder herab.
»Sag mir jetzt«, meinte der Kommissär, »ist es dir bekannt, ob der
Katechet es mit anderen Mädchen auch so gemacht hat?«
»Es sind ja so viele draußen im Vorzimmer ...«, erwiderte ich.
Er lachte wieder: »Das weiß ich schon, du sollst mir nur sagen, ob du
selbst was gehört oder gesehen hast ...?«
»Ja«, entgegnete ich. »Die Melanie Hofer und die Ferdinger, die haben's
mir selber gesagt.«
»Und hat er es mit ihnen auch so gemacht wie mit dir ...?«
»Nein«, sagte ich lebhaft, »die Ferdinger hat er nicht gevögelt ...«
Der Kommissär sagte: »Kennst du das Wort vom Katecheten?«
Ich war verlegen: »Nein, von ihm nicht ...«
»Von wem denn?« wollte er wissen.
»Ach nur so ..., aus der Schule ..., von den anderen ...«
»Von der Hofer oder von der Ferdinger ...?«
»Nein ...«
»Von wem denn?«
»Ich weiß nicht mehr ...«
»Also du sagst, die Ferdinger hat er nicht gevögelt ...?«
»Nein ..., mit der hat er sich nur gespielt ...«
»Aber die Hofer ...«
»Ja ..., die hat er oft gevögelt ...«
»Hast du's gesehen?«
»Ja, einmal hab' ich's gesehen ...«
»Und die andernmale ...?«
»Na, sie hat mir's erzählt ...«
»Herr Mutzelbecher«, sagte der Kommissär zu meinem Vater im ernsten Ton,
»es tut mir leid, daß Sie so Trauriges haben hören müssen. Es ist sehr
beklagenswert, daß ein gewissenloser und verirrter Priester Ihrer
Tochter die Unschuld genommen hat, aber trösten Sie sich, die Kleine ist
jung, niemand wird etwas davon erfahren und durch eine streng moralische
Erziehung können Sie böse Folgen hoffentlich verhindern.«
Wir gingen nach Hause. Ich war in diesem Moment überzeugt, daß der
Katechet mir meine Unschuld genommen hat. Er ist zu einer schweren
Strafe verurteilt worden, und es wurde ihm besonders hart angerechnet,
daß er Melanie und mich verführt hatte. Wenn ich bedenke, daß an uns
nichts mehr zu verderben war und daß er gewiß bei noch vielen anderen
Mädchen nicht der erste gewesen ist, der ihnen einen Schwanz zu spielen
gab, tut er mir herzlich leid.
Die Geschichte mit dem Katecheten ist aber für mein ganzes Leben
entscheidend geworden, wie ich im weiteren Verlaufe der Begebenheiten
zeigen werde. Denn trotz dieser Kindergeschichten wäre ich vielleicht
eine brave Frau geworden, wie Melanie es wurde, die heute mit einer
Schar von Kindern im Gasthaus ihres Vaters sitzt, oder wie manche andere
von meinen damaligen Genossinnen, denen diese frühzeitigen
Ausschreitungen nichts geschadet haben.
Sie hielten sich, als das Jungfrauengefühl in ihnen erwachte, und als
besonders die Angst vor dem Kinderkriegen sich einstellte, vom
Geschlechtsverkehr zurück, wurden keusch, wurden dann von einem
ernsthaften Geliebten, der nichts ahnte, wie viele Wenzel schon an
dieser Stelle gewetzt hatten, ernsthaft entjungfert, wurden geheiratet
und sind, wenn sie auch hie und da einer Versuchung nicht widerstehen
konnten, wie meine Mutter, doch keine Hure geworden wie ich.
Nur die Ereignisse, von denen ich jetzt berichten werde, haben mich zur
Dirne gemacht, nur sie sind Veranlassung gewesen, daß ich den Weg ging,
den man den »Weg des Lasters« nennt. Ich bereue es nicht, diesen Weg
gegangen zu sein. Das habe ich schon gesagt und wiederhole es. Mir tut
höchstens die Ursache leid, aber nicht die Wirkung.
Sonst aber, und auch das muß ich hier, um der Wahrheit die Ehre zu
geben, wiederholt feststellen, sonst aber führen Tausende und Tausende
von Mädchen aus den unteren, ja selbst -- wie ich heute weiß -- aus den
besten Gesellschaftsschichten in ihrer Kindheit ein so geschlechtliches
Dasein, treiben ahnungslos, verführt von ihren Gespielen und
Gespielinnen, alle erdenkliche Unzucht und werden später sittsame,
keusche und anständige Mädchen, Frauen und Mütter, die sich ihrer
Kinderfehler gar nicht erinnern.
Meine Brüder waren in die Lehre gekommen. Lorenz, der älteste, in
dasselbe Geschäft, in dem mein Vater arbeitete. Franz zu einem
Buchbinder. Ich sah sie nur mehr an Sonntagnachmittagen. Lorenz sprach
fast gar nicht mehr mit mir. Franz erzählte mir, er habe bei seinem
Meister ein junges Dienstmädchen vom Land, das sich von ihm vögeln lasse
und bei dem er in der Nacht schlafen könne.
Wir hielten einen stillen alten Mann als Bettgeher, der früh das Haus
verließ, und spät abends heimkehrte. Ich schlief auf dem Sofa im Zimmer.
Das Bett der Mutter stand leer neben dem meines Vaters.
Einen Tag, nachdem wir beim Kommissär waren, sagte mein Vater zu mir:
»Ich wollte dich eigentlich recht fest durchhauen, weil du so ein
Saumensch bist ...«
Es war das einzige, was ich über den Fall von ihm gehört hatte. Ich
erschrak und meinte: »Aber ich kann doch nichts dafür ...«
»Na ja«, brummte er, »ist eigentlich wahr ..., so ein Schweinkerl ...«
Nach einer Weile sagte er: »Geschehen ist geschehen ...«
Und wieder nach einer Weile: »Jetzt werd' ich aber aufpassen auf dich,
verstehst ...? Du gehst mir nirgends hin, ohne Erlaubnis ..., und ...,
und ...«, er stockte, dann rief er heftig: »Und von heut ab schlafst du
da ...« Er deutete auf das Bett der Mutter.
Ich war erstaunt, und er setzte hinzu: »Es sind immer Bettgeher da ...,
man kann nicht wissen ..., ich will aufpassen ...«
So schlief ich von diesem Abend Bett an Bett mit meinem Vater.
Als er vom Wirtshaus nach Hause kam, war es vielleicht schon elf Uhr,
und ich wachte nicht auf.
Erst als er vielemale geflüstert hatte: »Bist du da ...? Hörst ..., bist
du da ...?« erwachte ich, und schlaftrunken antwortete ich: »Ja,
Vater ...«
»Wo bist du?«
»Da, Vater, da bin ich ...«, sagte ich vom Schlafe befangen.
Er tastete nach mir: »Ah, ja ..., da bist du ...«
Und er fuhr mir vom Hals zur Brust herunter. Mir gab es einen Schlag,
als er nach meinem Busen griff, ihn in die Hand nahm und abfühlte. Ich
lag ganz still.
»Alsdann ..., da ...«, murmelte er stockend, »alsdann da hat er dich
angegriffen, der Herr Katechet ...?«
»Ja, Vater ...«, flüsterte ich.
»Da auch?« Er packte meine andere Brust.
»Ja, Vater ...«
»So ein Schuft«, redete er weiter, »so ein Hund ..., das könnt' ihm
passen ...«, aber dabei spielte er mit meiner Brustwarze.
»Wie hat er's denn gemacht ...?« frug er zu mir herüber.
»So wie der Vater ...«, sagte ich leise.
Er fuhr mir unters Hemd und faßte mich an der Fut, wühlte mit den
Fingern in den Haaren herum und flüsterte: »Pepi ...?«
Ich war starr vor Schrecken und Erregung.
»Ja, Vater ...«
»Pepi ..., da ist er auch gewesen ...?«
»Ja, Vater ..., da auch ...«
»Mit seiner Nudl, vielleicht gar ...?«
Ich staunte über diese Frage. Der Vater wußte doch alles, hatte er es
vergessen? Oder fragte er mit Absicht?
Er wiederholte: »Sag ..., mit seiner Nudl ist er dagewesen ...?«
»Ja ..., Vater ...«
»Da drinn?« Er versuchte meine Spalte zu öffnen und mir den Finger
hineinzustecken. Ich stieß seine Hand fort.
»Aber Vater ...«, sagte ich.
»Ich will's wissen ...«, zischelte er mir zu, und faßte mich wieder dort
an.
»Aber Vater«, bat ich, »was tun S' denn Vater ...?« Sein Finger saß mir
im Loch. »Vater, Vater ..., hören S' auf«, flüsterte ich ihm zu, »Sie
wissen ja ..., er ist drinn g'wesen ..., ja ..., hör'n S' auf ...«
»Hat er dich gevögelt ...?« Der Finger bohrte weiter.
»Ja«, sagte ich schnell, »er hat mich halt gevögelt ..., ich kann ja nix
dafür ...«
»Das ist dein Glück ...«, brummte mein Vater, ließ mich los, drehte sich
um und schlief ein.
Ein paar Nächte lag ich ruhig neben ihm im Bett; er faßte mich nicht an,
und ich vergaß ganz, was vorgefallen war, oder wenn ich daran dachte,
schrieb ich dieses sonderbare Benehmen der Wut zu, die mein Vater wegen
des Katecheten haben mochte.
Am Samstag waren wir im Gasthaus gewesen, und als wir uns niedergelegt
hatten, griff der Vater wieder zu mir herüber.
»Du«, sagte er, indem er meinen Busen suchte.
»Du ...«
»Ja, Vater ...«
»Du, wie oft ..., wie oft hat dich der Katechet gevögelt ..., ha ...?«
»Ich weiß nicht mehr, Vater ...«
»Na, wie oft ...?«
»Wenn ich's aber nicht weiß ...«
»Du! Ich will's wissen.« Er hatte meine Brust erwischt und quetschte
sie, daß ich schrie.
»Aber, Vater ...«
»Wie oft ...?«
»Vielleicht zehnmal ...«
»So? Zehnmal gar ...?«
Er spielte an meiner Warze, die sich aufrichtete.
»Zehnmal«, fragte er, »auf einmal?«
Ich mußte lächeln. »Aber nein ..., jedesmal einmal ...«
»Also zehnmal ...?«
Und er fingerte meine Brustwarze, daß sie höher und höher wurde. Ich
hatte ein Gefühl von Neugierde, Wohlsein, Geilheit und Scheu, und die
Scheu überwog noch, deshalb nahm ich seine Hand und drückte sie mehr von
mir fort.
»Gehn S', hören S' auf, Vater, was machen S' denn?«
»Nix, nix ...«, brummte er und zog sich zurück.
Wieder war ein paar Tage Ruhe. Ich schlief meistens schon, wenn der
Vater nach Hause kam. Daß er etwas anderes von mir wollte, fiel mir
nicht ein. Ich glaubte nur, er könne sich über den Katecheten nicht
beruhigen.
Da fing er wieder eines Abends an. Wir hatten uns gleichzeitig zu Bett
gelegt, und während er nach mir tastete, fragte er: »Was hast denn
g'macht heut den ganzen Tag?«
»Nichts, Vater ...«, antwortete ich.
Er fuhr mir schon in den Hemdausschnitt und ich hielt mir die Hände vor
der Brust.
»Warst in der Schul?«
»Ja.«
Er versuchte meine Hände zu verdrängen, um meine Brüste zu erreichen.
»Hast einen neuen Katecheten?«
»Ja, Vater ...«
»Na ..., tatschelt der dich auch so ab ...?« Er hatte meine Brust
erwischt und spielte mit ihr ...
»Nein, Vater ...«
»Und der Herr Lehrer ...?«
»Wir haben ja eine Lehrerin, Vater ...«
»So? Und der Katechet tut nix ...?«
Ich versuchte es ihn fortzudrängen. »Nein ..., nichts tut er ...«
Er ließ meine Brust los und griff mir zwischen die Beine, so schnell,
daß ich sie nicht schließen konnte, und so hielt er meine warme Muschel
ganz in der Hand.
»Bitt' Sie, Vater ..., Vater ...«, ich atmete schon schwer, denn er
kitzelte meine Geilheit wach, »bitt' schön ..., Vater ..., nicht ...«
»Weißt du ...«, stammelte er ..., »weißt du ..., wenn vielleicht der
neue Katechet ..., so mit dir zum Spielen anfangt ...«, er ließ ein
wahres Trommeln auf meinen Kitzler los, »oder wenn er gar so was machen
will ...«, damit probiert er mir den Finger hineinzustecken, »dann laß
dir's nicht gefallen ...«
»Nein, Vater ..., nein ..., aber gehen S' fort ...« Ich schloß die
Beine, machte einen Schneller mit dem Popo, und war frei.
»Na ..., na«, meinte er, »ist schon recht ...«
Noch immer ahnte ich nichts. Aber ich hatte nur vor mir selbst Angst.
Diese Berührungen regten mich auf. Der Wunsch, gevögelt zu werden, seine
Betastungen zu erwidern, die Begierde nach seinem Schweif zu langen,
durchzuckte und erschreckte mich. Ich meinte, er werde mich halb
totschlagen, wenn ich mich unterstehen würde, so was merken zu lassen.
Ich glaubte, er wolle mich prüfen.
Aber wieder ein paar Nächte später, wachte ich auf. Ich hatte tief
geschlafen und erwachte unter seinen Berührungen. Er lag dicht neben
mir, hatte meine Brust entblößt, und spielte mit den Warzen. Er spielte
so leise, so zart, daß sie beide hoch und steif emporstanden. Ich
stellte mich schlafend, und eine ungeheure Neugierde erfüllte mich, was
er mit mir anfangen werde. Jetzt ahnte ich ja, worauf er hinaus wollte.
Doch ich schämte mich zu sehr, und war außerdem nicht ganz sicher, ob
das nicht eine neue Prüfung sei. Ich lag ganz still.
Da faßte er meine linke Brust und begann meine Himbeere zu küssen und zu
lecken.
Unwillkürlich fuhr ein Zucken durch meinen Körper. Aber ich atmete tief
und tat so, als ob ich fest schliefe. Er leckte wieder, sog daran,
preßte meine beiden Duteln, und wenn mich das Zucken schüttelte, hörte
er auf. Da glaubte ich, er wolle sehen, ob ich wach sei, und stellte
mich erst recht, als ob ich schlafe.
Auf einmal hob er die Decke und streifte mir das Hemd in die Höhe. Mein
Herz begann vor Angst und Geilheit laut zu pochen, denn noch immer
glaubte ich an eine Art von Prüfung. Es war eine unbestimmte, dumpfe
Vorstellung, die mich neben meiner sinnlichen Erregung beherrschte.
Behutsam, leise schob er, im Bett neben mir sitzend, meine Füße
auseinander. Ich ließ es willenlos geschehen. Als er mir aber mit der
Hand über die Spalte strich, mußte ich damit zucken, und da hörte er
wieder auf. Ich imitierte, wie von nichts zu wissen, ein leises
Schnarchen.
Da schwang er sich zwischen meine Beine, und in den Armen aufgestützt,
lag er über mir, ohne mich anders als mit der Schwanzspitze zu berühren.
Ich konnte mich nicht halten vor Geilheit, und wetzte auf und nieder,
als er mir mit dem heißen Schweif leise gegen die Fut stieß. Dabei fuhr
ich mit dem Schnarchen fort.
Er hielt seinen Schweif nur außen in die äußere Muschelöffnung, rieb ihn
dort leise hin und her und regte mich furchtbar auf. Ich erwartete, ich
hoffte jeden Moment, er werde ihn nun endlich hineinstecken, ich war
halb von Sinnen. Da entlud er sich. Ich wurde in meinen Haaren und auf
meinem Bauch von der warmen Flut übergossen, und gleich darauf zog er
sich von mir zurück, leise, vorsichtig, damit ich nicht erwache.
Jetzt erst wußte ich genau, was mein Vater mit mir für Absichten hatte.
Und ich muß gestehen, so peinlich mir heute der Gedanke daran ist, so
wenig verletzte er mich damals. Ich dachte weder, ob es recht noch ob es
unrecht sei. Es erschien mir angenehm. Ich kam mir erwachsen vor. Ich
hatte so eine dunkle Vorstellung, als brauche ich meinen Vater von nun
ab nicht mehr zu fürchten, ja als sei mir alles erlaubt.
Die folgende Nacht schlief ich nicht, sondern stellte mich nur so.
Richtig. Mein Vater paßte auf, ob ich schon eingeschlafen sei. Als ich
tief zu atmen anfing, kam er herbei. Diesmal hob er gleich die Decke und
legte sich neben mich, dann hüllte er uns beide ein. Zuerst lag er still
an mich gepreßt, vielmehr an meinen Schenkel, denn ich lag auf dem
Rücken. Und er schob mein Hemd leise hinauf, so daß ich an dieser Seite
seinen Stachel sich langsam aufrichten fühlte. Er schob mein Hemd höher
und höher, bis dicht unter meinen Hals hinauf. Dann fing er wieder das
Spiel mit meinen Brüsten an und küßte und saugte die Warzen, daß mich
das Verlangen nur so schüttelte. Ich bedachte, daß er wieder nur von
außen anklopfen und ich dabei leer ausgehen würde. Trotzdem wagte ich es
nicht, meine Schlafpose aufzugeben.
Seine Hand glitt abwärts. Wieder schob er mir die Beine auseinander. Es
ward ihm leicht, denn ein wenig hatte ich sie schon unwillkürlich von
selbst gespreizt. Als er mich mit den Fingern berührte, hielt ich mich
nicht zurück und begann, mit dem Popo ein wenig zu tanzen. Ich hatte es
ja die Nacht vorher erfahren, daß er dennoch glaubte, ich schliefe.
Er wurde durch meine Bewegung so in Aufregung versetzt, daß er mich
sofort bestieg, und kaum fühlte ich seinen Hausmeister mit heißem Kopf
den Eingang suchen, als ich von meiner Geilheit überwältigt, schwerer zu
stoßen anhub und mich bemühte, durch geschicktes Entgegenhalten seinen
Einschlupf herbeizuführen. Hatte ihn die Aufregung unbedenklich gemacht,
oder mochte er glauben, mein Schlaf sei so fest genug, auch er begann
heftiger zu stoßen, als die Nacht vorher. Ich erwiderte jeden Stoß.
Bajonett und Scheide bemühten sich zusammen zu kommen, und auf einmal
stak er bei mir so tief als möglich.
Ohne es zu achten, rief ich: »Ach ...«
Er lag still und hielt seinen Schweif fest in mich hineingepreßt.
Aber ich hatte doch jetzt das Bewußtsein, daß ich mich nicht habe zu
fürchten brauchen, und redete ihn an, als sei ich eben erwacht.
»Vater ..., was tun Sie denn ...?« Dabei machte ich ein paar ganz leise
Stöße.
Er erschrak, vermochte aber nicht mich zu verlassen.
»Vater ...«, flüsterte ich, »um Gottes willen, ..., was machen Sie ...,
gehn S' fort ..., Vater ..., gehen S' fort ..., was tun S' denn da?« und
während ich das sagte, wurden meine Stöße stärker.
»Nix tu' ich ...«, flüsterte er, »nix ..., ich hab' ..., ich hab' ...
geschlafen.«
»Also Vater ..., was machen wir denn?«
»Ich hab's nicht gewußt, daß du's bist ...«
Ich merkte die Ausrede und erwiderte: »Ja, ich bin's ..., ich bin's
Vater ..., ich ...« Mit jedem »ich bin's« aber mußte ich, von seinem
Stiel gereizt, einen heftigen Stoß tun.
»Vater ...«, sagte ich weiter, da er schwieg, »Vater ..., Sie vögeln
mich ja ...« Und ich umarmte ihn.
Er lag jetzt ganz auf mir, packte mich bei den Brüsten, und ohne mir zu
antworten, begann er regelrecht und ungeniert zu stoßen.
Ich hielt ihn fest umschlungen und flüsterte ihm ins Ohr:
»Das ist ja eine Sünd ..., Vater ..., ich fürcht' mich ..., ach ...,
Vater ..., ach fester ..., fester ..., ach ... so ist's gut ..., aber
ich fürcht' mich ...«
»Macht nix«, gab er zurück, »es weiß ja niemand was ..., und es wird ja
niemand was wissen ...«
»Nein ...«, stimmte ich bei, »nein ..., ich sag' nix ...«
Er stieß heftiger zu. »So ist recht ..., brav bist du ..., brav ...«
Ich fragte keck: »Vater ..., ist's gut ...?«
»Ja ..., ja ..., ja ...«, und er suchte mit dem Mund meine Brust.
»Wann der Vater will ...«, flüsterte ich, »lass' ich mich immer von
Ihnen vögeln ...«
»Sei ruhig ..., ja ..., ich will ...«
»Vater, mir kommt's ..., fester ..., fester ..., ach ..., so ...!«
Ich war selig, denn so lang hatte ich darauf gewartet, und jetzt schien
mir alles gestattet zu sein.
»Vater, kommt's Ihnen auch ...?«
»Ja, jetzt ..., jetzt ..., Pepi ..., jetzt ..., ach das ist gut ...«
Wir opferten beide zu gleicher Zeit und schliefen Arm in Arm ein.
Am nächsten Tag war mein Vater sehr schüchtern wie noch nie. Er sprach
nur in leisem Ton zu mir und mit abgewendetem Antlitz. Ich wich ihm aus
und wartete auf den Abend.
Als wir im Bett lagen, kroch ich zu ihm.
»Vater ...«, flüsterte ich, »sind Sie bös ...?« Ich nahm seine Hand und
legte sie an meine nackte Brust.
»Nein ...«, antwortete er, »ich bin nicht bös ...«
»Weil S' heut nix mit mir gesprochen haben ...«
»Ach ..., ich hab' nur nachgedacht ...«, meinte er.
»Was denn? Vater ...«
»Na, ich mein' ...« entgegnete er, während er meine Brüste, die sich
über ihn neigten, streichelte, »ich mein', wenn der schäbige Katechet
das hat machen dürfen, dann ist sowieso alles eins ...«
Ich fuhr unter die Decke, haschte seinen Schweif, der sich sofort
aufrichtete, wie ein Soldat auf den Alarmruf in die Höhe springt.
»Vater ..., wenn Sie wieder wollen ..., ich lass' mich ...«
»In Gottes Namen«, keuchte er.
Und da bestieg ich ihn rittlings und pflanzte mir den Stützbalken ein.
Er hielt mich bei den Brüsten fest, und so machten wir es in wenigen
Minuten zu Ende.
Jetzt war mein Vater auch bei Tag freundlich zu mir. Wenn ich ihm ein
Glas Wasser reichte oder er sonst an mir vorüberging, faßte er mich bei
der Brust, und ich wühlte rasch ein bißchen an seiner Hose herum.
Er sprach auch vom Geschäft mit mir, von allen möglichen Angelegenheiten
des Haushaltes, von seinen Geldsorgen. Dabei kaufte er mir an Kleidern,
was ich mir nur wünschte und was er konnte, ließ mich den Zins vom
Bettgeher einheben, kurz ich kam mir sehr erwachsen und wichtig vor.
Einmal fragte ich ihn: »Erinnern Sie sich, Vater, was ich dem Herrn
Katecheten noch hab' tun müssen?«
Es war in der Nacht, und wir hatten gerade eine schöne Leistung, aber
freilich eine einzige hinter uns.
»Nein«, sagte er, »was denn?«
»Soll ich's Ihnen zeigen?«
»Ja ..., da wär' ich neugierig ...«
Ich nahm seinen weich gewordenen Pendel, schob meinen Kopf herunter und
führte ihn mir in den Mund. »Ist das gut ...?«
»Ja ..., gut ist das ..., ach ..., mach's nur weiter ..., nur
weiter ...«
Ich arbeitete mit meiner ganzen Routine, bis er den Flaggenmast wieder
aufrichtete. Dann ließ ich los.
»Vater ..., der Katechet hat's mir aber auch so gemacht ...«, log ich.
Mir war's ja egal. Katechet oder nicht, den Kooperator durfte ich ja
wohl verschweigen.
»Willst du's von mir auch haben ...?« fragte er mich.
»Ja ...«
Er faßte mich um die Mitte, warf mich in mein Bett herüber und war
sogleich mit dem Kopf zwischen meinen Beinen. Und nun begann er meine
Diele zu scheuern, daß mir der Atem verging.
Im nächsten Moment aber unterbrach er sich und begann mich zu vögeln.
Mir war das eine, wie das andere recht, weshalb ich mit meiner
Begeisterung nicht zurückhielt.
In dieser Zeit wechselten unsere Bettgeher, und der jetzt kam, war ein
Kaffeehauskellner. Er servierte in einem jener kleinen anrüchigen
Lokale, die man Tschecherl nennt. Um drei Uhr früh kam er nach Hause,
schlief bis um zwölf Uhr Mittag und ging von uns wieder an seine Arbeit.
Es war ein ausgemergelter Kerl mit einem gelben Gesicht, tiefliegenden
schwarzen Augen und mit der großen »Sechser«-Frisur, wie sie damals als
nobel galt. Obwohl er vielleicht schon sechsunddreißig Jahre zählte,
hatte er doch nur vier bis sechs kümmerliche Lippenhärchen, die den
Schnurrbart vorstellten.
Mir war er höchst unsympathisch, und als er mir in den ersten Tagen
gleich an die Brüste griff, schlug ich ihm auf die Hand und stieß ihn
vor die Brust.
Er sah mich scheel an und ließ von mir ab.
Doch ein paar Tage später faßte er mich, während ich in der Küche zu tun
hatte, plötzlich von rückwärts, hielt mich an sich gepreßt und
bearbeitete meine Brüste, daß ich fürchtete, die Warzen werden mir
aufstehen.
Wütend schlug ich um mich, stieß nach hinten mit den Füßen aus, und er
mußte mich freigeben. Aber er sagte bös: »Na, na ..., darf man das
Fräulein nur anrühren, wenn man ein Katechet ist ...?«
Ich war sprachlos vor Staunen. Trotzdem faßte ich mich und schrie ihn
an:
»Halten S' das Maul ...«
»Schön ..., schön ...«, sagte er, »Sie lassen Ihnen nur von einem
geistlichen Herrn vögeln ...«
Er mußte von den Hausleuten alles erfahren haben. Aber ich war ihm
gewachsen.
»Wenn Sie nicht Ruh geben ...«, sagte ich streng, »nachher zeig' ich
Ihnen bei der Polizei an ...«
Er wurde noch gelber und schwieg. Während er sich vollends anzog, hieb
und stieß er wütend mit seinen Sachen herum. Dann setzte er zornig
seinen Hut auf, kam dicht an mich heran und flüsterte: »Na warten
S' ..., mit der Polizei drohen Sie mir ..., Sie Mensch, Sie
ausgeficktes ..., warten S' ..., Sie werden mich noch einmal bitten, daß
ich Ihnen die Ehr erweis' ...« Ich lachte höhnisch auf, und er ging
fort.
Aber er war es, der zuletzt lachte.
Es war ein paar Wochen später. Ich wusch mich und stand im Hemd und
Unterrock. Der Vater, der weg ging, nahm Abschied von mir und steckte
seine Hand in mein Hemd, um ein bißchen mit meiner Brust zu spielen.
In diesem Augenblick öffnete der Rudolf -- so hieß der Kaffeehauskellner
-- rasch die Tür. Noch nie war er so zeitlich wach gewesen. Mein Vater
zog blitzschnell die Hand von mir zurück.
Rudolf sagte gelassen: »Entschuldigen, könnt' ich heut das Frühstück
früher haben? Ich muß zum Magistrat ...«
Wir glaubten, er habe nichts bemerkt.
Als aber der Vater fort war und ich in die Küche ging, um Kaffee für
Rudolf zu kochen, grinste mich der Bursche an und lachte: »Also der
Vater darf mit die Duteln spielen, was?«
»Sie lügen ja ...«, antwortete ich, rot im Gesicht.
»Ich hab' aber gut gesehen ...«, beharrte er.
»Nichts haben Sie g'sehen ...«, schrie ich, »der Vater hat mir nur
gesagt, ich soll mich besser waschen.«
Er lachte laut, trat an das Wasserschaff, zog ruhig vor mir seinen
Schweif heraus, und wusch sich ihn ab. Während ich ins Zimmer lief, rief
er mir nach: »Ich muß mich auch besser waschen ...«
Dann kam er herein und sagte: »Jawohl, ich muß mich besser waschen, denn
heut oder morgen wird mich die Fräul'n Pepi bitten, daß ich sie
petschieren soll ...«
Diesmal war ich es, die schwieg.
Wochen verstrichen. Er schaute mich nicht an, ich schaute ihn nicht an.
Der Vater und ich vergnügten uns, wenn auch nicht gerade jede Nacht, so
doch oft, und wir hatten alle Künste, die mir schon vorher so geläufig
waren, durchgemacht.
Daß ich mit meinem Vater so lebte, machte den Eindruck auf mich, daß ich
mich von den anderen, besonders aber von den Buben fern hielt. Nur
zweimal war ich in der Zwischenzeit beim Herrn Kooperator gewesen, und
nur, um wieder von ihm absolviert zu werden.
Das erste Mal fand ich ein kleines Mädchen von sieben Jahren bei ihm. Er
hatte sie nackt ausgezogen, und sie lachte mir vom Bett her schon
entgegen. Der Kooperator schleckte sie, was ihr sehr gut gefiel. Sie
hatte, wie sie mir dann erzählte, sonst mit ihrem Onkel und dann mit dem
Fleischhauer in unserer Gasse Unzucht getrieben, ohne zu vögeln. Der
Kooperator vögelte sie also auch nicht. Aus Vorsicht, wie ich glaube,
sondern er »reinigte« sie nur, und ich kam ihm eben recht, seinen
erregten kleinen Laienbruder in meiner Einzelzelle zu besänftigen. Ich
mußte mit aufs Bett und während der Kooperator purifizierte, entsündigte
er mich mit kolossalen Stößen. Dann entließ er uns beide und blieb
schnaufend zurück.
Das zweite Mal war ich allein mit ihm, und konnte ihm von meinem Vater
beichten.
Er schlug die Hände zusammen: »Da bist du verloren ...«
Ich glaubte ihm jetzt nicht mehr, sondern spielte einfach die Komödie
mit, und meinte nur, er solle die Absolution teurer verkaufen.
»Ich werde fleißig Buße tun, Hochwürden«, versprach ich.
»Wie denn Buße ...?« rief er.
Da kniete ich nieder, holte seinen Weihwedel heraus und fing an ihn so
zu lecken, daß er ihm wie ein Dampfkessel zu brodeln begann.
Ich stieß mir seinen Zapfen bis an mein Zapferl in den Rachen.
Er langte hinunter und rief mich: »Komm.«
Da drehte ich mich um, ließ ihm den Popo und zwischen meinen Beinen nach
rückwärts greifend, schob ich mir seinen Kolben hinein, wetzte so
eifrig, daß es im Augenblick danach kein Halten mehr gab, und seine
Wasser sprangen.
Ich ließ ihn aber nicht zur Ruhe kommen, sondern züngelte ihn wieder
auf, und wiederholte die Buße ein zweites Mal, und wir schieden zuletzt
versöhnt. Nur mußte ich geloben, mich von meinem Vater fernzuhalten. Ich
tat es ruhig, weil ich wußte, ich könne mir auch für meine
Rückfälligkeit Verzeihung erlangen.
Mein Vater hatte, nachdem die erste stürmische Zeit vorüber war, die
Gewohnheit angenommen, mich regelmäßig am Sonntag früh vor dem Aufstehen
zu vögeln. Das ist, wie ich heute weiß, bei allen Arbeitern der Fall,
die während der Woche müde sind, zeitlich auf müssen und deshalb
meistens am Sonntag, wenn sie ausgeschlafen sind, ihre Frauen besteigen.
So war es jetzt auch bei uns Brauch geworden, und während der Woche
bekam ich den gewünschten Strudel nur hie und da einmal auch in der
Nacht, und auch da nur dann, wenn ich mir ihn selbst holte.
Des Morgens aber war der Vater doch immer am meisten aufgelegt, mich
abzutätscheln, und ehe er das Haus verließ, noch ein wenig mit mir zu
spielen. Dazu reizte ihn wohl der Umstand, daß ich, während er sich
anzog und wusch und frühstückte, meist im Hemd herumging oder doch nur
im Unterrock und Hemd.
Eines Morgens nun, es war, glaube ich an einem Donnerstag, und wir
hatten seit dem Sonntagmorgen nichts mit einander gehabt, griff mir der
Vater jedesmal an die Brüste, so daß ich ganz aufgeregt wurde. Ich hielt
sie ihm also auch noch extra hin, und er wurde immer geiler. Endlich,
als er sich gewaschen hatte, und ich gerade das Bettzeug lüften wollte,
erwischte er mich, wie ich an ihm vorbei mußte, fuhr mir ins Hemd und
traktierte meine Himbeeren, die sich aufstellten. Ich hätte es in diesem
Moment gar zu gern getan, und wie er so in den Unterhosen vor mir stand,
griff ich zu und faßte seinen stehenden Fechter beim Kopf. So rieben wir
uns beide ein paar Sekunden dort, wo es uns am wohlsten tat, bis mein
Vater mich unbedachter Weise aufs Bett warf, und ich ebenfalls
unbedachter Weise mir eine schnelle Frühstücksnummer erhoffte. Er hatte
mir eben die Röcke aufgehoben und sich auf mich geworfen, als Rudolf die
Türe öffnete.
»O Pardon!« sagte er und fuhr zurück.
Wir stoben entsetzt auseinander. Der Vater ging sofort hinaus, und ich
hörte ihn nach einer Weile sagen: »Das Mädel muß man mit Gewalt aus dem
Bett ziehen, sie will sonst nicht aufstehen ...«
Rudolf lachte.
Als der Vater hereinkam, sagte er beschwichtigend zu mir: »Er hat gar
nix gesehen.«
Ich erwiderte nichts, aber ich war nur zu sehr vom Gegenteil überzeugt.
Der Vater hatte denn auch kaum das Haus verlassen, als Rudolf
hereinstürzte.
»Na«, fuhr er mich an, »hat der Vater vielleicht heut auch nur haben
wollen, daß du dich besser waschen sollst ...?«
Da ich noch im Hemd war, hielt ich mir ein Handtuch vor die Brust. Er
riß es mir weg.
»Mach keine G'schichten ...«, lachte er, und ich bemerkte erst jetzt,
daß er mich duzte.
»Hab' ich mit Ihnen Bruderschaft getrunken?« fuhr ich ihn an.
»Geniern werd' ich mich vor so einem ausgefickten Luder, die mit dem
eigenen Vater vögelt.«
»Wir haben nicht gevögelt ...«, widersprach ich der Wahrheit gemäß.
»Halt's Maul«, schrie er mich an, »willst mir vielleicht abstreiten, was
ich selbst gesehen hab' ...«
»Nix haben S' g'sehen ...«
»So? Ist er vielleicht nicht auf dir gelegen, wie ich hereingekommen
bin, und hast nicht den Kittel in der Höh' gehabt ...?«
»Nein«, sagte ich, aber schon sehr unsicher.
»Soo ...? Nein!« Er kam näher. »Dann werd' ich dir sagen was ich gesehen
hab: Ich hab' vorhin von draußen gesehen, wie er dir alleweil ins Hemd
hineingegriffen hat, na? Und weißt, was ich noch gesehen hab'?«
Ich schaute ihn angstvoll an.
»Ich hab' gesehen«, fuhr er in scharfem Ton fort, »wie du ihm den
Schwanz aus der Hose gezogen hast ..., und dann hat er dich aufs Bett
hergeschmissen ...«
Ich war zerschmettert.
»Na ...«, lachte er, und faßte mich unterm Kinn, so daß ich die Augen zu
ihm erheben mußte, »ist das vielleicht nicht wahr ...?«
Ich senkte den Blick vor ihm und schwieg.
»So«, sagte er entschieden, »und weil die Fräulein Pepi so frech und
keck zu mir gewesen ist, geh' ich jetzt stante pede auf die Polizei und
zeig' die ganze G'schicht an.«
Darauf war ich nicht gefaßt gewesen. Eine entsetzliche Angst ergriff
mich.
Er weidete sich daran und quälte mich noch mehr: »Alle zwei werdet ihr
eingesperrt ... du und dein Herr Papa ...«
»Nein!« stieß ich hervor.
»Nein?« wiederholte er. »Nein? Na, das werden wir ja gleich sehen ...,
ich kann ja beeiden, was ich gesehen hab'.«
Damit wollte er zur Tür: »Gleich geh' ich ...«
Ich warf mich zwischen ihn und die Tür.
»Bitte ...«, stammelte ich.
»Da gibt's nichts zu bitten mehr ...« Er wollte die Türschnalle
ergreifen.
Ich hielt fest die Arme vor die Tür gebreitet: »Bitte ...«
»Bitte ..., was?« wiederholte er höhnisch.
Ich flüsterte: »Bitte ..., verzeihen Sie mir Herr Rudolf ..., daß ich
keck zu Ihnen war ...«
»Aha ...«, frohlockte er, »jetzt auf einmal ..., was?«
Ich wurde dringender: »Gehn S' nicht auf die Polizei, Herr Rudolf ...,
bitte.«
»Ah ja«, drohte er ..., »ich geh' schon auf die Polizei, das gibt's
nicht ...«
Ich brach in Tränen aus: »Bitte, gehn S' nicht, Herr Rudolf ..., ich
kann nichts dafür ...«
»Für was kannst du nix ...?«
»Dafür ..., daß mich der Vater ...«
»So?« sagte er und neigte sich dicht zu mir: »Und dafür kennst du mich
nicht, daß du mich so weggestoßen hast, wie ich dich hab' ein bisserl
da angreifen wollen ...?« Er berührte leicht meine Brust.
»Ich werd's nimmer tun ...«, weinte ich.
»Alsdann jetzt laßt du mich mit die Duterln spielen ..., was?«
»Ja ..., Herr Rudolf ...«
Er riß mir das Hemd ab und nahm meine Brüste in die Hand und spielte mit
den Zeigefingern an den Warzen.
»Das darf ich jetzt machen ..., was?« spottete er.
»Ja ..., ja«, sagte ich und ließ es geschehen.
Er rieb sich stehend mit dem Hosenlatz an meiner Fut: »Und das da ...«,
meinte er lauernd, »das dürfte ich jetzt auch ..., was?«
»Ja, Herr Rudolf.« Ich war willenlos.
»So ...?« grinste er, »jetzt möchst du dich von mir vögeln lassen ...?«
Mir war es die einzige Rettung: »Ja, Herr Rudolf.«
»Und ich mag dich gar nicht vögeln«, rief er lachend, »ich mag nur auf
die Polizei gehen ...«
Ich weinte laut. Da fuhr er fort: »Außer du tust mich schön bitten, ich
soll dich pudern ..., ha?«
»Ich bitt' schön, Herr Rudolf.«
»Wart.« Er spielte schneller mit meiner Brust.
»Ich bitte ...«, wiederholte ich.
»Sag's doch ...«, rief er und stieß unten gegen mich.
»Ich bitte ..., Herr Rudolf ..., pudern Sie mich ...«, sagte ich
gehorsam.
»Also komm.« Er ließ von mir ab und ging zum Bett.
Ich folgte ihm ohne Willen.
»Leg dich nieder«, befahl er.
Ich tat es.
»Heb deine Kleider auf!«
Ich gehorchte.
Er betrachtete mich, wie ich dalag.
Dann kommandierte er weiter: »Mach mir das Hosentürl auf.«
Auch das tat ich. Sein Schwanz sprang heraus. Es war eine dünne weiße
Nudel, die schief in die Höhe stand.
Jetzt stieg er ins Bett, legte sich auf mich und sagte: »So, und
hineinstecken mußt du dir ihn auch selber.«
Ich ergriff seinen Schwanz und führte ihn mir hinein. Von der
Annehmlichkeit, die ich unwillkürlich empfand, und von der Angst vor der
Polizei endlich befreit, atmete ich auf. Rudolf stak beinahe bis zum
Heft in der Scheide, aber er lag ruhig. »Jetzt mußt du noch sagen, bitte
Herr Rudolf, stoßen Sie ...«
»Bitte Herr Rudolf, stoßen Sie ...«, das sagte ich gern.
Meine Brust war nackt. Er ergriff sie und spielte damit und stieß unten
seinen Wurm hin und her. Ich verabscheute ihn, ich haßte ihn, aber ich
konnte mir nicht helfen, ich wurde geil. Denn er vögelte, indem er den
Keil bei jedem Stoß ganz herauszog, um ihn dann sacht wieder ganz hinein
zu bohren.
Nach dem zehnten oder zwölften Dolchstoß ließ ich meinen Popo springen
und begriff nicht mehr, warum ich mich gegen dieses Abenteuer so
gesträubt hatte.
»Ah ..., ah ...«, rief er, »jetzt werd' ich die Peperl öfter vögeln,
was?«
Und ich: »Fester ..., schneller ..., mir kommt's ..., ach ..., ja ...,
öfter vögeln?«
»So ist's recht ...«, meinte er, »so werden wir uns vertragen ...«
»Ach«, zischelte ich, »... mir kommt's ..., spritzen Sie, Herr Rudolf.«
»Langsam ...«, erwiderte er, »... ich habe Zeit.«
Er blieb immer im selben Tempo.
Plötzlich fragte er, ohne sich zu unterbrechen: »Vögelst du oft mit dem
Vater ...?«
Ich leugnete: »Nie ..., heut hat er das erste Mal wollen ...«
Er bohrte mir eben wieder den Schweif hinein: »Lüg nicht«, zischte er
dabei.
»Ach ..., mir kommt's schon wieder ...«, rief ich.
»Sag die Wahrheit«, befahl er mir.
»Ja ..., ja ...«, antwortete ich.
»Alsdann vögelst du oft mit dem Vater ...?«
»Ja ..., oft ... mir kommt's ..., fester ...«
»Wann denn immer ...?«
»Meistens in der Nacht ...«
»Seit wann?«
»Schon ein halbes Jahr ...«
»Alle Nacht?«
»Nein ...«
»Fickt er gut ...?«
»Ja ...«
»Besser wie ich ...?«
»Nein ..., nein ...«, versicherte ich schmeichelnd, »... mir kommt's
schon wieder.«
»Nimmst du ihn auch in den Mund?« inquirierte er weiter.
»Ja ...«
»Auch den meinigen ...?«
»Ja ...«, versprach ich.
»Und schleckt er dir die Fut aus ...?«
»Ja ...«
»Ist das gut ...?«
»Ja ...«
»Soll ich's auch tun ...«
»Ja ...«
Vielleicht eine halbe Stunde lang bearbeitete er mich, und ich schwamm
in meinem eigenen Saft und in Seligkeit. Endlich keuchte er: »Ich
spritz'! Ich spritz'! Jetzt! Jetzt!«
Und damit gab er mir eine solche Ladung, daß es hörbar zu gurgeln
anfing, so rann mir das Fruchtwasser aus dem Leib.
Wie wir fertig waren, spielte er noch ein bißchen mit meinen Brüsten und
plauschte mit mir.
»Ich hab' es gleich gewußt, daß ich dich vögeln werde ...«
»Warum?« fragte ich ihn.
»Weil ich gleich gewußt hab', was los ist, wie ich die G'schicht vom
Katecheten gehört hab', und wie ich gesehen hab', daß du neben dein'
Vater schlafst ...«
»Ich kann nix dafür«, verteidigte ich mich, »der Vater hat's g'sagt ...«
»Das glaub' ich«, lachte er.
»Werden Sie's niemandem sagen?« wollte ich wissen.
»Woher denn. Wenn du dich von mir immer vögeln laßt ...«
»Ja ..., ich lass' mich immer vögeln ...«, gelobte ich.
»Und dann ..., ich weiß es ja schon länger«, ... lächelte er.
»Was denn ...?«
»Na, das mit dem Vater ...«
»Woher denn?«
»Weil ich schon paarmal zug'schaut hab' ...«
Ich erschrak noch nachträglich. »Wann, wann haben Sie zug'schaut ...«
»Ein paarmal ..., am Sonntag in der Früh ...«
»So ...!«
»Soll ich dir's beweisen? Vorigen Sonntag bist du oben g'legen und er
unten, und dann hast du's noch in den Mund genommen, und beim zweitenmal
bist du unten gelegen ..., was?«
»Ja ...« ich erinnerte mich. Es war im ersten Dämmerlicht gewesen.
Er stand auf: »Na, alsdann bist von heut ab meine Geliebte ... Jetzt
hab' ich halt zwei ...«
Ich wurde neugierig: »Zwei ...?«
»Ja ...«
»Wer ist denn die andere ...?«
»Du wirst sie schon noch sehen ...«
Damit ging er fort.
Alle Tage des Morgens, wenn mein Vater weggegangen war, kam er herein
und fragte: »Na, war heute nacht was los ...?«
Und ich mußte ihm erzählen, ob ich gevögelt hatte oder nicht. Er wollte
auch wissen, ob ich noch mit anderen Männern verkehre. Aber das
verschwieg ich ihm wohlweislich und sagte von meinem Kooperator kein
Wort. Er gebrauchte mich keineswegs alle Tage, manchmal spielte er nur
so mit meinen Brüsten oder fingerte unten ein wenig herum, und manchmal
sagte er geradaus: »Heut is nix, ... ich hab' gestern meine andere
Geliebte gefickt ...«
Ich fand noch immer keinen Gefallen an ihm, wenn er nicht gerade drin
bei mir war, aber ich haßte ihn auch nicht mehr, sondern hielt ihn für
ausnehmend gescheit, weshalb ich eine große Achtung vor ihm empfand.
Zum Kooperator ging ich alle vierzehn Tage etwa. Aber es war jetzt nicht
mehr die Rede von Reue, von Buße oder Beichte oder vom Reinigen. Er
hatte mich eines Tages gleich als ich ins Zimmer trat, ohne weiteres
entkleidet, mich geschleckt und gevögelt, sich wieder schlecken lassen
und mich dann ein zweites Mal nummeriert und nur lauter Schweinereien
gesprochen. Seit damals verkehrte ich mit ihm wie mit den andern
Männern, und wenn er auf mir lag oder ich auf ihm, sagte ich sogar du zu
ihm.
Rudolf behandelte mich andauernd gut, mein Vater auch, und an mehr
dachte ich nicht.
Wenn mich mein Vater jetzt in der Frühe beim Ankleiden an den Brüsten
nahm oder mir seinen Schweif zum Spielen gab, legte ich mir keine Scheu
mehr auf, weil ich nun wußte, daß Rudolf nicht mehr auf der Lauer lag,
sondern schlief. Ein paarmal sagte ich sogar scherzweise zu ihm: »Heut
hätten S' uns wieder erwischen können, den Vater und mich ...«
Er erkundigte sich: »Habt's gevögelt ...?«
»Nein ..., aber ... gespielt ... hat er wieder mit mir.«
Rudolf meinte gütig: »Laß ihn nur spielen ..., ich schau nicht mehr ...«
Das sagte er mir so oft, auch von selbst, bis ich daran glaubte und ein
paarmal, wenn der Vater während dieser Morgenunterhaltungen innehaltend
meinte: »Pst ..., am End kommt der Rudolf ...«, war ich selbst es
gewesen, die ihn mit den Worten beruhigte: »Ach was ..., der
schlaft ...«
So scherzte er auch eines Morgens mit mir und hatte mir das Hemd
herabgezogen, so daß meine Brust frei war. Er küßte sie und begann das
Spiel an den Saugwarzen, was mich ja immer, bis auf den heutigen Tag,
mit sofortigem Begehren erfüllt.
Da auch er noch im Hemd war, und nicht einmal eine Unterhose anhatte,
war mir sein ganzes Wehrgehänge rasch zur Hand, und ich bearbeitete
seinen Streichriemen, bis er sich ganz straff anspannte und zu pulsieren
begann.
Da fuhr er mir unter die Röcke und drängte mich gegen das Bett. Mir fiel
doch noch der Rudolf ein, und ich wehrte mich: »Nicht ..., der könnt
doch was hören ...«
»A was, der schlaft ja«, wiederholte der Vater meine sonst ständige Rede
und fügte hinzu: »Mir kommt's sowieso gleich.«
Ich rieb seinen Schaft noch geschwinder und schlug ihm vor: »Lassen Sie
sich's so kommen.« Denn mich hinzulegen, traute ich mich doch nicht.
»Dann hast du aber nix«, meinte er gutmütig.
»Ich brauch' nix«, erwiderte ich und setzte bei mir den Vorsatz hinzu,
mich dann von Rudolf schadlos halten zu lassen.
Aber es half nichts.
»Nein, nein ..., komm nur ...«, drängte er.
Und da ich ohnehin schon halb bereit war, es zu tun, ließ ich mich aufs
Bett werfen und steckte noch, damit die Sache nur ja geschwinder ginge,
den Kolben eigenhändig in die Maschine.
»Ah ..., ah ...«, der Vater begann zu stoßen.
»Ah ..., fester ..., fester ...«, erwiderte ich ihm.
»Ach ..., grad heut ist's so gut ...«, keuchte er.
»Mir kommt's schon ... jetzt«, gestand ich.
»Noch ein paar Stöße ..., so ..., ich spritz' ... jetzt spritz' ich ...«
In diesem Augenblick schlug auch schon seine Samenwelle gegen mich an,
aber in diesem Augenblick öffnete sich die Türe, Rudolf erschien und
fragte gelassen: »Was machen S' denn da, Herr Nachbar.«
Mein Vater war so überrascht, daß er rasch drei, vier Stöße tat, um sich
möglichst vollständig zu entleeren.
»Lassen S' Ihnen nicht stören ...«, höhnte Rudolf.
Jetzt fuhr mein Vater in die Höhe und stand mit fliegendem Atem bleich
vor Rudolf.
Rudolf fixierte ihn.
Ich blieb auf dem Bett liegen wie ich war, denn ich wußte nicht, was ich
tun sollte.
»Decken wir erst das Mädel zu«, höhnte Rudolf, und zog mir die Röcke
herab. Dann sah er meine nackte Brust, warf einen Polster drauf und
sagte: »Halten S' Ihnen das vor, mich regen die Duteln auf.«
Der Vater hatte noch kein Wort herausgebracht.
Rudolf wandte sich zu ihm: »Na, Herr Nachbar ..., was haben S' denn mit
dem Mädel da getan?«
Mein Vater stammelte: »Herr Rudolf ..., Sie werden mich doch nicht
unglücklich machen wollen ...«
Rudolf lachte: »Aber warum denn? Das geht doch keinen Menschen was an,
wenn Sie Ihre Tochter petschieren. Sie haben ja das Madel gemacht ...«
»Herr Rudolf«, stotterte mein Vater, »ich bin Witwer ..., ich bin noch
nicht so alt ... Geld hab' ich keins ... Ich kann's doch nicht beim Arm
herausschwitzen ...«
»Aber ..., aber ..., ist schon recht ..., ist schon recht ...«
»Herr Rudolf«, flehte mein Vater, »Sie müssen mir einen heiligen Eid
schwören, daß Sie nix verraten ...«
»Fällt mir nicht ein«, rief Rudolf obenhin, »ich schwöre nicht ...,
fällt mir nicht ein ..., aber ziagn's Ihnen nur an, und kommen S' in die
Küche hinaus, da reden wir dann ein Wort miteinander ...«
Voll Aufregung zog sich mein Vater an. Als er in die Küche hinauskam,
war Rudolf schon weg.
Jetzt waren wir beide bestürzt. Der Vater ging in die Arbeit, ich trieb
mich umher wie sonst, und mit Beklommenheit legten wir uns abends
schlafen, ohne miteinander zu sprechen. Doch wußten wir, was uns
bedrückte.
Der Vater sagte nur einmal: »Wenn er mich anzeigt ..., der Kerl ...,
nachher erschlag' ich ihn.«
Aber ich gelobte mir für diesen Fall auch meinerseits den Herrn Rudolf
in die Tinte zu legen.
Wir schliefen ein, wachten wieder auf, schliefen wieder eine Weile. Wir
warteten beide auf Rudolf und hofften, er werde, wenn er heimkommt, mit
sich reden lassen.
Endlich hörten wir die Türe aufgehen.
»Jetzt ist er da ...«, sagte der Vater. Er nahm ohne weiters an, daß ich
wach sei, und ich war es auch. Es mochte drei Uhr sein. Draußen zog sich
Rudolf aus, und wir hörten ihn hantieren.
»Soll ich jetzt zu ihm hinausgehen?« fragte der Vater.
»Probieren Sie's«, riet ich ihm.
Ehe er aber noch aus dem Bett steigen konnte, öffnete sich die Türe. Wir
hörten es, obwohl wir nichts sahen, denn es war stockfinster.
Von der Türe her rief Rudolf leise ins Zimmer: »Schlafen S' Herr
Nachbar?«
»Nein, nein«, sagte mein Vater lebhaft, »hab' die Ehre Herr Rudolf ...«
Ohne den Gruß zu erwidern rief Rudolf im selben Ton: »Gehn S', lassen S'
die Peperl zu mir herauskommen ...«
»Was wollen S' ...?« Mein Vater setzte sich im Bett auf.
Rudolf wiederholte gleichmütig: »Lassen S' die Peperl zu mir
herauskommen«, und er fügte hinzu: »Sie haben doch nichts dagegen, Herr
Nachbar ...?« In diesem Nachsatz lag eine Drohung.
Mein Vater verstand sie wohl und sagte nichts.
Rudolf wartete in der Tür.
Endlich flüsterte mir der Vater im scheuen Ton zu: »So geh halt zu
ihm ..., da kann man nix machen ..., geh Peperl ...« Es klang bedrückt
und traurig.
Ich sprang aus dem Bett, lief zur Tür, Rudolf empfing mich, zog mich in
die Küche und schloß die Tür.
»Komm ins Bett ...«, sagte er zu mir.
Wir legten uns nieder.
»So«, er kicherte vergnügt, und schmiegte sich an mich, »jetzt bleibst
du eine halbe Stunde da, und wenn du dann wieder hineingehst, sag, ich
hab' dich gevögelt ...«
»Das trau' ich mich nicht ...«, meinte ich.
»A, was ..., er darf dir nichts tun und wird dir nichts tun«, redete er
mir zu. »Er hat dich ja selber zu mir gehen geheißen.«
Wir lagen ruhig beisammen. Ich wartete.
»Also ..., wenn er dich fragt, ob ich dich gepudert hab', sagst du ja«,
fing er wieder an. Ich fragte verwundert: »Werden Sie mich denn nicht
vögeln?«
»Nein«, lehnte er ab, »ich hab' grad vorhin meine Geliebte gevögelt,
zweimal ..., ich kann nicht mehr ...«
»Deswegen ...«, ich faßte ihn bei seinem ausgeschöpften Brunnen. »Es
wird schon gehen ...«
»Ja, willst denn du ...?« er nahm meine Brüste.
»Ich möcht' schon ...«, gab ich zurück.
»Na, ich glaube nicht, aber ich werd' probieren ...«
»Soll ich ihn in den Mund nehmen ...?« erbot ich mich.
»Wart ...«, meinte Rudolf, »ich werde dir was zeigen, wo du auch was
davon hast ...«
Ich mußte mich auf ihn legen, aber mit dem Kopf nach unten. So konnte
ich seine Nudel mit Wiederbelebungsversuchen bestürmen, indem er seine
Lippen und seine Zunge in meine Schamlippen vergrub.
Diese Doppelarbeit war mir noch neu, aber sie erschien mir äußerst
rentabel. Während ich mich um seine erschlaffte Stange ohne Erfolg
bemühte, schmeichelte er mir es ab, daß es mir alle Augenblicke kam, und
ich hielt seinen Knebel gerne im Mund, denn er hinderte mich am Schreien
und Seufzen, was ich sonst vor Wonne gewiß getan hätte, was ich aber
meines Vaters wegen gerne unterließ.
Die Situation tat das ihrige, auch Rudolf in Aufregung zu bringen, und
wie ich bemerkte, daß aus seinen Ruinen neues Leben zu blühen anfing,
drehte ich mich um und da ich schon einmal oben auf lag, fügte ich
rittlings zusammen, was zusammengehörte.
Das laute Schnaufen hielten wir alle beide zurück, Rudolf und ich. Aber
er remmelte in langen Stößen, und als er spritzte, hob er mich so hoch
in die Höhe, daß ich beinahe zum Bett hinausgefallen wäre.
»Geh jetzt wieder hinein ...«, sagte er, als alles vorüber war.
Ich fürchtete mich und erklärte Rudolf:
»Ich fürcht' mich ...«
»Lächerlich«, meinte er, »wenn er was will, soll er nur kommen. Sag ihm
nur, daß er dich selbst herausgeschickt hat ...«
Ich schlich ins Zimmer zurück. Der Vater rührte sich nicht. Wie ich aber
hin ins Bett kam, fragte er: »Na, was ist ...?«
»Nichts ...«, sagte ich leise.
»Was war denn?« fuhr er fort.
»Nichts«, erwiderte ich.
»Was hat er denn von dir wollen ...?«
»Sie wissen schon, Vater ...«, erwiderte ich.
»Hat er dich gevögelt ...?« fuhr er mich an.
»Ja ..., aber Sie haben mich ja hinausgeschickt ...«
»Gevögelt hat er dich ...?«
»Ich kann ja nichts dafür ...«, beschwichtigte ich ihn.
»Gleich gehst her ...«, herrschte er mich an.
Ich kroch gehorsam zu ihm ins Bett hinüber, unter seine Decke.
»Was schaffen S' denn, Vater ...?«
Er warf sich ungestüm auf mich und preßte mir die Beine auseinander. Ich
nahm seinen Pflock, der noch nie so hart war.
»Lassen S' gut sein ...«, sagte ich, »wir machen's deswegen doch, sooft
Sie wollen ..., und den Kerl lass ich nicht mehr drüber ...«
»Halt's Maul, du Hur!« raunte er mir zu, »du bist ja doch nur eine
Hur ...«
Und er trieb mir ohne Rücksicht den Schweif bis an den Magen in den
Leib.
»Jetzt hat sie der auch gevögelt ..., der auch ...«, keuchte er dabei.
»Hat er dir's vielleicht in den Mund gesteckt ...«
»Mir kommt's ..., Vater ..., mir kommt's ..., bei Ihnen kommt's
mir ...«, rief ich.
»Ob er dir's auch in den Mund gesteckt hat ...«
»Ja ..., überall hat er mir's hingesteckt ...«, ich sagte, was er hören
wollte, »und die Fut hat er mir ausgeschleckt ... und mir kommt's ...,
schneller ..., schneller.«
»Ist dir's bei ihm auch gekommen ...?«
»Ja ...«, ich genierte mich nicht mehr, »ja ..., ein paarmal ist's mir
gekommen.«
Und ich hatte noch nicht diese Worte ausgesprochen, da schmetterte er
mir seine Ladung gegen die Gebärmutter.
Dann schliefen wir beide erschöpft ein. Am andern Morgen war nicht mehr
die Rede davon.
Wenige Tage später war ein Feiertag. Mein Vater und Rudolf hatten nichts
mehr miteinander gesprochen. Rudolf schlief, wenn mein Vater fortging,
und mein Vater schlief, wenn Rudolf nach Hause kam.
An diesem Feiertag nun, wir hatten eben genachtmahlt, und der Vater
rauchte noch seine Pfeife, kam Rudolf plötzlich nach Hause. Es war halb
neun, also eine ungewohnte Stunde.
Er trat freundlich grüßend ins Zimmer und stellte zwei Weinflaschen auf
den Tisch.
»Grüß Ihnen Gott, Herr Nachbar ...«, rief er, »trinken wir keinen Wein
miteinander ...?«
Der Vater, der gerne trank, lächelte und sagte: »Meinetwegen ...«
Und Rudolf fuhr bezeichnungsvoll fort: »Deswegen keine Feindschaft,
was?«
»Nein«, lachte der Vater, »keine Feindschaft ..., Sie meinen wegen der
Peperl ...?«
»Herr Nachbar«, rief Rudolf, »Sie sind ein fescher Kerl. Sind wir
lustig. Von heut an bin ich vazierend, machen wir uns einen guten
Abend ..., wollen S'?«
»Gilt schon«, rief der Vater, und ich dachte, Rudolfs Vorschlag werde
darauf hinauslaufen, daß mich alle zwei vögeln wollen.
Aber Rudolf führte ganz anderes im Schild. »Gestatten schon, Herr
Nachbar, daß meine Geliebte auch dabei ist ...«, fragte er.
»Was für eine Geliebte ...?« erwiderte der Vater staunend.
»Sie steht nämlich am Gang draußen ...« erklärte Rudolf.
»Aber bitte, bitte ..., sie soll nur hereinkommen.«
Rudolf ging hinaus und kam gleich darauf mit seiner Geliebten zurück.
Sie war etwa fünfzehn Jahre vorbei, mager, mit einer aufgestülpten Nase,
frechen Augen und einem breiten Mund. Nur ihr Busen fiel mir auf. Er war
für ihre Magerkeit erstaunlich groß und stand weit auseinander, straff
und fest. Sie ging aber absichtlich so, daß er bei jedem Schritt
zitterte.
Die Unterhaltung begann. Rudolf war sehr heiter, und Zenzi, seine
Geliebte, lachte zu jedem Wort, das er sagte.
Auch mein Vater lachte immer mehr, je mehr er trank, und wir alle hatten
bald einen Schwips.
Der Wein ging schon bald zur Neige, als Rudolf die Zenzi umschlang und
ihren Busen in die Hand nahm.
»Das ist ein Brusterl, Herr Nachbar, hart wie Stein ...«, sagte er.
Zenzi lachte laut auf, und der Vater schielte auf die Brust von ihr, die
Rudolf in der Hand hielt.
»Greifen Sie es nur an«, ermunterte ihn Rudolf, »wann gefällig ist ...,
ich tu' nicht eifern, greifen S' nur zu ...«
Mein Vater rührte sich nicht. Rudolf ließ Zenzi los und kam zu mir. »Ja,
die Peperl«, sagte er, »die hat auch schöne harte Duterln ... sehr
schöne sogar ..., grad so schön wie die Zenzi ...«; er nahm ungeniert
vor dem Vater meine Brüste in die Hand. »Aber kleiner sind sie als der
Zenzi ihre und nicht so spitzig ..., mehr rund ...«
Zenzi lachte laut auf.
»Zenzi ...«, gebot Rudolf, »zeig dem Herrn da deine Duteln ...«
Gehorsam knöpfte sie ihr Leibchen auf, löste die Achselspange ihres
Hemdes, daß es herunterglitt, und die eine Brust hervorsprang. Sie
lachte und ging zu meinem Vater hin.
Es war wirklich merkwürdig, wie spitz und fest ihre Brust wegstand, und
die Warze darauf war wie ein neuer, kleiner, frisch angelegter Busen.
Ich schaute sie bewundernd an, ohne darauf zu achten, daß Rudolf mir ins
Hemd gefahren war und meine Brust in der Hand hielt.
»Na, was sagen Sie«, fragte Rudolf meinen Vater.
»Sehr schön ..., sehr schön ...« Der Vater konnte nicht widerstehen. Er
streckte die Hand aus und ließ die Brust von Zenzi auf- und
niederspringen. Sie lachte nur.
»Revanche ..., Herr Nachbar ...«, lachte Rudolf.
Der Vater nahm jetzt die Brust ganz in die Hand. Zenzi trat näher zu ihm
und lachte nur.
»Zenzi ...«, kommandierte Rudolf, »spiel mit dem Herrn ein bisserl ...«
Gehorsam knöpfte sie meinem Vater die Hose auf, und ich sah, wie
geschickt sie den Schwanz herausnahm und wie sie ihn streichelte, dann
nahm sie noch die Eier mit dazu und rieb sanft an ihnen. Dabei schaute
sie meinem Vater immerzu ins Gesicht und lachte.
»Wenn Sie die Zenzi vögeln wollen, bitte ..., mit Vergnügen ...«, rief
Rudolf, »ist nur die Revanche, Herr Nachbar ...«
Mein Vater ließ sich das Bajonett wichsen und gab keine Antwort.
»Zenzi«, befahl Rudolf, »du wirst dich von dem Herrn pudern lassen,
verstehst ...?«
Zenzi mißverstand das, hob ihre Röcke auf und wollte sich meinem Vater
aufs Knie setzen.
»Zenzi«, rief Rudolf streng, »was macht man erst ...?«
Sie kniete augenblicklich nieder, und im Nu verschwand die Nudel, die
meinem Vater zur Hose herausstand, so lang sie war, in ihrem Mund.
Rudolf stand auf: »Alsdann, ich lass sie Ihnen da ..., Herr Nachbar«,
sagte er, »und die Peperl nimm ich mit mir, wollen Sie ...?«
Mein Vater nickte nur mit dem Kopf.
Rudolf aber trat nochmals zu ihm. »Hör auf zu schlecken, Zenzi«, sagte
er. Sie hielt inne und sah ihn an.
»Passen S' auf, Herr Nachbar«, wiederholte Rudolf. »Ich lass Ihnen die
Zenzi da, und Sie vögeln die Zenzi, und ich nehm' mir die Peperl mit und
vögel die Peperl ...«
»Gehn Sie vorne«, keuchte der Vater, stand auf und warf die Zenzi brutal
aufs Bett. Sie lachte laut. Aber er warf sich über sie und mit ihrer
aalglatten Geschicklichkeit hatte sie ihn sofort auf den rechten Weg
gebracht.
Wir sahen, wie er losstieß und hörten Zenzi wispern: »Tu nur schön
vögeln ..., tu nur schön pudern ..., schön fickerln ..., jaa?«
Rudolf geriet plötzlich in Aufregung und ich auch.
»Ah was«, sagte er, »da werden wir uns auch nicht genieren.«
Damit warf er mich aufs andere Bett, legte sich drauf, und ich empfing
seine Stöße.
Es war ein schönes Quartett.
Der Vater schnaufte: »Her mit der Dutel ..., so ..., stoß noch besser
mit dem Arsch ..., so ist's gut ...«
Rudolf keuchte: »Himmelkruzitürken ..., das ist gut ..., so hab' ich's
gern ..., nur langsam, wir haben Zeit.«
Ich quietschte: »Mir kommt's ..., mir kommt's ..., Vater ...,
Rudolf ..., mir kommt's.«
Und Zenzi wisperte: »Ach ..., fickere mich ..., mach mir ein Kind ...,
fickere mich ..., ja ..., beiß mir die Dutel ab ..., beiß mir die Dutel
ab ..., Rudolf ..., der fickt mich ..., er fickt mich ...«
Nacheinander spritzten der Vater und Rudolf, und ihr Bellen, Stöhnen,
Röcheln, Schnaufen vermengte sich mit dem Quietschen, Seufzen und
Keuchen von Zenzi und mir, und mit dem Krachen der beiden Betten.
Wie sie fertig waren, rief Rudolf seine Zenzi: »Komm hinaus,
schlafen ...«
Sie wand sich unter meinem Vater hervor, und im Abgehen sagte Rudolf:
»Ja, Herr Nachbar ..., die zweite Nummer macht jeder mit der
Seinigen ...«
Mein Vater wälzte sich zu mir herbei und begann gleich das Busenspiel
wieder, und ich trachtete seinen kleinen Bruder meinen Bettzapfen wieder
in die Höhe zu bringen.
Weil das nicht gleich gehen wollte, wandte ich die neue Kunst an, die
mich Rudolf neulich gelehrt hatte. Ich gab ihm meine Pastete als
Umschlag über das Gesicht und nahm seinen Schweif als Erfrischungsbonbon
in den Mund, und wie wir dann das Resultat genossen und ich mich
umdrehen konnte, um mich meinen Vater unterzulegen, hörten wir von
draußen Zenzi: »Fick mich ..., Rudi ..., fick mich ..., du machst es am
besten von allen ..., ah Rudi ..., Rudi ..., wie viel' Schwänz' hab' ich
schon hereinlassen müssen ..., aber du machst es am besten ..., fick
noch ..., so ..., so ..., hinaus ..., herein ..., ah ..., ah ..., ich
tu', was du willst, Rudi ...«
Und Rudolf sagte: »Halt's Maul, dumme Gans ..., gib die Fut her und laß
mich vögeln ...«
»Macht sie's gut ...?« fragte ich, während der Vater die ersten Stöße
tat.
»Ja ..., sehr gut ..., so warm und so fest halten tut sie einen
damit ...«
»Besser als ich ...«, fragte ich und ließ meinen Popo tanzen.
»Nein ..., nein ..., ach ..., fester mit dem Popo ..., fester ...«
Und ich entgegnete: »Fick mich ..., fick mich ..., gut ..., so ..., du
machst es am besten ...«
Das hatte ich soeben von Zenzi gelernt.
Zenzi blieb nun einfach bei uns. Sie schlief bei Rudolf in der Küche und
ging bei Tage mit ihren spitzigen, hippenden Brüsten bei mir im Zimmer
herum. Auch sie war mir zuwider, doch ließ sie sich so viel von mir
gefallen, war immer so freundlich mit mir und fügte sich so geduldig und
gehorsam in alles, daß ich mich bald an sie gewöhnte. Sie schlief
manchmal beim Vater, und in solchen Nächten lag ich bei Rudolf. Der
Vater und Rudolf vertrugen sich ausgezeichnet und teilten sich nach
Laune in uns beiden. Rudolf zog daher nie den Kürzeren, denn da er
vazierend war, blieb er oft tagelang zu Hause, und dann nahm er uns zwei
auf einmal vor.
Einmal, als ich nach Hause kam und ins Haustor trat, fand ich Zenzi, die
gerade von Herrn Horak an der Brust abgegriffen wurde. Ich ging vorbei,
Zenzi rief mir »Servus« zu, und Horak beachtete mich kaum.
Oben saß Rudolf in der Küche.
»Hast du die Zenzi nicht g'sehen?« fragte er mich.
Ich dachte ihr was Ordentliches einzubrocken und sagte: »Ja, unten in
der Einfahrt steht sie ...«
»Mit wem ...?« fragte Rudolf lauernd.
»Mit dem Herrn Horak ...«, sagte ich.
»So ...? Was tut sie denn mit ihm ...?«
»Ich weiß nicht ...«, meinte ich gleichgültig, »ich hab' nur gesehen,
daß er sie bei den Duteln angreift ...«
»Na alsdann ...«, lachte Rudolf, »wenn's ihm eine Freude macht ...«
Zenzi blieb lange aus. Als sie endlich kam, ging Rudolf mit ihr in die
Küche. Ich erwartete ein furchtbares Strafgericht und horchte:
»Wo warst denn so lang ...?« begann er.
»Hat mich schon gevögelt ...«, sagte sie lachend.
»Wo denn ...?« fragte Rudolf erstaunt.
»Im Keller ...«, beichtete Zenzi.
»Na und ...?« forschte Rudolf.
»Zwei Gulden ..., da hast ...« Zenzi gab ihm Geld. Rudolf lachte und
ließ sich von ihr Zigaretten holen.
Dieser Vorfall setzte mich nicht weiter in Erstaunen, denn ich wußte,
daß Herr Horak manchmal etwas schenkte. Er hatte ja auch mir Geld
gegeben.
Nach ein paar Tagen aber kam Zenzi in der Dämmerstunde mit einem Herrn
nach Hause. Sie öffnete die Tür ein wenig und flüsterte Rudolf zu: »Es
ist wer da.«
»Komm ins Zimmer«, sagte Rudolf zu mir.
Wir gingen hinein, und gleich darauf hörten wir Männerschritte in der
Küche.
Rudolf horchte. Ich trat neben ihm zur Türe.
Zenzi redete mit einem Manne: »Mach dir's bequem ...«
»Ach nein ...«, antwortete er, »ich mach' nur die Hose auf ...«
Gleich darauf Zenzi: »Ja ..., das Schwanzerl ..., wie das steht ...«
Und der Mann: »Gib das Hemd weg von der Brust ...«
Zenzi: »Soll ich mich ganz ausziehn ...?«
Der Mann: »Besser wär's schon ...«
Eine Pause folgte. Dann hörte man das dumpfe Geräusch, wie wenn jemand
auf's Bett fällt.
Zenzi sagte: »Gehn S' her ...«
Sofort hörten wir sie aufseufzen: »Ah ..., fick mich ..., tu nur schön
vögerln ..., so ...«
Der Mann unterbrach sie: »Sei ruhig ..., ich kann das Reden beim Pudern
nicht leiden ...«
»Viechkerl ...«, flüsterte Rudolf.
Ich war vom Zuhören aufgeregt und machte mich an Rudolfs Hosentürl. Er
stieß mich fort: »Laß gehn ...«, zischte er, »ich hab' jetzt keine
Zeit ...«
Draußen krachte das Bett. Der Mann ächzte, Zenzi schnaufte. Endlich
hörten wir sie lachen: »Aus is ...«
Der Mann stieg aus dem Bett, und Zenzi sagte: »Da bist du ja gleich
angezogen ...«
Geldstücke klirrten. Die Tür ging leise auf. Der Mann war fort. Zenzi
kam herein. Sie war nackt und lachte und hielt Rudolf drei Gulden hin.
»Drei Gulden hab' ich gekriegt ...«
Rudolf nahm das Geld und steckte es ein. Dann sagte er: »Zieh dich an.«
Zenzi zog sich an und erzählte, was für ein feiner Mann das gewesen war,
und daß er einen kleinen dicken Schwanz gehabt hatte. Rudolf unterbrach
sie und schickte sie um Wein und Zigaretten. Kaum war sie fort, fragte
er: »Magst du jetzt vögeln ...?«
Er ließ mir keine Zeit zur Antwort, warf mich gegen die Wand und rieb
mir stehend seinen Klöppel hinein, daß mir die Suppe bis zum Knie
hinunterlief.
»So«, sagte er dann, »und heut schlafst du bei mir ...«
Als der Vater nach Hause kam, wurde der Wein getrunken. Rudolf und der
Vater waren schwer berauscht und der Vater griff Zenzi immer unter die
Röcke.
»Ich möcht' ..., ich möcht' ...«, lallte er.
»Zieh dich aus ...«, verlangte Rudolf. Sie tat es sofort.
»Du auch ...«, sagte der Vater zu mir. Ich zog mich ebenso nackt aus,
wie Zenzi.
Rudolf und der Vater saßen nebeneinander auf dem Ledersofa und riefen
uns. Wir gingen beide zu ihnen, und Rudolf wollte mich anfassen.
»Nein ...«, lallte mein Vater, »meine Tochter vögel ich selber ...,
meine Tochter braucht nicht mit fremden Leuten zu pudern, die sie gar
nichts angehen ...«
Schon wollte Rudolf heftig werden, aber Zenzi saß gleich auf seinem
Schoß und versorgte sich mit seinem Vorrat. Ich hockte mich auf den
Vater und gleichzeitig ging das Stöpseln los. Der Vater griff nach
Zenzis spitzer Brust, die ihn immer anlockte, und Rudolf nach der
meinigen.
In dieser Nacht schliefen wir alle in den beiden Betten. Zenzi und ich
konnten nicht schlafen, aber die Männer schnarchten.
Da sagte Zenzi: »Willst du vögeln?«
»Ja«, meinte ich, »aber die sind ja nicht zu erwecken.«
»Das macht nichts ...«, lachte sie, »ich kenn' das schon, wenn der
Rudolf besoffen ist, puder ich trotzdem mit ihm.«
Sie nahm seinen Schweif, der sich sofort aufrichtete.
Ich holte den väterlichen Gnadenspender hervor und wollte ihn in den
Mund nehmen.
»Aber nicht ...«, wehrte Zenzi ab, »wenn er doch schlaft und besoffen
ist, so spritzt er dir in den Mund hinein. Wenn einer nur schlaft, aber
nicht besoffen ist, so wacht er auf, wenn du ihn schleckst. Wenn er aber
einen Rausch hat, nachher spritzt er gleich.«
Beide Kerzen standen nun schön gerade vor uns. »Welchen willst du?«
fragte ich Zenzi.
Aber sie refüsierte: »Gar keinen ..., ich hab' genug gefickt schon ...,
ich mag keinen mehr ...«
»Ja, was machen wir?« meinte ich.
»Na ..., du nimmst alle zwei ...«, lachte sie.
Ich hockte mich nach ihrer Anordnung zuerst über meinen Vater, mit dem
Rücken zu seinem Gesicht, so als ob ich mein Wasser lassen wollte. Zenzi
leistete mir Beistand, und setzte mir den Zahn in jenen Mund, in dem man
ewig zahnlos bleibt.
Kaum spürte ich den Stachel, als ich auf- und niederrutschte.
»Ist's so gut ...?« fragte Zenzi.
»Ja ..., ach ..., ja ...«, gab ich zur Antwort.
»Wart, ich zeig' dir was ...«
Sie hockte vor mir, griff mit der Hand hinunter und streichelte mit dem
Finger meinen Kitzler, der in dieser Stellung unberührt geblieben wäre.
Ich tanzte heftiger und mein Vater stöhnte im Schlaf.
Zenzi nahm meine Brust in den Mund und sog leise daran. Sie machte es so
zart, so leise, daß es mir sofort kam. Sie sog weiter und es wollte mir
zum zweitenmal die Wonne losbrechen, als ich vom Vater die volle Ladung
bekam. Er spritzte einen ganzen Eimer aus, als ob ihm der getrunkene
Wein zum Schwanz herausfahren wollte. Aber es geschah mit zwei
Zuckungen, und sein Schaft wurde augenblicklich so weich, daß er mir
entwischte und kraftlos zusammenfiel.
»Komm jetzt zum Rudolf ...«, drängte Zenzi, denn ich jammerte: »O
je ..., jetzt grad wär's mir gekommen.«
Sie rutschte mir nach und übernahm auch dort die Vermittlung. Und ich
hatte kaum diese neue Steife bei mir, als ich auf und niedersprang, mich
dabei an Zenzi hielt, und ihr mein Liedchen vorsang: »Mir kommt's ...,
ach ..., mir kommt's ...«
Rudolf knirschte mit den Zähnen und keuchte, aber er erwachte nicht, so
groß war sein Rausch, und so tief sein Schlaf.
»Mir kommt's ..., Zenzi ..., mir kommt's«, ächzte ich.
Sie lächelte: »Beim Rudolf kommt's einem immer ...«, meinte sie.
Ich packte ihre glatten, spitzen Brüste, und spielte damit. Ich mußte es
plötzlich tun, ohne zu wissen warum. Aber es erhöhte meine Wollust
unbeschreiblich, und ich machte es, daß mir nichts zu kommen mehr blieb.
»Ich bin fertig ...«, seufzte ich, »laß mich herunter ...«
»Bleib ...«, befahl sie, »erst muß der Rudolf spritzen.«
Und sie zwang mich, ihm seine Stange zu reiben und aus seinem Brunnen zu
schöpfen, bis das Wasser floß. Es stieg wie eine Fontäne hoch hinauf,
und ich ließ es in mich hineinspritzen, bis kein Tropfen mehr kam. Dann
sanken wir beide, Zenzi und ich, zwischen die schlafenden Männer und
lagen beieinander.
Aber diese Nacht war noch nicht vorbei. Zenzi war jetzt doch wieder
aufgeregt und jammerte: »O je ..., o je ..., jetzt möcht' ich ...,
jetzt ..., möcht' ich ...«
»Na, so mach du's ...«, riet ich ihr.
»Aber nein ...«, sie war ganz weg, »jetzt wird er ihnen nicht mehr
stehen.«
»Probier's doch ...«, ermunterte ich sie.
Sie glitt zum Vater hin und begann ihn zu streicheln und zu reiben.
Umsonst. Sie nahm seinen Schweif in den Mund ..., der Vater spürte
nichts, auch im Schlaf nicht, und seine Lanze blieb gesenkt.
»Nichts ist ...«, klagte Zenzi; und wandte sich zu Rudolf. Auch sein
Gewehr war ausgeschossen, und der Hahn ließ sich nicht mehr spannen, wie
wohl sich Zenzi auch bemühte. Endlich nahm sie ihn in den Mund, sog
zweimal daran und begann plötzlich zu husten und zu schlucken.
»Er spritzt ...«, rief sie verzweifelt, »er spritzt ...«, und dabei
hielt sie seinen Zipfel in die Höhe, aus dem der Same matt herausquoll.
Zenzi spuckte aus und kam zu mir.
»O Gott ..., o Gott ...«, jammerte sie verzweifelt, »das Schlecken und
Spritzen hat mich noch viel geiler gemacht ...«
Ich lachte.
»Du kannst leicht lachen ...«, grollte sie, »du hast's gut gehabt ...,
ich war schön dumm ...«
Ich lachte noch mehr.
»Was fang' ich an ...«, fragte sie verzweifelnd, und wetzte ihn hin und
her. Auf einmal riß sie meine Hand an sich und führte sich sie zwischen
die Füße: »Mach mir's ...«, bat sie.
»Wie soll ich dir's denn machen ...?«
»Weißt ..., so ..., komm ..., ich will vögeln ..., komm ...«
Sie legte sich auf den Rücken: »Leg dich auf mich ...«
Ich tat wie sie wollte, und sie rieb sich zuerst ihre Fut gegen die
meine. Dann mußte ich meine Hand dazwischen geben, und sie mit dem
Finger stoßen, als hätte sie einen Schwanz.
Sie warf sich unter mir: »Ach ..., ja ..., das ist gut ..., steck den
Finger hinein ...«
Meine Brüste, die auf sie niederhingen, ergriff sie, und tätschelte sie
eifrig und mit meiner freien Hand spielte ich an ihrer Brust.
Endlich schrie sie auf: »Mir kommt's ..., mir kommt's ...«
Ich bohrte ihr den Finger hinein, so gut ich konnte, und fühlte, wie
ihre Fut zusammenschnappte. Sie ließ meine Brust los, drückte mir den
Kopf, indem sie mich umschlang fest an ihre Duteln, und ruhte nicht
eher, bis ich auch ihre kräftigen spitzen Warzen im Mund hatte. Mich
reizte dieses Spiel. Ich sog an ihren frischen Brüsten und bohrte unten
mit dem Finger, bis sie ausgetobt hatte und mit langen Atemzügen
beruhigt dalag. Dann schliefen wir ein.
Wir waren seit dieser Nacht wirklich befreundet, und es kam oft vor, daß
ich wie ein Mann über sie herfiel, ihre Brust herausnahm und daran
spielte.
Am nächsten Tag schliefen wir alle bis in den hellen Vormittag. Der
Vater ging nicht in die Arbeit, und Lorenz kam aus der Sattlerei
nachzuschauen, was es gäbe.
»Nichts«, sagte der Vater, »ich bin krank.«
Lorenz ging, ohne einen von uns eines Blickes zu würdigen.
Die Trinkgelage wiederholten sich, und es wiederholte sich, daß Zenzi
mit einem Mann nach Hause kam. Rudolf dachte nicht daran, sich wieder um
eine Stelle umzusehen.
Einmal kam Zenzi, und wir hörten an der Stimme des Mannes, daß er sehr
alt sein müsse.
Zenzi lachte: »Ja, so ein kleines Wuzerl ...«
Der alte Mann sagte: »Das macht nichts ..., das macht nichts ..., wenn
er steht, wird er schon größer werden ...«
Nach einer Weile rief Zenzi: »Aber er steht ja nicht ...«
Der alte Mann: »Es dauert nur ein bisserl länger ..., er wird schon
stehen.«
Wieder nach einer Weile sagte Zenzi leise: »Ich kann nicht mehr ..., mir
tut schon die Hand weh ...«
Der alte Mann: »Das macht nichts ..., nimm's nur in den Mund ...«
Zenzi fragte: »Was geben S' mir dann?«
Der alte Mann: »Was ich dir geb' ...? Meinetwegen ..., ich geb' dir zehn
Gulden ..., aber nimm's in den Mund ...«
Rudolf gab es einen Ruck: »Herrschaft!« murmelte er, und ich war ganz
erschrocken über das viele Geld.
Es dauerte lange, bis Zenzi endlich sagte: »So, er steht schon ...,
kommen S' her ...«
Wir hörten, wie sie ins Bett fielen. Nach einer kurzen Pause lachte
Zenzi auf: »Er steht ja schon wieder nicht ...«
Der alte Mann murmelte etwas, sie wälzten sich im Bett herum, dann brach
Zenzi los: »Ach ..., ach ..., ja ..., so ..., das ist gut ..., gut ...,
ja ..., weiter ..., schneller ...«
Rudolf meinte zu mir: »Jetzt schleckt er sie ...«
Dann rief Zenzi: »Kommen S', jetzt steht er wieder ...«
Sie wälzten sich noch einmal, und Zenzi lachte; »ist schon wieder
zusammengefallen ...«
Der alte Mann sagte ärgerlich: »Ist nicht wahr ..., steck ihn nur
hinein ...«
Das Bett krachte, und Zenzi sagte: »Sie sind ja gar nicht drin ...«
Der alte Mann: »Laß mich nur! Ich komm' schon hinein ...«
Das Bett krachte weiter, weiter. Zenzi seufzte und rief: »So ...,
endlich ..., aber jetzt ..., gut ..., gut fickerln ..., was? ... Schon
aus ...«
Wir hörten sie wieder in der Küche herumgehen und flüstern. Dann knarrte
die Eingangstür und Zenzi rief: »Küß die Hand«, und kam gleich darauf
ins Zimmer gelaufen. Sie war im Hemd und schwang einen Zehner in der
Hand. Freudig gab sie ihn Rudolf.
Natürlich fand am Abend wieder ein großes Saufgelage statt. Wir waren
alle betrunken, und ich weiß gar nicht mehr, was wir alles getrieben
hatten. Am nächsten Tag verschlief mein Vater wieder die Arbeit, und
weil das jetzt öfters vorkam, wurde er eines Tages entlassen.
Er kam schimpfend und fluchend nach Hause, aber Rudolf tröstete ihn:
»Das macht nichts ..., du find'st bald wieder eine Arbeit.« Sie waren
längst per du miteinander. Mein Vater war sehr entrüstet und konnte sich
nicht beruhigen.
»Schlaf dich ein paar Tag aus, und dann gehst dir eine andere Arbeit
suchen«, meinte Rudolf, »und dir wird es guttun, wenn du dich
ausschlafst.«
Mein Vater begann also sich auszuschlafen. Er wälzte sich die Vormittage
im Bett herum, spielte mit Rudolf Karten, und verbrachte seine Zeit
damit, abwechselnd Zenzi oder mir an den Brüsten zu spielen. Dabei
benützte er mich jetzt beinahe in jeder Nacht, und bei Tag machte er
sich auch noch über Zenzi her, denn er war immer angetrunken.
Da er seine Tage zu Hause verbrachte, war er auch einmal anwesend, als
Zenzi mit einem Herrn nach Hause kam. Nun standen wir zu dritt hinter
der Küchentür und lauschten, wie draußen das Geschäft vor sich ging.
Er war sehr erstaunt, und machte große Augen, als Zenzi dann hereinkam
und ihrem Rudolf drei Gulden überbrachte.
Wenige Tage später aber kam der Hausmeister herauf und erklärte, das
könne nicht mehr geduldet werden. Entweder wir müßten ausziehen, oder
Zenzi dürfe keine Herren mehr mitbringen. Der Hausmeister war sehr
höflich, und sprach mit Rudolf besonders sehr freundlich, und Zenzi
lachte. Ich vermute, Rudolf hat ihn vorher reichlich mit Geld gespickt
und vermute auch, daß Zenzi sich einmal von ihm hat vögeln lassen, denn
sonst hätte er überhaupt der Wirtschaft nicht so lange zugeschaut, und
wäre wohl auch bei seinem Besuch nicht so höflich und von einem solchen
Bedauern dieser Maßregel erfüllt gewesen.
Das Verbot kam vom Hausherrn direkt.
Rudolf nahm, nachdem der Hausmeister weggegangen war, Zenzi mit sich in
die Küche, und sie hatten eine lange Unterredung miteinander. Sie kamen
auch nachher nicht herein, sondern legten sich zusammen nieder, und man
hörte sie quietschen, stammeln und ein »noch« bitten, lauter Geräusche,
die auch auf uns ihre Wirkung übten, so daß wir, wenn auch einmal ohne
Wein, noch in den Kleidern anfingen, unser Spiel zu beginnen.
Zenzi blieb jetzt vom Hause fort, und kam immer erst am Abend, manchmal
sehr spät in der Nacht, manchmal gar erst am nächsten Morgen nach Hause.
War Rudolf abends oder morgens bei uns im Zimmer, wenn sie kam, dann gab
sie ihm vor uns ihren Verdienst, und der Vater interessierte sich für
nichts so lebhaft, als für den Betrag, den sie mitgebracht hatte.
Weil nun Zenzi oft Tage und Nächte fernblieb, und wenn sie zu Hause war,
meist schlief, hatte ich jetzt meinen Vater und Rudolf zu befriedigen,
und ich mußte in der Nacht manchmal von einem zum andern gehen, wenn
nicht Rudolf direkt zu uns hereinkam und sich als dritter ins Bett
legte.
Der Vater hatte Rudolf oft um Geld angegangen, und immer solches von ihm
bekommen, denn der Vater verdiente nichts und steckte natürlich schon
nach ein paar Wochen in allerlei Schwierigkeiten.
Einmal aber antwortete Rudolf auf ein solches Verlangen: »Warum verdient
denn die Peperl nichts ...?«
»Die Peperl ...«, fragte der Vater und sah mich an.
»Na ja«, meinte Rudolf, »die könnt' doch auch so viel verdienen, wie die
Zenzi ...«
»Soll sie eine Hur werden ...«, antwortete der Vater langsam.
»Ah was ..., eine Hur ...«, rief Rudolf, »jetzt tut's doch dasselbe was
die Zenzi macht ..., da ist nix dabei ..., und tausende Mädchen müssen
sich so ihr Geld verdienen ...«
»Das ist schon richtig ...«, mein Vater blickte unschlüssig drein,
»aber ...«
»Aber hin, aber her ...«, Rudolf hatte seinen strengen Ton, »glauben
Sie, wenn Sie das Mädel pudern, der eigene Vater, das ist vielleicht
besser ...? Na also ... Die Zenzi«, fuhr er fort, »die Zenzi verkehrt
nur mit lauter feine Herren ..., die laßt gar keinen ordinären Menschen
drüber. Was glauben S' denn? Die hab' ich schon dressiert ..., und die
Herren, von denen sich die Zenzi pudern läßt, die sind alleweil noch
nobler als der Katechet, der die Peperl gefickt hat und nicht einmal was
gezahlt hat er ihr. Der Schmutzian.«
»Der Schmutzian ...«, sagte mein Vater in nachträglicher Entrüstung.
»Na, und was möcht's denn der Pepi schaden, wenn sie jetzt für ihren
Vater was verdienen tät?« fragte Rudolf. »Sie haben sich lang genug für
Ihre Kinder geplagt ...«
»Ja, da haben S' ganz recht ...« pflichtete mein Vater bei.
»Na also ..., lassen S' die Pepi nur mit der Zenzi gehn, und die bringt
Ihnen alle Tag mindestens drei Gulden nach Haus ..., da garantier' ich
schon dafür ..., so ein schönes Mädel wie sie.«
Ich war sehr geschmeichelt, aber mein Vater fragte ängstlich: »Und die
Polizei?«
»A was, die Polizei ...«, machte Rudolf verächtlich, »hab' ich
vielleicht schon einmal wegen der Zenzi einen Anstand gehabt? Lassen Sie
nur die Zenzi machen, die kennt sich aus ...«
»Wenn aber doch einmal ...«, mein Vater hatte Angst.
»Na, und wenn schon ...«, lachte Rudolf, »nachher sagen Sie, Sie wissen
von nix ..., und das Mädel ist von selber so schlecht ... Die Pepi wird
Sie nicht verraten.«
Somit wußte ich also, daß ich mich vor der Polizei in Acht zu nehmen
hatte. Ich schwieg die ganze Zeit und wurde auch nicht gefragt. Mein
Vater überlegte hin und her, dann wiederholte er: »Nein, ich mag nicht,
daß das Mädel eine Hur wird ...«
»Aber davon ist doch keine Red«, unterbrach ihn Rudolf, »das ist ja nur
bis Sie wieder eine Arbeit gefunden haben ..., dann kann ja die Pepi
auch wieder solid werden ...«
Diese Logik leuchtete meinem Vater ein, und Rudolf gewann ihn ganz, als
er hinzufügte: »Ich lass' die Zenzi ja auch nur wieder vögeln, weil ich
vazierend bin. Bis ich eine Stelle hab', muß sie wieder brav sein.«
Am nächsten Tag rückte ich mit Zenzi aus. Es war beschlossen worden, und
so begann ich meine Laufbahn. Wir gingen in die innere Stadt, auf den
Graben, Stephansplatz, Kärntnerstraße usw. Es war Sommer, heiß und wir
hatten nur leichte Blusen an. Dazu hatte mich Zenzi zu Hause gelehrt,
mir das Hemd bis zum Gürtel herabzulassen, so daß ich die Brust unter
dem Kleid bloß hatte.
Zenzi war sehr geschickt und lachte auf dem Wege allen Männern ins
Gesicht. Ich brachte das nicht gleich zuwege, denn ich war befangen,
aber ich schaute ihnen dafür ernst in die Augen und das genügte. In der
Schönlaterngasse war ein finsteres altes Haus mit einem engen finsteren
Flur. Dorthin führte mich Zenzi. Wenn man ins Tor ging, kam man zu einer
Tür. Sie klopfte, und ein häßliches, altes Weib öffnete. Wir standen in
einer Küche, in der man fast gar nichts sah, und von der aus man in ein
Kabinett kam, das ebenso lichtlos war.
»Meine Freundin wird auch herkommen«, sagte Zenzi.
Die Alte schaute mich prüfend an und fragte: »Sind S' schon vierzehn
Jahr vorbei ...?« -- »Schon längst«, log Zenzi für mich, »sie ist nur
noch ein bisserl klein ...«
»Sie wissen ja ...«, sagte die Alte zu mir, »für jedesmal zahln S' mir
einen Gulden ..., aber Sie dürfen mir nie um acht Uhr am Abend
herkommen ...«
Wir gingen wieder. Zenzi gab mir Ratschläge, vor allem den, auf die
Polizeimänner aufzupassen, und von den Herren das Geld zu verlangen,
bevor man sie noch zuließ.
Wie wir wieder auf den Graben kamen, stieß mich Zenzi an: »Da schau ...,
der geht uns nach ...«
Vor uns ging ein großer, sehr nobel gekleideter Mann mit einem schwarzen
Bart. Er drehte sich nach uns um und sah mich an. Dann verlangsamte er
seine Schritte und ließ uns vorgehen.
An der Ecke der Dorotheerstraße zog mich Zenzi in die enge Seitengasse.
»Komm nur«, flüsterte sie, »wir biegen ein ...«
Zenzi drehte sich um. Der Herr stand an der Ecke und blickte uns nach.
Wir standen und Zenzi winkte ihm mit dem Kopf. Da kam er auf uns zu:
»Komm weiter ...«, mahnte sie, »da heraußen spricht er nicht mit
uns ...«
Sie zog mich rasch hinter ein Haustor, dort warteten wir. »Da gehst
immer her«, riet mir Zenzi, »wenn du am Graben oder in der
Kärntnerstraße bist ..., da wohnt niemand ...«
Inzwischen kam der Herr herein. Zenzi empfing ihn lächelnd, aber er trat
zu mir.
»Na, was ist denn ...?« sagte er.
»Nichts ...«, antwortete ich ihm.
Zenzi fragte »Wollen S' mitgehen ..., in der Nähe ist eine Frau ..., da
kriegen wir ein Zimmer.«
»Nein«, flüsterte er, »ich hab' keine Zeit.«
»Wir könnten auch da auf die Stiegen gehn ..., es wohnt niemand da ...«
»Willst du ...?« fragte er mich. Ich betrachtete ihn mit großer
Bewunderung, denn er sah sehr fein aus, feiner als ich je einen Mann in
der Nähe gesehen hatte. Er trug einen schönen Spazierstock mit einem
silbernen Griff und eine goldene, feine Uhrkette, die ihm um den Hals
geschlungen war.
Wir gingen die Treppe hinauf, die sehr breit und nur halb dunkel war,
und blieben auf einem Absatz stehen. »Ich werd' aufpassen ...«, sagte
Zenzi, und stellte sich in einiger Entfernung von uns auf. Der feine
Herr griff mir an die Brüste und lächelte: »Mach auf ein wenig.«
Er fuhr mit der Hand in den Spalt, den ich auftat, und war sehr
erfreut, meine Brust nackt zu finden. Ich bemerkte mit ehrerbietigem
Vergnügen, daß seine Hand ganz weich und zart war, so zart, wie meine
eigene Haut.
»Alsdann komm«, sagte er und sein Atem begann zu fliegen. Er knöpfte
sich das Hosentürl auf, und ich bekam einen Schweif in die Hand, der so
weiß und zart und dabei so kräftig und aufrecht war, wie eine
Wachskerze. Auch der Kopf daran war spitz und zart.
Ich lehnte mich an die Wand und hob die Röcke auf, weil ich dachte, er
werde mich stehend vögeln. Aber er lehnte meine Bereitschaft ab: »Laß
nur«, meinte er, »das trau' ich mich da nicht ..., spiel lieber ..., und
laß mich spielen.« So fing ich an, ihm einen abzuwichsen, während er in
meiner Bluse herumfuhr, und bald die eine, bald die andere Himbeere zum
Aufblühen brachte.
Dabei flüsterte er mir zu: »So ist's gut ..., mehr oben ...,
schneller ..., jetzt ..., wart ...« Er reichte mir ein Taschentuch. Ich
nahm es und hielt es über seine Eichel. Da zitterte er mit den Beinen,
sein Speer begann in meiner Hand zu zucken, und das Gewitter entlud
sich. Ich wischte mir die Hand auch an seinem Tuch ab, weil sie
gleichfalls angeregnet worden war. Als ich ihm das Tuch zurückgab,
steckte er mir zwei Gulden zu. Dann ging er rasch die Treppen hinunter,
ohne sich nach uns umzusehen.
Ich blieb mit Zenzi noch eine Weile auf der Treppe, dann schlichen auch
wir zum Haus hinaus. Und ich war ganz glücklich. Zwei Gulden, in zwei
Minuten verdient. Und so leicht. Was hatte ich denn für Mühe gehabt?
Dabei war ich diesem eleganten Herrn so zugetan, bewunderte ihn so sehr,
und hatte so viel Hochachtung vor ihm, daß ich gewiß kein Geld von ihm
verlangt hätte.
Auf dem Stefansplatz sprach mich ein alter Mann an. Ich erschrak zuerst,
aber Zenzi stieß mich in die Seite und so antwortete ich, als er mich
fragte: »Kann ich zu dir gehn?« mit einem »Ja«.
Er befahl mir: »Geh voraus ..., ich komme nach.«
Zenzi war im Nu von meiner Seite verschwunden, und ich schlug den Weg in
die Schönlaterngasse ein. Die Frau öffnete uns, und wir waren in dem
Kabinett allein. »Zieh dich aus ...«, sagte der alte Mann. Während ich
meine Kleider ablegte, konnte ich sein Gesicht betrachten. Er hatte ein
glattrasiertes Gesicht, einen zahnlosen Mund und spärliche weiße Haare.
Dabei war er ganz mager, seine Hände zitterten und er schien mir
überhaupt sehr gebrochen.
Er saß auf dem Ledersofa und sah mir zu. Als ich nackt war, winkte er
mich heran. Ich mußte vor ihm stehen, und er schaute mich an, ohne sich
zu rühren. Deshalb glaubte ich, es sei an mir den Anfang zu machen, und
wollte ihm die Hose öffnen. Doch er schlug mich schnell auf die Finger,
daß ich erschrak. »Warte ...«, sagte er mit einer dünnen Stimme, »warte,
bis ich dir's sagen werde ..., und steh ruhig ...«
So stand ich also still vor ihm und er streichelte mich. Endlich nahm er
seinen Spazierstock und spielte damit an meiner Brust herum. Es war ein
spanisches Rohr mit einer Elfenbeinkugel. Ganz kühl und glatt strich er
mir diese über die Haut. Schließlich setzte er sie mir unten an, und
bohrte damit meine festgeschlossenen Beine auseinander.
»Komm jetzt her ...«, befahl er mir, und streckte sich auf dem Sofa aus.
Ich wollte mich zu ihm legen, aber er stieß mich wieder mit einer
Hastigkeit zurück, die mich erschreckte: »Drunten bleiben«, knurrte er.
Ich mußte stehend seine Hose öffnen, und nahm einen greisen,
ungestrafften Gnadenspender heraus, der soviel Falten hatte, als das
Jahr Stunden besitzt, und der so klein geworden war, daß er einem
ausgespitzten Bleistiftendchen ähnelte. Dieses Läppchen Haut begann ich
zwischen den Fingern zu wuzeln, und glaubte, es werde nimmermehr eine
feste Gestalt annehmen. Ich erinnerte mich dabei an den Greis, der
unlängst bei Zenzi gewesen war und ihr soviel Mühe bereitet hatte, aber
das Nudelchen wurde in meinen Fingern fleischiger und fester, und seine
Falten glätteten sich, wie ein zerdrücktes Tüchlein unterm Bügeleisen
sich glättet.
»Minett machen ...«, kommandierte er in einer zornigen Weise.
Ich verstand den Ausdruck nicht, und wichste fleißiger.
»Minett machen ...«, wiederholte er heftiger.
Und da ich noch immer nicht gehorchte, kreischte er mich an: »Zum
Teufel, hinein! ...! Verstehst du nicht ..., Minett machen ...«
»Entschuldigen Sie, gnädiger Herr ...«, sagte ich schüchtern, »ich weiß
nicht, was das ist, ein Minett ...«
Er fand das nicht einmal lustig, sondern meinte knurrend: »In den Mund
nehmen sollst du's ..., blödes Ding.«
Ich tat, wie mir geboten war, und tat so fleißig, wie nur je, denn ich
hatte Angst vor dem alten Mann. Wie erstaunt aber war ich, als sein
Bogen sich kraftvoll spannte, kaum daß ich ihn nur ein wenig gezüngelt
hatte. Er stieg und stieg immer höher. Mein Mund konnte ihn schon nicht
mehr fassen, und als ich auf sein grobes »aufhören« den Kopf zurückbog
und ausließ, schnellte ihm ein bombenfester Schweif gegen den Bauch.
»Vögeln«, schnarrte er, »schnell ..., vögeln ..., nicht so langsam ...,
solltest schon draufsein.« Er blieb auf dem Rücken liegen, und machte es
mir so, dank meiner zahlreichen Vorstudien nicht schwer, zu verstehen,
was er wollte.
Ich kroch also auf ihn hinauf und hatte Mühe, die Einquartierung, die er
mir bot, nur halbwegs unterzubringen.
Ich wollte mich über ihn beugen, um mich festzuhalten und um ihm meine
Brüste näher zu bringen. Er aber stieß mich zurück, und brummte:
»Aufrecht sitzen!«
So mußte ich aufrecht bleiben, und mich an der Sofalehne halten, wenn
ich nicht seinen Klotz tiefer im Leib haben wollte, als mir lieb war.
Er begann mich mit seinen Stößen zu heben. Rasch und kräftig stieß er zu
und redete fortwährend dabei.
»So ..., der werd' ich's zeigen ..., Gott sei Dank ..., ich kann noch
Mädeln stemmen ..., so ...« Er flog höher und höher. »Die braucht sich
nicht von andern ficken lassen ..., so ..., weil sie vielleicht einen
alten Mann hat ..., und wenn sie es tut ..., mach ich's auch ...,
so ..., so ...«
Er redete noch allerlei Ähnliches, bis er unter mir zusammenschnappte
und sich nicht rühren konnte. Ich mußte ihm ein Glas Wein holen, und
lief, wie mir es die alte Frau angab, in den Ausschank vom heutigen
Köllnerhof. Als ich zurückkam, lag er wie tot da und rührte sich nicht.
Mein Schrecken war groß. Ich rief die Alte, die ihn mit Wasser
besprengte und mich beruhigte. Sie kannte ihn.
»Das geht bei ihm immer so ..., er kommt aber rasch wieder zu sich ...«,
meinte sie. Richtig fuhr er auf, blickte wild umher, und als er das
Glas Wein bekam, leerte er es auf einen Zug.
Sofort war er wieder auf den Beinen, schaute mich böse an und gab mir
fünf Gulden. Ich fühlte mich reich und hüpfte vor Freude in der Stube
umher. Nun sah ich ein, was ich an meiner Muschel besaß, und ich
beschloß, sie nicht mehr zu verschenken.
Eben als ich wieder auf die Straße wollte, kam Zenzi mit einem langen
jungen Mann; und wie wir uns in der Küche trafen, flüsterte sie mir
eilig zu: »Wart noch ein bissel ..., geh nicht fort ...«
Die Türe schloß sich hinter den beiden, und nach einer Weile hörte ich
Zenzi fragen: »Soll ich meine Freundin rufen?«
Der Mann antwortete mit einer dünnen, zitternden Stimme: »Ja, ich bitte
Sie recht sehr, tun Sie das ...«
Zenzi lief aus dem Zimmer und holte mich: »Komm herein«, sagte sie, »der
nimmt uns alle zwei, und der zahlt viel ... Mit dem gibt's eine Hetz,
wirst sehen ..., du mußt aber alles tun, was ich dir sag' ...«
Als wir hereintraten, erhob sich der junge Mann vom Sofa. Er war sehr
blaß und hager, hatte einen tiefschwarzen Vollbart, der ihn noch
bleicher erscheinen ließ und schwarze, traurige Augen.
Er verbeugte sich vor mir bis zur Erde, als Zenzi mich vorstellte: »Das
ist meine Freundin Josefine ...«
Ich staunte über den ernsten Ton, mit dem sie das sagte: aber wie
wunderte ich mich erst, als der junge Mann meine Hand ergriff und sie
küßte. Vor Verlegenheit lachte ich, und glaubte, er wolle einen Scherz
mit mir treiben. Doch Zenzi stieß mich an, und zischte mich an:
»Nicht lachen ..., ernst bleiben ...«
Der junge Mann erhob sich vom Handkuß, und sagte leise, als ob er sich
vor mir fürchten würde: »So jung, mein gnädiges Fräulein, und so
streng ...«
Zenzi schrie ihn an: »Das Maul halten ...«
Er erschrak und stammelte: »Entschuldigen Sie ...«
»Die Pappen halt ...«, wiederholte Zenzi wütend. »Red bis du gefragt
wirst ...«
Ich erkannte sie nicht wieder. Ihr ewig lächelndes Gesicht war ganz
verändert.
»Zieh dich aus!« herrschte sie ihn an.
»Aber nein«, unterbrach er sie mild, doch ohne den übertrieben demütigen
Ton von früher, sondern ganz sachlich. »Aber nein, das kommt ja noch
nicht ...«
»Was denn ...?« Zenzi sah ihn verlegen an.
»Erst kommt doch das mit den Fragen ...«, flüsterte er eindringlich.
»Richtig!« Sie schlug sich vor die Stirne.
Sie ging von ihm fort, machte kehrt, und trat mit verfinsterten Mienen
wieder auf ihn zu: »Du Lump!« schrie sie ihn an, »du Hund, du räudiger,
du hast gewiß wieder an mich gedacht ..., was?«
Er stammelte: »Gnädigste Komtesse ..., ich hab' müssen denken ...«
»Kusch«, unterbrach sie ihn, »gesteh, was hast du gedacht ...«
Er stammelte heiser: »Gnädigste Komtesse lesen ja in meinem Herzen ...,
Sie werden ja selbst wissen.«
»Du Schwein, du miserables ...«, donnerte ihn Zenzi an, »Du hast an
meine Fut gedacht ..., an meine Brust ..., du Hurenkerl ...,
gesteh ...«
»Ich gestehe ...«, sagte er tonlos.
»Und du hast gedacht ..., du Mistkerl ...«, fuhr sie in demselben Ton
fort ..., »daß du auf mir liegen willst ..., was? Du Lausbub ..., und
daß ich die Füße auseinander geb', und daß du mir den Schwanz
hineinsteckst ..., du Schuft du ..., du hast gedacht, daß du mich
puderst ..., du Saukerl ..., und daß du mit meinen Duteln spielst ...,
willst du gestehen, ... du elender Fallott ...?«
Er faltete bittend die Hände: »Ja, gnädigste Komtesse ..., ich
gestehe ..., ich gestehe alles ...«
»Und schämst du dich nicht vor der Prinzessin da?« Zenzi zeigte mit
ausgestreckter Hand auf mich. Ich war von allem, was ich hörte und sah
so stuff, daß es mir gar nicht auffiel, als Zenzi mich eine Prinzessin
nannte.
»Ja, ich schäme mich ...«, rief er leise und hob auch zu mir seine
Hände.
»Knie nieder ...«, befahl Zenzi.
Er warf sich sofort auf die Knie: »Ich bitte, verzeihen Sie mir,
gnädigste Komtesse«, ... flehte er inbrünstig, und zu mir gewendet bat
er: »Auch Sie, erhabene Prinzessin, bitte ich um Verzeihung ...«
»Nein ...«, fauchte Zenzi, »keine Verzeihung ..., erst die Strafe ...«
Er wurde von einer leichten Röte überflogen. »Ja ...«, stotterte er
schnell, »erst die Strafe ...«
»Zieh dich aus!« rief Zenzi.
Er legte sofort alle Kleider ab, und stand nackt vor uns. Sein Körper
war außerordentlich weiß und zart. Bebend stand er da, mit gesenktem
Haupt, und schaute Zenzi an, wie ein gepeitschter Hund.
Er stellte sich gehorsam zwischen Sofa und Kasten.
Zenzi begann sich zu entkleiden und auf einen Wink von ihr tat ich
dasselbe.
»Na wart ..., du Gauner ...«, redete sie dabei, »du wirst uns sehen ...,
alles ..., aber kriegen tust du nichts ..., mich und die Prinzessin mußt
du anschauen ..., aber nicht rühren ...«
Sie trat nackt auf ihn zu, mit ihren hochaufgerichteten Brüsten, mit
zurückgeworfenem Kopf, ihre Augen funkelten, ihre Lippen zitterten. Sie
war selbst aufgeregt.
Sie rieb ihm ihre Brüste an den Leib, rieb ihren Schoß gegen den
seinigen. Dann mußte ich dazu treten und dasselbe tun. Er schaute uns
traurig an, ließ die Arme hängen, und rührte sich nicht. Mich durchfuhr
es wie ein elektrischer Funke, als ich meine Brüste gegen seine Brust
wetzte. Sein Leib war brennend heiß wie Feuer und fühlte sich zart an,
wie Samt. Und als ich meinen Venusberg gegen seine Haare rieb, bemerkte
ich, daß seine Lanze trübselig herunterhing.
Was für Geschichten, dachte ich bei mir, wann wird das aufhören, damit
er endlich dazu kommt uns zu vögeln? Denn auch in mir hatte sich die
Geilheit schon geregt.
Zenzi zog mich von ihm fort. »Jetzt kommt die Strafe ..., du
Schwein ...«, drohte sie.
Er verfolgte sie mit gierigen Blicken. Sie ging zum Kasten und holte
zwei Ruten herunter.
»Kennst du das, du verdammter Satan ...?« fragte sie, die Ruten
schwingend.
»Ja, ich kenne das, gnädigste Komtesse ...«, rief er schluckend.
»Weißt du, was jetzt geschieht ..., du Hurenbankert ...?«
»Jetzt kommt die Strafe, gnädigste Komtesse ...«, entgegnete er
schweratmend. »Strafen Sie mich, Komtesse ..., ich verdiene es ..., und
auch Sie, erhabene Prinzessin ...«, wandte er sich zu mir, »strafen auch
Sie mich ...« Zenzi gab mir eine Rute: »Hau fest zu«, flüsterte sie
rasch. »Fest ...«
»Heraus aus dem Winkel ..., du Dieb ...«, fuhr sie ihn an.
Er näherte sich ihr.
Klatsch! Im Nu hatte sie ihm mit der Rute eins quer über die Brust
versetzt, daß ein dicker Streifen, wie ein rotes Band sichtbar wurde. Er
zuckte zusammen, und ich sah, wie sein Schweif mit einem Ruck sich
aufrichtete.
»Spürst du das, du Gauner, du Räuber, du Futschlecker ..., du
Laustanz ..., du Beutel ..., du Dreckfink ..., du Vagabund ..., spürst
du das ...?« Zenzi schlug drauf los und mit jedem Hieb kam ein neuer
Schimpfname, mit jedem Hieb wurden Brust und Bauch röter.
»Ja ..., ich spür' es ..., gnädigste Komtesse ...«, röchelte er, »ich
danke ... für die Strafe ..., ich danke ..., fester ..., bitte ...,
züchtigen Sie mich fester ... Aber die Prinzessin auch ..., warum
züchtigt mich die Prinzessin nicht ...?«
»Hau zu!« schrie mich Zenzi an, und hob gegen mich die Rute. Ich
erschrak und gab ihm einen sanften Streich über den Rücken. Seine Haut
zuckte, aber er wimmerte: »Ach, ich bitte, die erhabene Prinzessin ...,
sie will mich nicht strafen ..., ich spür' gar nichts ..., ich bitte
Prinzessin ..., ich weiß ..., ich bin unwürdig ..., aber ich bitte um
meine Strafe ..., fester ...«
Ich schlug stärker zu, und bemerkte, daß es mir Vergnügen machte.
»Danke ..., danke ..., danke ...«, stammelte er.
»Maul halten ...«, kommandierte Zenzi, »oder ich hau dir das Beuschel
aus dem Leib.«
Wir schlugen jetzt im Takt. Zenzi vorn auf seine Brust und auf seine
Schenkel, ich von hinten auf seinen Rücken und auf seinen Arsch, der
bald rot angelaufen war, und je mehr wir schlugen, desto aufgeregter
wurden wir, desto mehr Freude machte es uns, und desto besser zielten
wir.
Er stand zitternd da und redete: »Verzeihung ..., Verzeihung ..., ich
will nicht mehr an ihre schönen Duteln ..., denken ..., nein ...,
ach ..., ach ..., Verzeihung Prinzessin ..., Ihre Brüste sind so schön
und hart ..., aber ich will's nicht mehr tun ..., o ..., welche
Qualen ..., welche Schmerzen ..., ich will nicht mehr an Ihre Fut
denken ..., Komtesse ..., ich hab' davon geträumt ..., daß ich Ihnen das
Jungfernhäutel zerrissen hab' ..., gnädigste Komtesse ..., aber ich
weiß ..., man darf das nicht ..., und Sie Prinzessin ..., ich hab' mir
vorgestellt ..., daß ich Sie gevögelt hab' ..., aber ich weiß ..., das
darf nicht sein ..., Verzeihung ...«
»Niederknien«, gebot ihm Zenzi.
Er warf sich auf die Knie. »Da lieg' ich ..., im Staube vor Ihnen ...,
Angebetete ..., zertreten Sie mich ..., ich sterbe ..., in Demut ...«
»Du darfst mir die Füße küssen. Hundskerl ...«, knurrte Zenzi. Ich hörte
zu schlagen auf. Er beugte sich herab und bedeckte ihre Füße mit
glühenden Küssen. Dabei schmitzte ihn Zenzi auf seinen jetzt empor
stehenden Popo, daß es nur so pfiff.
Er stöhnte und gurgelte: »Ach Komtesse ..., zu Ihren Füßen ..., Ihr
Hund ..., Ihr Sklave ...«
»Küß die Fut ..., du hast sie beleidigt ...«, herrschte ihn Zenzi an.
Er richtete sich in den Knien auf und begrub seinen Kopf in Zenzis
Schoß.
»Saukerl ..., Zuchthäusler ..., Taschendieb ..., Galgenstrick ...,
Strizzi ...«, schimpfte sie und bearbeitete dabei seine Schultern mit
ihrer Rute.
»Wird mir ..., die Prinzessin ..., auch erlauben ...«
»Erst schön bitten ...«, gebot Zenzi.
Er drehte sich zu mir, faltete kniend die Hände und flüsterte:
»Bitte ..., bitte ..., erhabene Prinzessin ...«
»Schön aufwarten ...«, verlangte Zenzi.
Er wartete auf, wie ein Hündchen, und mich wollte ein plötzliches Lachen
überkommen, aber ein Blick von Zenzi scheuchte es fort.
»Nun zu ihr ...«, befahl sie und gab ihm einen Stoß.
Er kam auf seinen Knien zu mir herangerutscht.
Wie er meine Füße mit seinen Küssen berührte, und ich seine pickenden,
heißen Lippen auf meiner Haut fühlte, fuhr es mir bis in die Muschel,
und ich drosch auf den Hintern von ihm, der in die Höhe gerichtet war,
los, als sei er von Holz. Kleine, hellrote Blutstropfen sickerten aus
seiner blauangelaufenen Haut hervor. Ich drosch weiter, von seinen
Lippen gekitzelt.
»Erhabene Prinzessin ...«, flüsterte er, »nie wieder soll die
Niedertracht, die in mir steckt ..., Sie beleidigen ..., strafen Sie
mich nur ..., o Prinzessin ..., Sie sind grausam ..., grausam ..., aber
gerecht ..., ich leide gern ..., ich hab' es verdient.«
»Die Fut ...«, schrie ihm Zenzi zu.
Er richtete sich auf, und preßte sein Gesicht in meine Schamhaare.
Seine Lippen küßten jede Stelle. Und jeder Kuß ging mir mitten durchs
Herz, denn ich hatte schon keinen anderen Gedanken, als mich hinzuwerfen
und ordentlich behandelt zu werden. Wie er den Kopf senkte und auch
meine Muschel erreichte, trat ich ein wenig mit den Füßen auseinander,
damit er besser hinein könne. Aber er küßte nur mit den Lippen. Mit der
Zunge tat er gar nichts. Und diese heißen Küsse machten mich noch viel
geiler, als wenn er mich geschleckt hätte. Ich hörte zu schlagen auf,
weil ich mit mir selbst beschäftigt war.
Augenblicklich ließ er von mir ab. Zenzi näherte sich ihm: »Auf!« gebot
sie. Er stand auf.
»Machen Sie ein Ende ..., gnädigste Komtesse ..., machen Sie meiner Qual
ein Ende ..., Sie Grausame ...«, flehte er sie an.
»Gut«, sagte sie eifrig, »ich will es tun. Wer soll vorn sein? Die
Prinzessin oder ich ...?«
»Bitte ..., die Prinzessin ...«, bat er, »wenn sie mir die Gnade
erweisen will, die Prinzessin.«
»Also schau her«, unterwies mich Zenzi, »du nimmst seinen Beutel so ...«
Sie stellte sich vor ihm auf und nahm seinen Hodensack in die Hand, »und
dann drückst du ihn fest ..., aber nicht auf die Eier, sondern da ...«
Sie zeigte mir die Stelle, hinter den Eiern, wo der ganze Sack sich
fassen und zuschließen läßt. »Und mit der andern Hand haust du ihn auf
die Füß', auf die Schenkel, wo du halt hinkommst.« Ich befolgte ihren
Rat. Er stand aufrecht da, die Hände über der Brust gefaltet und ich
nahm seinen Beutel fest in die Linke, und schnürte ihn ab, daß mir die
Finger weh taten. Sein Schwanz stieg noch steifer in die Höhe und
schwankte hin und her, wie ein Rohr im Winde.
Mit der andern Hand schlug ich zu, und von rückwärts bearbeitete ihn
Zenzi wie rasend. Hageldicht fielen ihre Streiche und sein Hinterer
bebte jedesmal nach vorn, daß es zu fühlen war, und seinem Schweif
jedesmal einen Rucker gab.
Der junge Mann schluchzte und schrie, und stammelte dazwischen, und auf
einmal schleuderte er seinen Samen aus. Es kam so unvermutet, daß mir
der weiße Saft direkt ins Gesicht flog.
»O Prinzessin«, rief er dabei, »o gnädigste Komtesse ...«
Zenzi trischakte auf seinen Hintern los, als sie sah, daß er vorne
spritzte. Wie aber der letzte Tropfen aus ihm herausgeklopft war, warf
sie die Rute weg und ging zum Sofa, um sich hinzusetzen. Ich blieb auf
dem Boden hocken, wie ich war, trocknete mir das Gesicht ab, und
schaute, was er nun beginnen werde.
Noch immer glaubte ich, dieser sonderbare Mensch werde Zenzi oder mich
vögeln. Er stand eine Weile ganz in sich versunken da, dann raffte er
sich auf, und kleidete sich an. Hastig, ohne uns anzusehen, scheu, mit
einem ermüdeten traurigen Gesicht. Wie er fertig war, ging er in den
äußersten Winkel des Zimmers, wo ein wackliger Stuhl stand, dort machte
er sich irgendwas zu schaffen, dann rannte er förmlich hinaus, ohne uns
eines Blickes zu würdigen.
Kaum hatte er die Türe hinter sich geschlossen, als Zenzi aufsprang und
mit einem Satz in den Winkel sprang. Dort lagen auf dem Stuhl zwei
Zehner. Sie raffte sie zusammen, hielt in jeder Hand einen hoch, tanzte
im Zimmer damit herum und gab mir zuletzt den einen.
»Was ...? Das ist fein?« meinte sie, und ich, ganz perplex, war
vollkommen ihrer Meinung.
Denselben Nachmittag noch ging mir ein Mann in einem Samtanzug nach. Er
sah aus wie ein Italiener, hatte schwarze Augen, und wie es damals
besonders bei Italienern und Franzosen üblich war, einen schwarzen
Ziegenbart. Ich bog in die Seitenstraße ein, denn es war am Graben und
erst zwei Uhr Mittag. In dem schon erwähnten Haustor wartete ich auf
ihn. Er kam herein und nahm mich im finstern Torwinkel sogleich bei der
Brust, die er aber mehr so abgriff, als untersuche er mich, als um zu
spielen.
»Na, was ist?« fragte er.
Das fragten so ziemlich alle. Und ich sagte darauf: »Soll ich
vorausgehen? Es ist nicht weit.«
»Wo?« fragte er.
»In der Schönlaterngasse ...«
»Nein ...«, meinte er, »ich will gar nicht zu dir kommen ...«
»Gut«, sagte ich lächelnd, denn auch darauf war ich vorbereitet,
»bleiben wir da ...«
»Da?« Er war erstaunt.
»O ja«, beruhigte ich ihn, »auf der Stiege ... da wohnt niemand ..., da
können wir alles tun ...«
Er wollte auch das nicht. »Komm zu mir«, ... verlangte er.
»Ist es weit?« Ich zeigte Mißtrauen. »O nein ..., aber wir fahren mit
dem Komfortabel hin ...«
»Was krieg' ich denn?« wollte ich wissen.
»Sei nur ruhig ...«, entgegnete er großartig, »du wirst reichlich
bezahlt werden ...« Und weil ich zögerte, fügte er hinzu: »So gut, wie
noch nie ..., ich zahl' besser als jeder andere ...«
Er imponierte mir und flößte mir Vertrauen ein: »Gut«, sagte ich, »aber
Sie müssen mir das Geld voraus geben ...«
»Zu Haus ...«, drängte er, »zu Haus kriegst du das Geld, wenn wir zur
Tür hineinkommen.«
Wir verließen das Tor gemeinsam, und er rief, als wir durch ein paar
Gassen gegangen waren, einen Komfortabel herbei. Wir stiegen ein und als
wir losfuhren, fragte er: »Du glaubst gewiß, ich will dich vögeln?«
Ich lächelte ihn kokett an: »Was denn sonst?«
»Ich will ganz was anderes ...«, sagte er geheimnisvoll.
Ich mußte wieder lächeln; und wollte klug sein: »Aha ..., ich weiß
schon«, sagte ich.
»Na was denn?« neckte er.
»Vielleicht in den Mund ...?« riet ich.
»Nein ...«, er lachte. »Was glaubst?«
»Von hinten ...?« riet ich weiter.
Er schüttelte den Kopf.
Ich dachte, er werde sich so behandeln lassen wie der junge Mann, den
wir mit Ruten gestrichen hatten.
»Wollen Sie sich schlagen lassen?« riet ich wieder.
»Herrgott, du kennst dich aber aus«, meinte er, »nein, auch das
nicht ...«
»Ja, dann weiß ich nicht ...«, ich gab es auf.
»Photographieren will ich dich ...«, sagte er.
»Photo ...?«
»Ja, nackt photographieren, in allen möglichen Stellungen.«
Ich lachte. Ich war noch nie photographiert worden und glaubte, ich
bekäme dann schöne Bilder von mir.
Wir kamen zu ihm. In einem neuen Vorstadthaus, tief in einem alten
Garten versteckt, wohnte er. Vorne stand das Zinshaus, dann kam man
durch den Hof, dann durch den alten Garten zu dem kleinen Haus, in dem
er ein paar Zimmer und ein Atelier hatte.
Eine kleine dicke Frau empfing uns. Sie war blond, hatte eine gedrungene
Gestalt, die in einem roten Schlafrock noch fetter aussah. Ihre Augen
schienen mir unterkohlt zu sein. Sie sah mich grüßend an und meinte:
»Die wird gerad recht sein ...«
Der Photograph sagte: »Tummeln wir uns, damit wir das Licht benützen.«
Sie sagte: »Soll ich den Albert holen?«
Er: »Aber natürlich, wir können ja absolut nichts anfangen ohne ihn.«
Sie wollte fort, aber er hielt sie auf:
»Warte, ich hol' ihn selbst. Tut's euch lieber derweil herrichten.«
Damit entfernte er sich durch den Garten. Die Frau sah ihm nach und
meinte: »Jetzt fürchtet er sich schon wieder, ich könnt' mit dem Albert
allein sein.«
Dann führte sie mich ins Haus, direkt in das Atelier, das mir mit seinem
Glasplafond und seinen hohen Fenstern sehr gut gefiel. Sie öffnete eine
Tapetentür, nachdem sie einen Schrank, der sie verborgen hielt,
weggeschoben hatte. Wir traten in eine Kammer, in der nur ein kleines,
hoch angebrachtes Fenster Licht einließ.
»Ziehn Sie sich aus ...«, sagte sie zu mir.
Zu meinem Erstaunen aber begann auch sie ihren Schlafrock abzustreifen.
»Sie müssen alles ausziehen«, meinte sie, »nur die Strümpfe und die
Schuhe können Sie anbehalten.«
Sie stand im Hemd vor mir und wartete, bis ich ganz bloß war. Dann kam
sie dicht zu mir heran und musterte mich.
»Wie alt bist du denn?« Sie duzte mich auf einmal. »Vierzehn ...?«
»Noch nicht«, gab ich Bescheid.
»Hat dir mein Mann schon gesagt, was er mit dir machen will ...?«
»Ja ...«
»Na also ...«, meinte sie und streifte ihr Hemd ab. »Das übrige wirst du
schon sehen.«
»Wird er Sie auch photographieren?« fragte ich erstaunt.
Sie lachte: »Natürlich ..., bis jetzt hat er überhaupt nur mich
photographiert, weil wir noch kein anderes Frauenzimmer aufgetrieben
haben. Denn erstens ist es viel zu gefährlich und zweitens waren alle zu
teuer ...«
»Was krieg' ich denn?« erkundigte ich mich.
»Sei nur ruhig ...«, vertröstete sie, »du wirst zufrieden sein.«
Ihr gutmütiger freundlicher Ton gefiel mir.
»Ich bin ja ruhig«, sagte ich lächelnd.
»Er hätt' sicher keine andere genommen«, erzählte sie redselig, »aber er
hat eine Bestellung, zu der braucht er ein junges Ding, wie du eins
bist ...«
»Sie sind ja auch noch jung ...« Ich meinte ihr dieses Kompliment machen
zu müssen.
»O ja ...«, lachte sie, »da schau ..., hier so eine große Brust, steht
sie noch fest genug, was?«
Sie nahm ihre Brüste und wog sie in den Händen. Sie waren breit und fest
und standen so stark zur Seite, daß man glauben konnte, die beiden
Himbeeren wollten zwischen den Armen durch nach rückwärts schauen, wer
wohl von hinten käme.
»Schön sind sie ...«, sagte ich anerkennend.
»Greif her ...«, lud sie mich ein.
Ich mußte ihren Busen in die Hand nehmen, er war wirklich hart und
elastisch.
»Nur der Bauch ist ein bissel dick ...«, sagte sie.
»O nein«, beruhigte ich sie.
»Und die Schenkel ...« Sie klatschte sich aufs Fleisch und lachte. »Wenn
mich der Albert sieht«, fuhr sie fort, »wird er gleich geil.«
»Das glaub' ich ...«
»Aber mein Mann ärgert sich ...«, lachte sie. »Ja was wär's denn, wenn
er ihm nicht stehen möcht' ...? Da könnt' er uns doch gar nicht
photographieren?«
Nach diesen Worten begann ich doch zu ahnen, was hier vor sich gehen
sollte. Gleich darauf kam der Mann zurück, und rief uns heraus. Wir
traten in das Atelier und da war noch ein Bursch von etwa achtzehn
Jahren. Er mochte Laufbursche, Stallpage, oder so etwas dergleichen
sein. Denn er hatte ein sonnverbranntes und verfrorenes Gesicht mit
kleinen dicken Ohren und einer roten, ziemlich dicken Nase. Er war
schlank, aber kräftig und im ganzen nicht schlecht gekleidet. Mir
wenigstens gefiel er ganz gut.
Der Herr Capuzzi, so hieß der Photograph, schickte den Burschen, in dem
ich den herbeigerufenen Albert erkannte, sogleich in das Ankleidezimmer.
»Tummel dich«, rief er ihm nach, dann begann er mich zu mustern.
»Ist gar nicht schlecht ...«, meinte er zu seiner Frau, »he?«
»Ja«, antwortete sie ihm ernst, »es ist gerade das was du brauchst ...«
»Wie die Duterln noch ganz hoch sitzen«, meinte er.
»Sie sind noch nicht ganz heraußen ...«, erklärte die Frau.
»Und gar keine Hüften noch«, konstatierte Capuzzi.
»Auch noch so wenig Haare ...«, zeigte ihm die Frau, auf meine Muschel
deutend.
Sie waren zufrieden mit mir und Capuzzi versprach, daß ich es auch sein
solle. Er richtete seine photographischen Apparate, fuhr mit dem Kopf
unter das schwarze Tuch, und ich sah ihm gespannt zu.
Inzwischen kam Albert aus dem Zimmer, und war nackt. Er lächelte mich
an, weil ich wie gebannt auf sein Bajonett schaute, das er schon
aufgepflanzt vor sich hertrug.
Frau Capuzzi lachte hell auf und rief: »Er steht ihm richtig schon
wieder ...«
Capuzzi knurrte: »Sei ruhig ...«
Albert war sehr schön gebaut. Ich bewunderte seine gewölbte Brust, den
eingezogenen Bauch, die von Muskeln geschwellten Arme und Schenkel, und
vor allem den dicken geraden Solomuskel, der aus seinen Bauchhaaren
emporstieg.
Capuzzi sagte: »Also fangen wir an.«
Er schob eine kleine, teppichbehangene Bank ohne Lehne herbei und
meinte: »Zuerst also du, Melanie, Albert und du -- wie heißt du?« setzte
er zu mir gewendet hinzu.
»Peperl«, sagte ich.
»Also Peperl ..., Albert setz dich in die Mitte ...«
Er tat es.
»So ..., jetzt Melanie rechts zu ihm, und Pepi links zu ihm ...«
Wir beeilten uns.
»So, und jetzt nimmt jede den Schweif in die Hand ...«
Wir griffen zu.
»Albert ...«, rief Capuzzi. »Sie müssen aber auch etwas tun ... Geben
Sie die beiden Arme um die Schulter ..., still ..., einen Moment ...«
Er verschwand hinter dem schwarzen Tuch:
»So ...«, rief er hervor, »nicht bewegen. Melanie schau den Albert
an ..., du Pepi auch ..., und du Albert schau in die Höh' ..., verdreh
die Augen ...«
Wir befolgten seinen Befehl. Alberts Schweif, von unseren beiden Händen
umklammert, sah nur noch mit dem Spitzel hervor.
»Eins ..., zwei ..., drei ..., vier ..., fünf ..., sechs ...«, zählte
Capuzzi. »Fertig.«
Wir sprangen auf.
»Eine neue Stellung«, befahl er.
»Was für eine ...?« fragte die Frau.
»Leg dich nieder, Albert ...«, befahl Capuzzi.
Albert legte sich auf die schmale Bank, seine Füße hingen vom Knie an
herab.
»Melanie ..., stell dich drüber ...«
Die Frau bekam rechts und links einen Polster, auf den sie steigen
konnte.
»Beug dich über ihn ...«, rief Capuzzi.
»Das haben wir ja schon oft gehabt«, rief die Frau.
»So nicht ..., wirst schon sehen ...«, wandte er ein.
Sie beugte sich vor, stützte die Arme auf und ihre Brüste hingen gerade
über Alberts Gesicht.
»Albert, nimm die Brust in die Hand ...«, sagte Capuzzi. Albert ergriff
die beiden runden Dinger und begann an den Warzen zu spielen.
»Er regt mich schon wieder auf ...« rief Frau Capuzzi.
»Albert ...«, schrie der Photograph, »ruhig mit der Hand, sonst werd'
ich dir helfen.«
Er hielt die Brüste ruhig in seiner Hand. Aber jetzt war es Melanie, die
sich schaukelte und so ihre Duteln an Alberts Händen rieb.
»Da schauen S'«, sagte Albert, »jetzt spielen Sie ja selber ...«
»Melanie!« Der Photograph sagte es im vorwurfsvollen Tone.
»Na ja ...«, meinte sie, »wenn ich jetzt schon aufgeregt bin.«
»Peperl ...«, wandte er sich zu mir, »nimm jetzt den Schweif und steck
ihn hinein ..., laß aber die Hand nicht los.«
Ich ergriff Alberts Flaggenstange und richtete sie auf. Mit der anderen
Hand suchte ich den Eingang von Melanie. Aber sie kam mir zuvor, griff
hin, und steckte sich den Pfropfen selbst ins Spundloch.
»Ach ...«, seufzte sie dabei ..., »ach ..., die Quälerei geht schon
wieder an ...«
»Nicht so tief, Melanie«, ermahnte ihr Mann, man muß die Hand von der
Peperl sehen ...«
»Vielleicht so?« fragte sie, hob den Popo, daß der Schweif nur mehr bis
zur Eichel drin war.
»So ist's recht ...«, stimmte er bei.
»Aber nein«, rief sie, »so kommt er mir ja aus«, und wieder senkte sie
ihren Helm über dieses Haupt tief hinab.
»Nichts ...«, brüllte ihr Mann, »höher ..., zum Teufel ...« Sie zog sich
zurück und sagte: »Meinetwegen ..., aber ich glaube, so wär's auch ganz
schön ...«, und wieder stieß sie sich ihn herein.
Der Mann sprang herzu und hieb ihr eins über das Gesäß, daß es nur so
klatschte. »Du vögelst ja, du Luder ...«, schrie er sie an, »aber mich
betrügst du nicht ...«
»Das ist auch gevögelt ...«, antwortete sie gereizt, »sobald er nur drin
steckt ..., ist es gevögelt ...!«
»Nein«, ereiferte er sich, »wie oft habe ich dir das schon erklärt ...,
daß wir nur Stellungen ..., das nennt man nur markieren. Markieren ist
gestattet ..., aber nie werde ich erlauben, daß meine Frau sich von
einem anderen vögeln laßt.«
Damals leuchtete diese blödsinnige Unterscheidung mir und allen
Beteiligten ein. Heute muß ich über den wunderbaren Ehemann lächeln.
Ich hielt Alberts Nagel und fühlte, wie er pulsierte, und langsam fuhr
ich so hoch hinauf, daß ich mit der Hand auch die Muschelränder von
Melanie berührte, und da fühlte ich, wie sie ihre Klappe jede Sekunde
zusammenzog, wodurch Albert natürlich sehr gereizt werden mußte.
»Dauert's noch lang?« fragte Melanie.
»Nein ..., schau in den Apparat hinein ..., lächle ..., Pepi du
auch ..., so ..., eins ..., zwei ..., drei ..., vier ..., fünf ...,
fertig!«
Melanie sprang von Albert hinunter. »Gott sei Dank«, rief sie, »das hält
man ja nicht aus.«
Albert lag regungslos da.
»Jetzt umgekehrt ..., die Pepi hinauf ...«, befahl der Photograph.
Ich nahm die Stellung ein, die Melanie verlassen hatte.
»Melanie ..., jetzt steckst du ihn der Peperl hinein ...«, befahl der
Mann.
»Soll ich ihr die Brust anpacken ...?« fragte Albert.
»Aber ja ..., was fragst denn noch?« ermunterte der Photograph.
Albert legte seine Hände auf meine Brust. Wir lächelten uns an, und er
spielte sich damit.
Herr Capuzzi kümmerte sich gar nicht darum.
Da führte mir seine Frau den Stachel ein.
Albert und ich lächelten uns verständnisvoll an, dann fing er an zu
stoßen und ich flog auf und nieder, so daß Melanie ihre Hand fortziehen
mußte. Sie gönnte uns aber die Sache nicht, sondern rief gleich: »Da
sagst du nix ..., was? Die dürfen machen was sie wollen ...«
»Ruhig, Kinder ...«, gebot uns Capuzzi, und zählte wieder: »Eins, zwei,
drei, vier.«
Wir verhielten uns ruhig. Melanie griff wieder an Alberts Schweif, daß
es aussah, als leiste sie uns Beihilfe.
»Fertig«, meldete Capuzzi.
Jetzt legten wir wieder los und vögelten. Aber Melanie wurde böse:
»Albert ...«, schrie sie ihn an, »wirst du aufhören ...«
»Wirst du aufhören ...«, brüllte mir Capuzzi zu. Und weil das nichts
half, riß er mich von meinem guten Platz herunter.
»Das verbitt' ich mir«, sagte er, »das könnts ihr später tun ..., wenn
ihr wollt.«
Er begann eine neue Gruppe zu bauen, wie er sich ausdrückte.
Albert mußte auf seiner Bank liegenbleiben. Melanie kniete vor ihm und
nahm seinen Schwanz in den Mund.
»Nur das Spitzel ...«, sagte Capuzzi, »nur markieren ...«
Ich stellte mich über seinen Kopf und reichte meinen Freudenkelch seinen
Lippen dar. Albert schlug mit seiner Zunge einen Triller an meinem
Kitzler, der mir bewies, daß er ein Künstler war, und mich von Wonne
hin- und herwetzen ließ. Aber gleich darauf war er ruhig und markierte
nur.
Melanie machte mir Konkurrenz. Ich sah es an ihren Wangen und an dem
Zucken von Alberts Nudel, daß sie das Stückchen Mehlspeise, das ihr ihr
Mann gönnte, heimlich mit ihrer Zunge streichelte. Sie schnaufte sehr,
und blinzelte zu ihrem Mann angstvoll hinüber. Als dieser hinter das
schwarze Tuch tauchte, benützte sie die Gelegenheit, sich den Zapfen bis
auf den Grund zu bohren.
Gleich darauf hieß es wieder: »Eins ..., zwei ...«, usw., dann: »Fertig!«
Albert verabschiedete mich mit einem Zungentriller.
»Umgekehrt«, befahl Capuzzi.
Ich war es jetzt, die auf Alberts Schweif kam, und ich nahm ihn bis ans
Heft in den Mund, wobei ich ihm so wohltat, daß er erkennen mußte, ich
verstünde mich auf die Kunst der Zunge ebenso wie er.
Melanie hockte auf seinem Mund. Und ich konnte an Alberts Bewegungen
sehen, daß er nicht bloß markierte. Melanie hielt gewaltsam an sich, um
sich nicht zu bewegen. Dennoch sah ich, wie ihre Flanken bebten, wie sie
die Augen rollte, und wie sie sich fester und fester auf Albert
niederließ.
»Melanie«, rief ihr Mann, »du könntest mit deinen Duteln spielen ...,
mach so, als ob du dir die Warzen küssen wolltest.«
Sie hob ihre Brüste und senkte den Kopf und benützte die Gelegenheit, um
ein bißchen hin- und herzuwetzen. Dabei mußte ihr Kitzler aus Alberts
Mund geglitten sein, denn es gab plötzlich einen schmatzenden Laut.
Capuzzi hörte ihn, sprang hinzu und sagte wütend: »Albert, mir scheint,
du schleckst wirklich ...?«
»Aber nein ...«, gurgelte Albert unter seiner Last hervor.
»Ich rat' dir's nicht ...«, wiederholte Capuzzi, bückte sich, und
trachtete herauszubekommen, wie sich Albert verhalte.
»Aber nix macht er«, rief Melanie unwirsch.
Capuzzi sah ihr ins Gesicht: »Du bist ja ganz aufgeregt ...«, sagte er
drohend.
»Natürlich«, versetzte sie, »ich bin immer aufgeregt dabei ..., man ist
ja nicht von Holz. Tummel dich, daß wir fertig werden.«
Während Capuzzi aber zum Apparat zurückging und unter das schwarze Tuch
schlüpfte, machte Melanie ein paar schnelle Wetzer, indem sie mir dabei
zutuschelte, und Albert schlug ihr seinen Zungenwirbel in ihre
Maultrommel. Capuzzi aber war rascher fertig als sie. »Eins, zwei«,
klang es vom Apparat her und sein »Fertig« scheuchte uns auseinander.
»Was jetzt«, fragte Melanie, die mit bebenden Brüsten und keuchendem
Atem dastand.
»Leg du dich hin ...«, sagte ihr Mann.
Sie tat es sofort.
»So«, meinte er. »Jetzt soll sich die Peperl dir am Mund setzen und der
Albert soll sich auf dich legen.«
»Nein«, protestierte sie, »ich mag der ihre Fut nicht schlecken.«
»Das brauchst du auch gar nicht ...«, erwiderte er, »du sollst ja nur
markieren.«
»Ach was ..., ich mag's halt nicht beim Mund ...«, antwortete sie.
»Na, soll sich die Pepi hinlegen ...«, schlug er vor, »und du gehst auf
sie.«
Aber sie wollte die Aussicht nicht aufgeben, seinen Schweif zu kriegen.
»Weißt was«, sagte sie, »die Peperl könnt' mir ja am Busen spielen, das
sieht unschuldiger aus.«
Er war einverstanden.
Ich kniete neben ihr auf den Boden, nahm ihre Brust in beide Hände und
setzte meine Lippen auf ihre Himbeere. Was ich konnte, tat ich und ich
half ihr sogar zu einem kleinen Genuß. Von meinem Kuß angeregt, fing sie
zu zucken an, sie hupfte mit ihrem Popo in die Höhe und stieß sich so
Alberts Balken ein paarmal tief in den Leib.
Mit einem Schritt war Capuzzi bei ihr und gab ihr eine Ohrfeige. »Kannst
du das Vögeln nicht lassen? Du Luder, du ...«, schrie er sie an.
»Ich mach' ja nix ...«, kreischte sie auf.
»O ja«, sagte er wütend, »immer machst du's so ...«
»Du grober Ding du ...«, jammerte sie, »die Pepi suzelt mich an der
Brust und deshalb hab' ich so hupfen müssen ...«
»Hör zu suzeln auf ...«, befahl er mir, und zu seiner Frau gewendet
schimpfte er weiter: »Das sind Ausreden ..., immer probierst du, ob du
mit dem Albert nicht pudern kannst ..., ich weiß schon ...«
»Laß mich gehen ...«, schalt sie, »es ist kein Wunder, daß man sich
rührt, wenn einem so ein dicker Schweif angesetzt wird ...«
»Na, na ...«, meinte er, »du wirst's erwarten können ..., ich mach'
dir's dann gleich.«
Damit verschwand er hinter seinem Tuch. Eins, zwei, und er war fertig.
»So«, meinte er, »ich muß in die Dunkelkammer ..., aber das sag' ich
dir ..., wenn du dich unterstehst und machst was ..., derschlag ich
dich ...«
Er ging in einen Nebenraum.
»Jesus ...«, seufzte Melanie, »das ist mir eine Marter immer ...«
Albert meinte lächelnd: »Ich hätt' auch nichts dagegen, wenn ich mir's
schon kommen lassen könnt.«
»Mein lieber, süßer Albert ...«, flüsterte sie, »möchst du mich nicht
einmal pudern?«
»O ja ...«, antwortete er, »sehr gern möcht' ich's ..., aber es geht
nicht ...«
»O Gott, o Gott«, jammerte sie zu mir, »du glaubst gar nicht, wie gern
ich den Burschen hab' ..., du glaubst gar nicht, wie ich mir das
wünsche, daß er mich einmal, ein einzigesmal vögeln möcht' ...«
»Na, warum tun Sie's denn nicht?« fragte ich erstaunt.
»Es geht ja nicht ...«, klagte sie.
»Jetzt«, schlug ich vor, »machen Sie's g'schwind jetzt ...«
»O je ...«, sie schüttelte den Kopf, »das möcht' er ja gleich sehen ...«
»Wieso?«
Sie deutete auf die Tür, durch die Capuzzi verschwunden war.
»Durch das gelbe Glas durch, da sieht er alles ...«
Ich bemerkte jetzt erst die kleine dunkle Scheibe, die in die Tür
eingelassen war.
»Das ist es ja«, sagte sie tief bedauernd, »zwei Monate arbeiten wir
schon so ..., was Albertl ...? Seit zwei Monaten spür' ich seinen
Schweif ..., hab' ihn in der Hand und im Mund und zwischen der Brust,
und in der Fut, und im Arsch ..., und überall ..., immer nur das
Spitzel ..., immer nur den Anfang ..., man möcht' verrückt werden ...«
Albert pflichtete ihr bei: »Dös ist nicht recht ..., wenn er nicht will,
daß ich seiner Frau was mach', soll er mir's nicht herlegen ...«
»Natürlich«, stimmte ich zu, »das ist gemein ...«
»Nicht wahr ...«, meinte er. »Nackend laßt er mich's anschauen. Und bei
den Duteln laßt er mich's nehmen ..., und die Fut kenn' ich schon so,
als hätt' ich's sechzigmal gefickt ..., und nie hab' ich was machen
dürfen ..., das gibt's ja nicht ...«
»Wie hast du dir's denn kommen lassen?« erkundigte ich mich.
Er wurde rot und schwieg.
»G'wiß hast dir's selber herunterg'rissen ...?«
»Ah nein ...«, sagte er verlegen.
»Na, wie denn?« forschte ich weiter.
»Auf italienisch ...«, sagte Melanie lachend.
»Wie ist das?« fragte ich neugierig.
»Wirst es schon sehen ...«, sagte sie, »vielleicht photographiert ihn
mein Mann wieder einmal dabei ...«
Capuzzi kam heraus: »Die eine Stellung ist verpatzt«, sagte er, »die muß
noch einmal gemacht werden ...«
»Welche denn?«
»Die letzte ..., da bist du schuld ...«, knurrte er seine Frau an, »weil
du gewackelt hast ...«
Sie legte sich noch einmal hin. Albert steckte ihr nochmals seine
Schwanzspitze hinein. Ich nahm sie nochmals bei der Brust. Als er
»Fertig« rief, begann er ungeniert zu remmeln. Nur drei, vier Stöße,
aber sie waren so heftig, daß Melanie aufschrie: »Jesus, Maria ...«
Capuzzi schleuderte ihn mit einem Griff weg, daß er beinahe umgefallen
wäre. Aber Albert lachte verschmitzt. »Ich vögel' sie doch einmal ...«,
sagte er dabei.
»Nie«, schrie Capuzzi wütend.
Melanie aber kreischte: »So komm doch du wenigstens her ..., ich halt's
ja nicht aus.«
Capuzzi schäumte: »Da soll man arbeiten ..., und was
zusammenbringen ..., erst recht nicht ..., wart ...«
Melanie griff sich mit den Fingern an der Spalte herum: »Komm her ...,
komm her, oder ich ruf' den Albert ...«
»Schaut's, daß ihr hinauskommt's ...«, herrschte Capuzzi mir und Albert
zu.
Wir ließen uns das nicht zweimal sagen, und schlüpften ins
Ankleidezimmer, wo wir uns gleich auf die Erde warfen.
»Ah ...«, sagte Albert, »ich bin froh, daß du da bist ..., ich bin
froh ..., da kann ich wenigstens einmal ordentlich pudern ..., ah ...,
gib's her ..., da brauch' ich's mir nicht so kommen lassen ..., wie
sonst ..., ah ..., eine gute kleine Fotz hast du ..., so ist's gut ...,
rühr' dich nur ..., wart ..., wart ..., die Dutel ..., so ..., ich küss'
dir die Dutelwarzeln ..., fest ..., ja ...«
»Ich wart' auch schon die ganze Zeit darauf ...«, rief ich, »das macht
mich so geil ..., das probieren ..., fester ..., ah ..., gut is dein
Schweif ..., so lang ..., und so warm ..., fester, ja ... spritz ...,
spritz nur ..., ah ..., wie wohl ..., noch? Ah ..., zweimal ist mir's
gekommen.«
Wie wir fertig waren, hörten wir noch drinnen Capuzzi und Frau einander
bearbeiten. »Nein ..., nein ...«, flüsterte sie, »... noch nicht
spritzen ..., noch nicht ..., ich hab' noch nicht genug ..., noch
mehr ..., gib mir mehr ...«
Er brummte: »Was ..., du möchst aber doch lieber den Albert ..., was?«
-- »Ich scheiß' auf ihn ...«, quakte sie deutlich genug, »du bist mir
der liebste ..., fick nur ..., gib mir deinen Mund ..., deine Zunge,
ach, ach ...« Das andere war nur ein Geröchel.
Dann fragte Herr Capuzzi wieder: »Darf ich jetzt spritzen ...? Du machst
mich so hin ..., ach ..., deine Brüste ..., kann ich jetzt?«
Und sie: »Ja ..., spritz nur ..., jetzt ..., so ..., und jetzt kann der
Albert herumwetzen, wie viel er will ..., jetzt reizt er mich nicht
mehr ..., ah ..., ah ..., das ist süß ...«
»Warum reizt er dich denn?« fragte Capuzzi eifersüchtig.
Sie waren beide fertig und plauschten noch.
»Aber er reizt mich doch nicht«, beschwichtigte ihn seine Frau, »wenn er
mit seiner Nudel da ist, oder wenn ich ihn in den Mund nehm, oder wenn
er mich schleckt, dann denk' ich ja nur an dich ..., der Albert ist mir
wurscht ...«
Albert lachte: »Schmarn«, sagte er, »sie lügt ihm ja was vor ..., du
hast ja genau gehört, wie sie auf mich geil ist ..., sie hat uns es ja
selbst gesagt ...«
»Freilich«, bestätigte ich ihm. »Aber warum hast du sie nicht schon
längst einmal gepudert ..., das müßte doch möglich sein?«
»Es ist unmöglich ...«, erklärte Albert.
»Warum ...?«
»Weil der Kerl zu viel aufpaßt ...«
»Aber wenn er nicht zu Haus ist ...?« meinte ich.
»Ah was ...«, Albert schüttelte den Kopf. »Der ist schlau, man weiß ja
nie, wo er ist ..., und jeden Augenblick kann er da sein.«
»Na, und wenn schon ...«, lachte ich.
Albert wurde ernst: »Das ist nicht so ..., der derschlagt mich und
sie ..., das ist er imstand ..., der Katzelmacher, der! Der hat mehr
Kraft als ich ...«
»Aber geh«, meinte ich zweifelnd.
»Wart nur ...«, sagte Albert, »bis du den einmal nackend siehst ...«
»Wieso?«
»Na«, erklärte er mir, »manchmal laßt er sich von der Frau
photographieren.«
»So ...? Das sollt' er jetzt mit mir tun ...«, wünschte ich.
»Weißt du ...«, fragte Albert, »wie oft der seine Frau vögelt alle Tag?«
»Na, wie oft denn?«
»So sieben- bis achtmal, meine Liebe ...«
»Da könnt' sie wohl genug haben ...«, entschied ich.
»Freilich«, meinte Albert, »aber er ist ihr schon zu fad ...«
Wir wurden wieder hereingerufen.
»Eine neue Gruppe ...«, sagte Capuzzi. Er war im Hemd und in Unterhosen
und hatte ein erhitztes Gesicht. Melanie hatte rote Flecken auf der
Brust, rote Ohren, aber sie lachte befriedigt und ihre Augen glänzten.
»O je«, lachte sie, »die zwei haben's auch gemacht.« Und sie ergriff
Alberts herabhängenden Wedel, und zeigte ihn ihrem Mann.
Dann kam sie zu mir und flüsterte mir zu: »War's gut?«
»Wunderbar«, gab ich zurück, um ihr Lust zu machen, »der kann's.«
»Ja, was tun wir denn?« meinte Capuzzi, »wenn er dem Albert nicht mehr
steht ...?«
»Produzier halt du dich ...«, riet ihm Melanie, »werd' ich dich
photographieren.«
Capuzzi streifte die Kleider ab, und ich verschaute mich in eine riesige
Brust, die ganz dicht behaart war, in seine fabelhaften Arme, und in die
kolossale Rübe, die schwankend und ganz dunkelfarbig unter seinem Bauch
aufwuchs.
Er kam auf mich zu, aber Melanie rief: »Halt ..., das gibt es nicht ...,
mach die Buserantenstellungen mit dem Albert, aber laß das Mädel
gehn ...«
»Die Buseranteng'schichten haben wir schon ...«, sagte er, »da wär's
schad um die Platte.«
»Ich will nicht, daß du mit dem Mädel da ...«, keifte sie.
»Lächerlich«, meinte Capuzzi, »wenn ich dich mit dem Albert markieren
lass' ..., werd' ich doch mit der Pepi markieren dürfen ...«
»Nein«, rief Melanie eigensinnig, »du wirst geil auf sie.«
»Keine Spur ...«, verteidigte er sich, »höchstens ...«, fügte er hinzu,
»höchstens ..., mach' ich's dir noch einmal ...«
Das paßte ihr: »Aber nur markieren ...«, gebot sie.
Ich legte mich auf das Bänkchen und mußte die Füße sehr weit spreizen,
damit er dazwischen könne.
»Ah nein«, sagte Capuzzi, »das machen wir so!« Und er hob meine Beine
hoch in die Höhe, daß die Knöchelgelenke auf seinen Schultern lagen.
»Jetzt«, rief er seiner Frau zu, und schob mir seinen Riesenklöppel bis
über die Eichel hinein.
»Nicht so tief ...«, schrie Melanie, »nicht so tief.«
Ihr Verbot war überflüssig, denn was ich bei mir hatte, füllte mich
ohnehin beinahe aus. Dazu kam noch, daß Capuzzis Schweif nicht ganz
steif war, als er ihn bei mir einführte. Erst in meiner Höhle erholte er
sich von der eben absolvierten ehelichen Strapaze wieder, und ich hatte
den Genuß zu spüren, wie er größer und größer wurde. Das ersetzte mir
die Bewegungslosigkeit, die vom Markieren herkam.
»Fertig«, meldete Frau Melanie.
Er ließ mich los und arrangierte eine andere Gruppe. Das heißt, er
setzte sich in einen Stuhl, nahm mich auf seinen Schoß, aber so, daß ich
mit dem Rücken an seiner Brust lehnte, und mit dem Gesicht in den
Apparat schaute. Mit den Händen fuhr er mir unter den Achseln durch und
umpreßte meine Duteln, und seine Rübe pflanzte er in meinen Garten. Ich
wollte auf- und niederwetzen, aber er flüsterte mir zu: »Nicht
jetzt ...«
»Fertig«, rief die Frau aus dem Apparat hervor.
Eine dritte Gruppe sollte gebildet werden, aber da man dazu den Albert
gebraucht hätte, und seine Stange absolut nicht aufzurichten war, so
wurde die Sache auf ein anderesmal verschoben. Capuzzi bestellte mich
auf den übernächsten Tag, gab mir fünf Gulden und entließ mich.
Ich ging in die Stadt. Am Graben traf ich die Zenzi und ging mit ihr ihn
die Schönlaterngasse, um ihr das verdiente Geld zu zeigen und die Sache
mit dem Photographen zu erzählen. Sie hatte inzwischen niemanden gehabt.
Meine Schilderung von den verschiedenen Gruppen und Stellungen regte sie
sichtlich auf.
»Fix Laudon ...«, rief Zenzi, sich auf das Sofa werfend, »Fix
Laudon ..., von dem Reden bin ich so viel aufgeregt ..., wenn ich nur
jetzt pudern könnt' ...«
Und in diesem Punkt war ich ihrer Ansicht. Ich kroch zu ihr aufs Sofa.
Zenzi lag da und hatte glänzende Augen und ihre Brüste bebten. Sie kam
mir heute überhaupt anders vor als gewöhnlich. Lang nicht so willenlos
und so gefügig, wie zu Hause. Ich legte mich zu ihr und wir spielten uns
gegenseitig mit unseren Duteln eine Zeitlang. Ich wollte mich schon auf
sie hinaufschwingen, als sie mich mit dem Ausruf: »Äh ..., das ist ja
nix ...«, fortstieß und in die Küche hinausrief: »Sagen S' Frau
Böck ..., ist der Karl nicht da?«
Die Alte öffnete die Tür: »Ja, der Karl ist da ..., was wollen S' denn
von ihm?«
»Rufen S' ihn nur herein ...«, sagte Zenzi.
»Was wollen S' denn?« beharrte die Alte.
»Fragen S' nicht«, sagte Zenzi so befehlhaberisch, wie ich sie noch nie
gehört hatte. Ich lernte überhaupt neue Seiten an ihr kennen. »Fragen S'
nicht, sondern rufen S' ihn!«
Die Alte verschwand.
»Wer ist denn der Karl ...?« fragte ich.
»Na derer Alten ihr Enkel ist er«, erklärte mir Zenzi, indem sie aus
ihrem Kleid was herausnahm, und sich wieder auf das Sofa legte.
»Und was willst du von ihm ...?«
»Vögeln soll er ...«, sagte sie glühend.
Die Türe ging auf und ein junger Mensch von sechzehn oder siebzehn
Jahren kam herein. Er war sehr hübsch, hatte feine Züge, aber sie waren
von der Magerkeit verschärft und gespitzt, und der ganze Bursch sah
verkommen aus. Er rauchte eine Zigarette, grinste, als er uns sah, und
ich mußte an die saubere Gesellschaft denken, die immer mit der
Burgmusik läuft.
»Servus Karl ...«, sagte Zenzi, »da hast einen Gulden ..., mach mir's
einmal.« Karl kam zum Sofa herangeschlendert, nahm den Gulden, besah ihn
von allen Seiten, steckte ihn ein, und begann nachlässig mit der Brust
von Zenzi zu spielen. Dabei schaute er mich prüfend an.
»Besinn dich nicht so lang ...«, rief Zenzi.
Er knöpfte die Hose auf, und Zenzi stieß mich an: »Schau dir die Nudel
an, die der Bursch hat ..., so was gibt's nicht ...«
Karl grinste mir zu, und ich richtete mich auf, um seinen Nothelfer zu
begutachten. Aber Gott steh mir bei, so was hatte ich wirklich noch
nicht gesehen. Bis auf den Nabel und höher hinauf noch reichte dieser
Balken, und hatte eine Dicke, die ihn beängstigend machte. Der Kopf
allein war größer, als bei anderen der ganze Stempel.
»Na«, meinte Zenzi, »der ist doch einen Gulden wert ...?«
Karl warf die Zigarette weg, und legte sich auf Zenzi.
»In Gottes Namen ...«, sagte er.
Zenzi rutschte hin und her unter ihm und bat: »So komm doch ..., komm!«
»Steck dir'n selber hinein ...«, brummte er grob.
Zenzi fuhr mit den Händen hin, und brach gleich darauf in wollüstiges
Kreischen aus: »Ach ..., ach, fickerl mich ..., nicht so fest ...,
ach ..., mir kommt's ..., ach ..., mein lieber Karl ..., dich hab' ich
gern ..., bei dir möcht' ich bleiben ..., Bester ...«
»Ich pfeif' auf dich ...«, zischte er, während er seine Kanone rasch
hin- und herschob. Zenzi bäumte sich unter ihm: »Was fickst mich denn
dann?« keuchte sie. Er stieß zu und antwortete: »Weilst ein Gulden
gibst ..., wenn mir die Großmutter ein' Gulden gibt, vögel ich sie
auch ...«
Zenzi arbeitete mit ihrem ganzen Aufgebot und Karl stieß in sie hinein,
als sei er beleidigt worden. Mich regte die Sache so auf, daß ich mir es
auch zu überlegen anfing, ob ich einen Gulden zahlen solle.
Aber Karl machte dem Dilemma ein Ende, indem er sich sofort empfahl,
nachdem seine Aufgabe erledigt war.
»Bleib da ...«, bat ihn Zenzi.
»Laß mich aus ...«, sagte er grob.
»Warum willst denn nicht noch ein bissel bei mir bleiben?«
»Weil du mir zu fad bist ...«, antwortete er. »Servus ...«, und er
verschwand.
Zenzi nahm ein Glas vom Tisch und schleuderte es hinter ihm her:
»Strizzi ..., elender ...«, schrie sie. Das Glas sprang am Türfutter in
Scherben. Zenzi weinte.
Ich hatte sie nie vorher so gesehen. »Das ist der einzige ..., der
einzige ..., den ich gern hab' ..., den Lumpen den ...«, schluchzte sie,
»und ich lass' mich auch nimmer von ihm vögeln ..., was hab' ich denn
davon ...?«
Ganz erstaunt fragte ich sie: »Und der Rudolf ...?«
»Ah was, der Rudolf«, zuckte sie die Achsel.
Ich: »Du hast doch den Rudolf so gern ..., du machst doch alles was er
will ...«
Zenzi: »Mit dem Rudolf ist das was anderes ..., der könnt' mein Vater
sein ..., verliebt bin ich nicht ...«
Ich: »Ja, aber ..., du sagst doch immer zu ihm, daß es dir nur immer bei
ihm kommt ..., daß er es am besten macht ...«
Zenzi: »Was sagt man nicht alles, wenn man die Eichel drin hat ..., ich
hab' doch von dir auch gehört, was du zu deinem Vater sprichst, wenn er
auf dir liegt, und es kommt dir grad ...«
Ich: »Das ist freilich wahr.«
Zenzi: »Ich bitt' dich, mit Rudolf bin ich jetzt acht Jahr beisammen ...«
Ich: »Was? Du bist ja im ganzen erst fünfzehn Jahr alt ...«
Zenzi: »Ja ..., das macht's. Meine Mutter war die Geliebte von
Rudolf ..., und wie sie an der Auszehrung gestorben ist, war ich allein,
und der Rudolf hat mich zu sich genommen ...«
Ich: »Als Geliebte ...?«
Zenzi: »Nein ..., im Anfang hab' ich in seinem Kabinett auf dem Erdboden
geschlafen ..., und war noch froh ..., ich hab' mich vor dem Waisenhaus
gefürchtet.«
Ich: »Warum denn?«
Zenzi: »Was weiß ich ..., die Mutter hat immer geweint, wie's im Spital
war, und hat gesagt: `Wenn ich stirb', kommt das arme Kind ins
Waisenhaus ...´«
Ich: »Wo warst du denn, wie die Mutter im Spital war ...?«
Zenzi: »Beim Rudolf. Die Mutter war ja früher auch bei ihm. Sie hat ja
mit ihm gelebt ...«
Ich: »Und dein Vater ...?«
Zenzi: »An den kann ich mich gar nicht mehr erinnern ..., der ist
gestorben ..., wie ich zwei Jahre alt war.«
Ich: »Na und weiter?«
Wir saßen noch immer nackt auf dem Sofa, und streichelten uns unsere
Brüste. Zenzi hatte sich ein wenig beruhigt, und es war ihr offenbar
angenehm, sich mir völlig anzuvertrauen. Sie berichtete: »Der Rudolf hat
dann der Mutter versprochen, er nimmt sich meiner an, und ich darf bei
ihm bleiben ..., immer. Da ist dann die Mutter leichter gestorben.«
Ich: »Das glaub' ich.«
Zenzi: »Na, und so bin ich halt ein paar Monat auf der Erd gelegen, und
der Rudolf hat im Bett geschlafen.«
Ich: »Und dann ist's losgegangen, was?«
Zenzi: »Nicht sogleich. Erst hat er mich ins Bett gerufen ..., ich
brauch' nicht auf der Erden liegen, hat er gesagt.«
Ich: »Hat er dich zuerst nicht angerührt?«
Zenzi: »O ja. Wie ich mich zu ihm gelegt hab', hat er mir gleich das
Hemd aufgehoben, und hat seinen Finger in meine Spalte gelegt, und hat
mich überall gestreichelt ...«
Ich: »Was hast du dir denn dabei gedacht?«
Zenzi: »Nichts.«
Ich: »War's dir angenehm ...?«
Zenzi: »O ja ... weißt du ..., er hat so ganz leise ..., so ganz stad
gestreichelt ..., das war schon gut ...«
Ich: »Aber verstanden hast du nicht, was das ist, was?«
Zenzi: »Wieso denn nicht? Ich hab' sehr gut gewußt, was das bedeutet,
denn ich hab' ja oft in der Nacht gehört, wenn der Rudolf über der
Mutter war.«
Ich: »So? Und was hat er dann noch getan ...?«
Zenzi: »Die ersten Nächte nichts ... da hat er mich nur gestreichelt ...«
Ich: »Aber davon kommt's ihm ja doch nicht ...?«
Zenzi: »Dann hat er mir seinen Schweif in die Hand gegeben ...«
Ich: »Und du ...?«
Zenzi: »Der Rudolf hat damals gleich zu mir gesagt: `Zenzi´, hat er
gesagt, `jetzt bist du meine Geliebte. Du darfst niemandem was sagen,
und du wirst sehen, es wird dir gutgehen.´«
Ich: »War dir das recht?«
Zenzi: »O ja. Das war mir schon recht, und dann war ich auch stolz
darauf, daß ich schon so einen Geliebten hab'. Und dann hab' ich mich
gefreut, daß es mir gutgehen wird; denn ich hab' als Kind so oft nichts
zu essen gehabt.«
Ich: »Dann begreif' ich, daß dir das gepaßt hat.«
Zenzi: »Auch sonst. Ich hab' mich in der Nacht gefürchtet allein zu
liegen, wie die Mutter tot war, und wenn ich beim Rudolf im Bett war,
hab' ich keine Angst mehr gehabt. Übrigens hätt' ich auch so alles
getan, was er von mir wollen hat ...«
Ich: »Auch wenn es dir unangenehm gewesen wäre ..., warum denn?«
Zenzi: »Aber freilich. Weil ich geglaubt hab', er jagt mich auf die
Straßen, wenn ich ihm nicht folge.«
Ich: »Hat er denn damit gedroht ...?«
Zenzi: »O ja. Er hat immer gesagt, wenn ich was ausplausch', so schmeißt
er mich heraus. Dann wird mich die Polizei zusammenklauben, dann komm'
ich ins Waisenhaus, und dort werden die Kinder den ganzen Tag gehaut,
müssen auf Erbsen knien und immerfort nur beten.«
Ich: »Da ist es freilich besser, wenn man in einem warmen Bett liegt und
eine heiße Nudel in die Hand bekommt.«
Zenzi: »Oder in den Bauch ..., hahaha.«
Ich: »Na, in den Bauch wirst du sie auch nicht gleich gekriegt haben.«
Zenzi: »Nein ..., nicht gleich. Der Rudolf hat mir das ganze Werkel erst
in die Hand gegeben. `Siehst du´, hat er zu mir gesagt, `das da -- das
steckt der Mann der Frau hinein.´ Wo hinein? frug ich. `Da hinein´, sagt
er und zeigt mit dem Finger, wo bei mir der himmlische Zimmermann das
Loch gemacht hat.«
Ich: »Da hast du ja einen guten Lehrer gehabt.«
Zenzi: »O ja. Ein guter Lehrer ist der Rudolf schon gewesen. `Das sind
die Eier´, hat er mir erklärt und hat mir seinen Beutel in die Hand
gegeben. `Und da spritzt man den Samen heraus, der kommt in den Bauch
der Frau, und davon kriegt sie dann ein Kind.´«
Ich: »So genau hab' ich es im Anfang nicht gewußt. Ich bin erst viel
später drauf gekommen.«
Zenzi: »Er hat mir alles beschrieben.«
Ich: »Und weiter habt's ihr nichts gemacht?«
Zenzi: »O ja ..., alles.«
Ich: »Was denn ..., alles?«
Zenzi: »Na, wie er mir das Vögeln erklärt hat, hat er sich doch
draufgelegt und hat mich gewetzt.«
Ich: »Ist ja nicht wahr, das gibt's ja nicht.«
Zenzi: »Aber nein ..., er hat ihn ja nur auswendig angerieben. Er hat
mir ja erklärt, daß der Schwanz jetzt noch nicht hineingeht, sondern
erst später, bis ich größer bin. Aber er hat mir nur zeigen wollen, wie
man's macht.«
Ich: »Ja ..., und dabei selber spritzen.«
Zenzi: »O nein ..., er hat so nicht gespritzt, immer nur, wenn er mir's
von hinten gemacht hat ...«
Ich: »Im Popo ..., ich weiß.«
Zenzi: »Im Popo? Das geht doch nicht.«
Ich: »So? Das geht nicht? Vor drei Jahren schon hat mich der Herr von
Horak in den Popo gefickt und hat mir dort hineingespritzt, weil's von
vorn damals noch nicht gegangen ist, bei mir.«
Zenzi: »Da hör' ich einmal was Neues. Das hab' ich noch nie gemacht. Ist
denn das gut?«
Ich: »O, sehr gut ist es, es kommt einem sofort.«
Zenzi: »Ja, tut's denn nicht furchtbar weh?«
Ich: »Zuerst schon ..., aber wenn der Schwanz naß genug ist, gar nicht
mehr.«
Zenzi: »Schad -- das muß ich einmal probieren.«
Ich: »Jetzt hast du's ja gar nicht mehr notwendig, jetzt geht's ja von
vorn ...«
Zenzi: »Ja, der Rudolf hat mir damals den Schweif nur so von rückwärts
durchgesteckt ...«
Ich: »Das kenn' ich. Man gibt die Füß zusammen, und er reibt einem den
Schwanz unter den Arschbacken nach vorn ..., was?«
Zenzi: »Ja ..., genau so.«
Ich: »Und so hat er gespritzt?«
Zenzi: »Ja ..., oder auch, wenn ich ihn in den Mund genommen hab'.«
Ich: »Was? Das habt ihr auch getan?«
Zenzi: »Ja. Zuerst war's mir schwer, und ich hab' auch ein paarmal
gebrochen. Aber dann ist's schon gegangen.«
Ich: »Und hast du's geschluckt?«
Zenzi: »Manchesmal ..., ein bissel schluckt man ja überhaupt immer.«
Ich: »Und er ..., hat er nicht ...?«
Zenzi: »Aber natürlich. Stundenlang ist er mir auf der Fut gelegen und
hat sie mir ausgeschleckt und hat mir den Kitzler herausgesutzelt, denn
er hat gesagt: `Wart, das tu' ich dir, damit du auch davon was hast.´«
Ich: »Na ..., und hast du was gehabt davon?«
Zenzi: »Sei so gut ..., das nimmt einen genug her, so wohl tut das.«
Ich: »Ja ..., ich kenn' es ..., es ist süß ..., ich wollt', es wär'
jetzt jemand da, und möcht's uns machen.«
Zenzi: »Ja ..., das wollt' ich auch.«
Wir quälten uns schon die ganze Zeit an unseren Muscheln. Zenzi an der
meinigen und ich an ihrer. Jetzt konnten wir uns nicht mehr zurückhalten
und legten uns nebeneinander hin und fingerten uns, daß uns bald wieder
der Quell zu fließen begann. Dann waren wir wieder beruhigt, setzten uns
auf, und ich verlangte, Zenzi solle weitererzählen.
Sie tat es: »Schau meine Duteln an ...«, fuhr sie fort, »wie groß sie
sind ..., der Rudolf sagt, daß ich sie vom vielen Schlecken und Vögeln
so zeitig bekommen hab'. Schon mit neun Jahren hat's angefangen, und
Haare hab' ich damals schon zwischen den Füßen bekommen ...«
Ich: »Und hast du immer nur mit dem Rudolf gevögelt ...?«
Zenzi: »O nein ..., der Rudolf hat mir g'sagt, wenn mich wer angreift,
oder wohin lockt, soll ich nur aufpassen, daß mir nichts geschieht, und
daß mich niemand sieht ...«
Ich: »Was? Er hat's dir damals schon erlaubt ...?«
Zenzi: »Aber ja. Er hat gesagt, ich soll nur ihn immer gern haben,
deswegen aber kann ich mir's schon von andern Männern machen lassen. Nur
kleine Buben nicht. Wenn er das sieht, hat er g'sagt, schlagt er mich
tot.«
Ich: »Das ist aber komisch. Warum denn gerade kleine Buben nicht?«
Zenzi: »Na, wegen des Geldes ...«
Ich: »Das versteh' ich nicht ...«
Zenzi: »Also, der Rudolf hat gesagt: `Du kannst es schon hergeben, aber
du mußt immer was davon haben. Wenn dir einer auch nur die Fut angreift,
soll er dir was dafür zahlen. Umsonst ist der Tod.´«
Ich: »Und der Rest das Leben. Jö ..., da hätt' ich viel Geld verdienen
können, wenn ich gescheit gewesen wäre.«
Zenzi: »Na siehst du ..., deswegen bin ich immer beim Rudolf am
liebsten, weil er so viel gescheit ist, und man ihn um alles fragen
kann.«
Ich: »Warum hat er dann aber erlaubt, daß du dich von meinem Vater
pudern laßt?«
Zenzi: »Das ist doch sehr einfach. Wir zahlen doch seit damals keinen
Zins mehr bei euch.«
Ich: »So ..., das ist aber gemein ..., und er vögelt mich ganz
umsonst ...«
Zenzi: »Na ..., dafür verrät er doch nicht, daß du mit deinem Vater
zusammensteckst ...«
Ich: »Es ist eine Gemeinheit ..., aber ich lass' ihn nicht mehr drüber.«
Zenzi: »Mach was du willst, mir ist es ganz gleich.«
Ich: »Lassen wir das jetzt gut sein, was haben wir denn davon, was?
Erzähl lieber weiter. Hast du damals schon Geld verdient?«
Zenzi: »O ja. Zuerst war's der Kaufmann am Eck. Der hat mich immer so
angeschaut, und hat mich am Kinn gestreichelt, wenn ich drin war, was
kaufen. Und das hab' ich dem Rudolf erzählt.«
Ich: »Na und was war weiter?«
Zenzi: »Der Rudolf hat gesagt, ich soll alles mit ihm tun, was er will,
ich soll aber ein Geld von ihm verlangen.«
Ich: »Und hast du was gekriegt ...?«
Zenzi: »Das erstemal nur ein paar Sechserln.«
Ich: »Was war denn mit ihm?«
Zenzi: »Wie meinst du das?«
Ich: »Na, du weißt doch ..., ich meine, was er mit dir gemacht hat ...?«
Zenzi: »Er ist vor dem Laden gestanden, wie ich vorbeigegangen bin.«
Ich: »Na, und du ...?«
Zenzi: »Ich hab' gelacht auf ihn ...«
Ich: »Und er ...?«
Zenzi: »Er hat mich hineingerufen ...«
Ich: »Weiter ..., weiter ...«
Zenzi: »Na, und da hat er mich ins Magazin geführt.«
Ich: »Was hat er denn gesagt ...?«
Zenzi: »Er hat mir gesagt, er will mir gedörrte Zwetschgen schenken,
oder Feigen, oder so was.«
Ich: »Ja ..., und ...?«
Zenzi: »Und wie wir im Magazin waren, hat er gesagt, ich hab' so eine
Feigen, die uns nur angenehm ist ...«
Ich: »Da hat er die Fut gemeint?«
Zenzi: »Ja.«
Ich: »Und was hast du gesagt ...?«
Zenzi: »Nichts.«
Ich: »So erzähl doch, laß dich nicht immer fragen.«
Zenzi: »Ich erzähl' ja ..., er hat gesagt, ich soll ihn die Feigen
ansehen lassen, die ich zwischen den Füßen hab' ...«
Ich: »Das ist gut ..., der macht's fein ...«
Zenzi: »Wenn ich das tu' ..., hat er gesagt, schenkt er mir so viel
Feigen, wie ich will.«
Ich: »Das hast du doch getan ...?«
Zenzi: »Nein.«
Ich: »Nein ... Ich iß Feigen sehr gern.«
Zenzi: »Ich auch.«
Ich: »Na und warum dann ...?«
Zenzi: »Ich hab' an den Rudolf gedacht, und hab' gesagt: Ich brauch'
keine Feigen, ich will was anderes. `Was denn?´ fragt er. Geld, sag'
ich.«
Ich: »Hat er dir was gegeben?«
Zenzi: »Zuerst hat er mir den Rock aufgehoben und hat herumgespielt.
Dann hat er seinen Kaufmannshäring aus der Hosen genommen und ist mir
damit zwischen die Füße und am Bauch hin- und hergefahren, bis er
gespritzt hat.«
Ich: »Na, und dann?«
Zenzi: »Dann hat er mir dreißig Kreuzer geschenkt und hat gemeint, ich
soll niemanden was sagen.«
Ich: »Hast du ihm gefolgt?«
Zenzi: »Nein, ich hab' das Geld dem Rudolf gegeben.«
Ich: »Und warst du oft beim Kaufmann?«
Zenzi: »O ja ..., oft. Ich hab' alles eingekauft, um was mich Rudolf
geschickt hat, und hab' nichts gezahlt dafür ...«
Ich: »Das heißt, du bist dafür ins Magazin gegangen.«
Zenzi: »Ja.«
Ich: »Wen hast du noch gehabt?«
Zenzi: »Meinen Schullehrer.«
Ich: »Den Lehrer ...?«
Zenzi: »Ja ..., wie ich in der vierten Klasse war.«
Ich: »Aber der hat doch nichts bezahlt?«
Zenzi: »Hör nur. Bei uns war ein Mädel, die hat schon damals dicke
Duteln gehabt, und der Lehrer hat sie immer dabei angegriffen, und sie
hat sich einen Haufen darauf eingebildet.«
Ich: »Die Gans, die blöde.«
Zenzi: »Ja, eine Gans war sie.«
Ich: »Erzähl doch, das ist lustig ..., mich hat auch der Katechet
gevögelt.«
Zenzi: »Ich weiß.«
Ich: »Also erzähl ...«
Zenzi: »Wenn Turnen war, und der Lehrer hat uns geholfen, bei die Ringe,
oder beim Klettern, da hat er eine andere immer beim Arm oder beim
Rücken gepackt, dieses Mädel aber hat er immer bei ihren Duteln
erwischt, oder wenn Klettern war, hat er sie immer beim Arsch
genommen ..., und sie war dann ganz rot im Gesicht ...«
Ich: »Das glaub' ich.«
Zenzi: »Und ich hab' mich immer hingestellt, und hab' dem Lehrer ins
Gesicht gelacht.«
Ich: »Und er?«
Zenzi: »Er ist auch rot geworden.«
Ich: »Weiter ..., ich bin schon gespannt.«
Zenzi: »Und einmal hat das Mädel nicht auf den Barren können. Der Lehrer
hat sie vorn gehalten und hinten, und endlich hat er gesagt, sie soll
nach der Schule hierbleiben, und nachturnen.«
Ich: »Aha ..., ich merke schon, was kommt.«
Zenzi: »Ja, das hab' ich auch gemerkt, und bin auch dageblieben.«
Ich: »Im Turnsaal?«
Zenzi: »Ah nein ..., ich hab' vor der Schule gewartet, bis das Mädel
fortgeht ...«
Ich: »Na, hat das lang gedauert?«
Zenzi: »Eine halbe Stunde ... Ich hab' sie begleitet und ausgefragt.«
Ich: »Hat sie dir alles gesagt?«
Zenzi: »Zuerst nicht. Erst wie ich ihr gesagt habe: Hör du, warum packt
dich denn der Lehrer immer bei den Duteln und beim Popo ...? Da ist sie
dann mit der Sprache heraus.«
Ich: »Na ..., erzähl doch schneller.«
Zenzi: »Warum denn? Wir haben ja Zeit ... Also, sie hat mir gesagt ...,
haha ..., ich muß heute noch lachen, was das für eine Gans war ...«
Ich: »Er hat sie gevögelt ...?«
Zenzi: »`Hör nur ..., der Lehrer hat was´, sagte sie ... Was denn? frug
ich. `Aber du darfst es niemanden sagen´, meint sie, na ich versprach
es ihr ..., `der Lehrer hat zwischen den Füßen einen Stöpsel´, meint sie
darauf.«
Ich: »Nein, so eine Gans ..., ein schönes Geheimnis ...«
Zenzi: »Hat er dich ihn anschauen lassen? frug ich sie. `Ja´, sagt sie.
Sie hat gar nicht gewußt, was das bedeutet. Und sie hat mir gesagt, der
Lehrer hat ihr den Stöpsel zwischen ihre Füße gerieben und zwischen ihre
Duteln gesteckt, und dann hat er ihr lauter Einser versprochen, und dann
ist so viel Wasser aus seinem Stöpsel herausgelaufen.«
Ich: »Nein ..., so ein Ganserl ..., so ein dummes.«
Zenzi: »Na, ich hab' ihr aber alles erklärt, und da ist sie gescheiter
geworden.«
Ich: »Wieso ...?«
Zenzi: »Weil sie gemeint hat: Ihr sei das Wurst, wie das Ding heiße, und
wenn sie nichts mehr lernen brauche, dann werde sie sich vom Lehrer
vögeln lassen, sooft er nur will.«
Ich: »Na, und du?«
Zenzi: »Ich hab' mir gedacht, das kann ich auch brauchen.«
Ich: »Und wie war's denn mit dir?«
Zenzi: »Na ich hab' doch auch schon damals Brüste gehabt, wenn auch nur
ganz kleine ...«
Ich: »Und die hast du ihm gezeigt.«
Zenzi: »Ja ..., wie er mir wieder hat helfen wollen, und mir untern Arm
greift, sag' ich ihm, ich bitt' Herr Lehrer, ich bin kitzlig ..., und da
nimmt er mich um die Brust ...«
Ich: »Na, das wird er doch gewußt haben, was das ist.«
Zenzi: »Das glaub' ich. Er hat mich gleich so angeschaut ..., und ich
hab' gelacht, und da sagt er mir: `Du mußt nachturnen, wenn die Schule
aus ist.´«
Ich: »Das hab' ich mir gleich gedacht ...«
Zenzi: »Wie dann alle fort sind, bin ich im finstern Ankleidezimmer
geblieben, und da kommt er zu mir und packt mich so langsam bei den
beiden Brüsten und fragt mich: `Turnst du gern?´ Ja, Herr Lehrer, sag'
ich, und drückte seine Hände an mich.«
Ich: »Da hat er doch gewußt, was Neues ist ...«
Zenzi: »Ja. Er ist mir gleich unter den Kittel, hat mich bei der Muschel
erwischt, und sagt: `Wem gehört denn das?´«
Ich: »Und was hast du gesagt?«
Zenzi: »Ich hab' mich noch dumm gestellt, und hab' gesagt: Ich weiß
nicht ...«
Ich: »Da hat er sich halt bedient.«
Zenzi: »Darauf nimmt er meine Hand und steckt sie sich ins
Hosentürl ..., und ich erwisch' seinen Notizstift, der kerzengrad parat
war. Da fragt er mich, `was ist denn das´?«
Ich: »Eine nette Prüfung. Du hast sie doch bestanden?«
Zenzi: »Ja, denn ich hab' gesagt, das ist dem Herrn Lehrer sein
Schweif.«
Ich: »Bravo. Das verdient einen Einser.«
Zenzi: »Fragt er weiter: `Zu was gehört denn das?´«
Ich: »Du hast ihm's doch gesagt?«
Zenzi: »Aber natürlich, zum brunzen und zum vögeln gehört es, hab' ich
gesagt, und da ist er ganz närrisch geworden.«
Ich: »Das glaub' ich. Das war halt anders wie bei dem dummen Ganserl.«
Zenzi: »`Na´, meint er, `willst du lauter Einser haben, dann laß mich
vögeln ..., willst du ...?´ O ja, ich will schon, gab ich zur Antwort,
aber ich brauch' nicht lauter Einser. `Was denn?´ fragt er ganz erstaunt
... ein Geld, sag' ich drauf, ein Geld! Er war ganz paff. `Ich soll dir
ein Geld geben ...?´ Ja. Ich hab' ihm ins Gesicht gelacht. `Wofür denn?´
fragt er und laßt mich los. Aber ich hab' meinen Kittel in die Höhe
gehalten, wie er von ihm aus hersah, und hab' alles hergezeigt, und
dabei sag' ich ganz keck: Wofür? Na, dafür, daß mich der Herr Lehrer
vögeln darf, und daß ich niemandem was sag'.«
Ich: »Das hat ihm eingeleuchtet?«
Zenzi: »Ja ..., und er hat gleich zum remmeln angefangen. Aber er hat
probiert, ob er mir ihn nicht hineinstecken kann. Aber das ist noch
nicht gegangen.«
Ich: »Warst du dann noch oft im Turnsaal?«
Zenzi: »Aber ja ..., und in den Mund genommen hab' ich's ihm, und er hat
mir nur fünfzig Kreuzer gegeben.«
Ich: »Und wie bist du denn da in die Stadt herein gekommen?«
Zenzi: »Nur durch den Rudolf.«
Ich: »Der kennt aber auch alles.«
Zenzi: »Ja, er hat gesagt, draußen bei uns ist ja doch kein Geschäft,
und er hat mich hergeführt.«
Ich: »Und ich bin auch da.«
Zenzi: »Ja ..., er hat immer gesagt ..., die Peperl ..., die kann was
verdienen, wenn sie gescheit ist ...«
Ich: »Das möcht' mir schon passen.«
Zenzi: »Na, du siehst ja, es geht.«
Ich: »Na, und ob das geht.«
Zenzi: »Was hast denn verdient?«
Ich: »Wart! Zwei Gulden im Haustor, fünf Gulden der Alte ..., zehn
Gulden jetzt ..., zwei Gulden muß ich der Alten geben, bleiben fünfzehn
Gulden. Na, der Vater der wird schöne Augen machen, wenn ich so viel z'
Haus bring'.«
Zenzi: »Was dir nicht einfällt, da wärst aber schön dumm ...«
Ich: »Wieso?«
Zenzi: »Du wirst doch nicht alles hergeben?«
Ich: »Nicht?«
Zenzi: »Gott bewahre. Vielleicht verdienst du morgen gar nix ..., was
machst denn dann?«
Ich: »Dann sag' ich halt, ich hab' nix verdient.«
Zenzi: »So? Und laßt dich vielleicht zusammenschimpfen ... Ah nein,
schau mich an ..., wie ich's mach. Ich geb' einmal drei Gulden, einmal
fünf, einmal sechs her, und der Rudolf freut sich, weil ich jeden Tag
was bring', und außerdem, sie möchten ja ohnedies alles gleich
versaufen.«
Ich: »Ja ..., ja ..., da hast du recht ...«
Zenzi: »Und dann, du kannst doch selber ein Geld brauchen. Hast du eins,
mußt du keins verlangen, und wenn's dich freut, kauf dir was.«
Ich: »Ja, und dann ahnt es der Vater, und weiß gleich, daß ich
geschummelt hab'.«
Zenzi: »O, du Tschapperl du ..., wenn er was sieht, dann sagst du, du
hast es von einem Herrn geschenkt gekriegt ..., immer geschenkt ..., das
ist das Beste. Und übrigens mußt du halt lieb sein zum Vater ..., immer
nur lieb sein ..., dann laßt er dir alles zu.«
Ich: »Aha! Also deswegen schmeichelst du dem Rudolf so?«
Zenzi: »Natürlich. Damit ich keinen Verdruß mit ihm hab', und machen
kann, was ich will.«
Wir kleideten uns an, beschlossen, obwohl es kaum noch dämmerte, heute
schon nach Hause zu gehen. Wir hatten beide genug, durften eines
freundlichen Empfanges sicher sein, und wollten keinen Herrn mehr
suchen. Wir fuhren mit dem Stellwagen in die Vorstadt.
Ich gab dem Vater fünf Gulden. Er sagte nichts, aber er nahm das Geld
und holte Wein. Zenzi mußte Rudolf beichten, wie ich mich angestellt
hätte. Er lobte mich. Dann begann das übliche Saufgelage, und ich lag in
dieser Nacht wieder unter meinem Vater.
So endete der erste Tag meines Hurenlebens. Ich war nun käuflich, war
ein Ding für jedermann.
Ich ging nun täglich in den ersten Nachmittagsstunden mit Zenzi oder
auch allein in die Stadt. Und das Geld, das ich verdiente, lieferte ich
prompt meinem Vater ab, der jetzt gar nicht mehr daran dachte, sich eine
Arbeit zu suchen, sondern es vorzog, auf meine Kosten zu leben und
meinen Verdienst zu vertrinken. Meine Brüder sah ich gar nicht mehr.
Franz war in Simmering, weit draußen, am entgegengesetzten Ende der
Stadt in der Lehre, und Lorenz, der die Wirtschaft, die bei uns war, von
Anfang an durchschaute, und der auch Rudolf nicht leiden mochte, ließ
sich gar nicht mehr blicken.
Von dem Geld, das ich mir behielt, kaufte ich mir heimlich hie und da
ein Stück zum anziehen oder auch zum putzen. Aber Rudolf erlaubte es
weder Zenzi noch mir, mit den guten Sachen angekleidet auf den Strich zu
gehen. Er meinte, wenn wir aufgeputzt dahergingen, werde die Polizei
aufmerksam auf uns werden und außerdem werden die Herren, die uns
nachliefen, wegbleiben, weil sie uns für konzessionierte Huren halten
würden, und weil nur die Heimlichkeit unseres Gewerbes reize.
Ich wußte nun alles, war in allen Schlichen und Pfiffen meines Metiers
bewandert, verstand mich darauf, den Wachmännern auszuweichen und sie zu
täuschen, und verstand mich auch darauf, den Leuten, mit denen ich mich
abgab, so viel Geld als möglich abzuluchsen.
Auch vor der Franzosenkrankheit war ich gewarnt und völlig darüber
aufgeklärt, wie man sie erkenne. Ich unterzog jeden Menschen, dem ich
mich hingab, einer genauen Visitation und bin heute noch froh darüber.
Denn wenn ich auch manche Erkrankung nicht ganz vermeiden konnte, so bin
ich auch davor bewahrt geblieben, die Syphilis zu erleiden. Eigentlich
wie durch ein Wunder bewahrt geblieben, wenn ich's recht bedenke, denn
ich kam schließlich in Situationen, in denen mir meine ganze Vorsicht
nichts geholfen hätte, und in denen ich hundertfach angesteckt hätte
werden können.
Rudolf habe ich in diesen Dingen viel zu danken gehabt. Er hat mich
gelehrt, auf die Männer achtzugeben, daß sie mir mit keiner Waffe nahen,
mich nicht am Halse würgen, oder mir den Mund zuhalten. Er war es, der
mir einschärfte, wenn ich mit jemandem ins Hotel oder in die Wohnung
gehe, das Geld vorher zu verlangen, und er war es, der mich davor
warnte, jemals eine Kaserne zu betreten, es sei denn zu einem Offizier.
Ich kann nicht alles aufschreiben, was ich in diesen Jahren, was ich als
Hure überhaupt erlebt habe. Meine Kindheitserinnerungen, so wechselvoll
und bewegt sie sein mögen, sie sind mir haften geblieben, und ich habe
von ihnen berichtet. Schließlich sind es Kindheitserinnerungen, wenn
auch freilich sehr geschlechtlich und sehr wenig kindlich. Aber sie
bleiben auf alle Fälle viel tiefer und dauernder in unser Gedächtnis
eingegraben wie alles, was wir später erleben.
Wenn man bedenkt, daß das Jahr 365 Tage hat, und wenn man nur, gering
gerechnet, den Tag mit drei Männern einschätzt, so macht das an
elfhundert Männer im Jahr, macht in drei Jahrzehnten wohl
dreiunddreißigtausend Männer. Es ist eine Armee. Und man wird es weder
anraten noch wünschen, daß ich von jedem dieser dreiunddreißigtausend
Schweife, die mich im Laufe der Zeit bewedelt haben, einzeln
Rechenschaft ablege.
Es ist auch gar nicht notwendig, daß ich es tu! Weder für mich, die ich
diese Blätter nur aufschreibe, um mein Leben in seinen Hauptzügen an mir
vorbeigleiten zu lassen, noch für diejenigen, die in diesen
Aufzeichnungen vielleicht nach meinem Tode blättern werden. Denn im
Ganzen ist die Liebe unsinnig. Das Weib gleicht so einer alten
Rohrpfeife, die auch nur ein paar Löcher hat und auf der man eben auch
nur ein paar Töne spielen kann. Die Männer tun alle dasselbe. Sie liegen
oben, wir liegen unten. Sie stoßen und wir werden gestoßen. Das ist der
ganze Unterschied.

HONORÉ DE BALZAC
Balzac naquit à Tours le 16 mai 1799, le jour de la fête de saint
Honoré, dont on lui donna le nom, qui parut bien sonnant et de bon
augure. Le petit Honoré ne fut pas un enfant prodige; il n'annonça pas
prématurément qu'il ferait la _Comédie humaine_. C'était un garçon
frais, vermeil, bien portant, joueur, aux yeux brillants et doux, mais
que rien ne distinguait des autres, du moins à des regards peu
attentifs. A sept ans, au sortir d'un externat de Tours, on le mit au
collége de Vendôme, tenu par des oratoriens, où il passa pour un élève
très-médiocre.
La première partie de _Louis Lambert_ contient sur ce temps de la vie de
Balzac de curieux renseignements. Dédoublant sa personnalité, il s'y
peint comme un ancien condisciple de Louis Lambert, tantôt en parlant en
son nom, et tantôt prêtant ses propres sentiments à ce personnage
imaginaire, mais pourtant très-réel, puisqu'il est une sorte d'objectif
de l'âme même de l'écrivain.
Balzac souffrit prodigieusement dans ce collége de Vendôme, où sa nature
rêveuse était meurtrie à chaque instant par une règle inflexible. Il
négligeait de faire ses devoirs; mais, favorisé par la complicité tacite
d'un répétiteur de mathématiques, en même temps bibliothécaire et occupé
de quelque ouvrage transcendental, il ne prenait pas sa leçon et
emportait les livres qu'il voulait. Tout son temps se passait à lire en
cachette. Aussi fut-il bientôt l'élève le plus puni de sa classe. Les
pensums, les retenues absorbèrent bientôt le temps des récréations; à
certaines natures d'écoliers, les châtiments inspirent une sorte de
rébellion stoïque, et ils opposent aux professeurs exaspérés la même
impassibilité dédaigneuse que les guerriers sauvages captifs aux ennemis
qui les torturent. Ni le cachot, ni la privation d'aliments, ni la
férule ne parviennent à leur arracher la moindre plainte; ce sont alors,
entre le maître et l'élève, des luttes horribles, inconnues des parents,
où la constance des martyrs et l'habileté des bourreaux se trouvent
égalées. Quelques professeurs nerveux ne peuvent supporter le regard de
haine, de mépris et de menace par lequel un bambin de huit ou dix ans
les brave.
Le résultat de ces travaux cachés, de ces méditations qui prenaient le
temps des études, fut ce fameux _Traité de la volonté_, dont il est
parlé plusieurs fois dans la _Comédie humaine_. Balzac regretta toujours
la perte de cette première oeuvre, qu'il esquisse sommairement dans
_Louis Lambert_, il dut être moins sensible à la perte de son poëme
épique sur les Incas, inspiration malencontreuse qui lui valut, tout le
temps qu'il resta au collége, le sobriquet dérisoire de Poëte. Balzac,
il faut l'avouer, n'eut jamais le don de poésie, de versification, du
moins; sa pensée si complexe resta toujours rebelle au rhythme.
A propos de vers, consignons ici un petit renseignement qui pourra
amuser les curieux littéraires. Les quelques sonnets que Lucien de
Rubempré fait voir comme échantillon de son volume de vers au libraire
Dauriat ne sont pas de Balzac, qui ne faisait pas de vers, et demandait
à ses amis ceux dont il avait besoin. Le sonnet de la _Marguerite_ est
de Mme de Girardin; le sonnet sur le _Camellia_, de Lassailly; celui
sur la _Tulipe_, de votre serviteur.
_Modeste Mignon_ renferme aussi une pièce de vers, mais nous en ignorons
l'auteur.
Pas plus dans la famille qu'au collége l'intelligence de Balzac ne fut
devinée ou comprise. Même, s'il lui échappait quelque chose d'ingénieux,
sa mère, femme supérieure cependant, lui disait: «Sans doute, Honoré, tu
ne comprends pas ce que tu dis là!» Et Balzac de rire, sans s'expliquer
davantage, de ce bon rire qu'il avait.
La famille de Balzac étant revenue à Paris, il fut mis en pension. Là,
comme au collége de Vendôme, son génie ne se décela point, et il resta
confondu parmi le troupeau des écoliers ordinaires.
Ses classes finies, Balzac se donna cette seconde éducation qui est la
vraie; il étudia, se perfectionna, suivit les cours de la Sorbonne et
fit son droit, tout en travaillant chez l'avoué et le notaire. Ce temps,
perdu en apparence, puisque Balzac ne fut ni avoué, ni notaire, ni
avocat, ni juge, lui fit connaître le personnel de la basoche et le mit
à même d'écrire plus tard, de façon à émerveiller les hommes du métier,
ce que nous pourrions appeler le contentieux de la _Comédie humaine_.
Les examens passés, la grande question de la carrière à prendre se
présenta. On voulait faire de Balzac un notaire; mais le futur grand
écrivain, qui, bien que personne ne crût à son génie, en avait la
conscience, refusa le plus respectueusement du monde, quoiqu'on lui eût
ménagé une charge à des conditions très-favorables. Son père lui accorda
deux ans pour faire ses preuves, et comme la famille retournait en
province, madame Balzac installa Honoré dans une mansarde, en lui
allouant une pension suffisante à peine aux plus stricts besoins,
espérant qu'un peu de vache enragée le rendrait plus sage.
Cette mansarde était perchée rue de Lesdiguières, nº 9, près de
l'Arsenal, dont la bibliothèque offrait ses ressources au jeune
travailleur. Sans doute passer d'une maison abondante et luxueuse à un
misérable réduit serait une chose dure à un tout autre âge qu'à vingt et
un ans, âge qui était celui de Balzac; mais si le rêve de tout enfant
est d'avoir des bottes, celui de tout jeune homme est d'avoir une
chambre, une chambre bien à lui, dont il ait la clef dans sa poche, ne
pût-il tenir debout qu'au milieu: une chambre, c'est la robe virile,
c'est l'indépendance, la personnalité, l'amour!
Voilà donc maître Honoré juché près du ciel, assis devant sa table, et
s'essayant au chef-d'oeuvre qui devait donner raison à l'indulgence de
son père et démentir les horoscopes défavorables de ses amis.--Chose
singulière, Balzac débuta par une tragédie, par un _Cromwell_! Vers ce
temps-là, à peu près, Victor Hugo mettait la dernière main à son
_Cromwell_, dont la préface fut le manifeste de la jeune école
dramatique.
A cette époque Balzac n'avait pas encore conçu le plan de l'oeuvre qui
devait l'immortaliser; il se cherchait encore avec inquiétude,
anhélation et labeur, essayant tout et ne réussissant à rien; pourtant
il possédait déjà cette opiniâtreté de travail à laquelle Minerve,
quelque revêche qu'elle soit, doit un jour ou l'autre céder; il
ébauchait des opéras-comiques, faisait des plans de comédies, de drames
et de romans. Une volonté moins robuste se fût découragée mille fois,
mais par bonheur Balzac avait une confiance inébranlable dans son génie
méconnu de tout le monde. Il voulait être un grand homme et il le fut
par d'incessantes projections de ce fluide plus puissant que
l'électricité, et dont il fait de si subtiles analyses dans _Louis
Lambert_.
Contrairement aux écrivains de l'école romantique, qui tous se
distinguèrent par une hardiesse et une facilité d'exécution étonnantes,
et produisirent leurs fruits presque en même temps que leurs fleurs,
dans une éclosion pour ainsi dire involontaire, Balzac, l'égal de tous
comme génie, ne trouvait pas son moyen d'expression, ou ne le trouvait
qu'après des peines infinies.
Fondeur obstiné, il rejetait dix ou douze fois au creuset le métal qui
n'avait pas rempli exactement le moule; comme Bernard Palissy, il eût
brûlé les meubles, le plancher et jusqu'aux poutres de sa maison pour
entretenir le feu de son fourneau et ne pas manquer l'expérience; les
nécessités les plus dures ne lui firent jamais livrer une oeuvre sur
laquelle il n'eût pas mis le dernier effort, et il donna d'admirables
exemples de conscience littéraire.
Sa manière de procéder était celle-ci: quand il avait longtemps porté et
vécu un sujet, d'une écriture rapide, heurtée, pochée, presque
hiéroglyphique, il traçait une espèce de scenario en quelques pages,
qu'il envoyait à l'imprimerie, d'où elles revenaient en placards,
c'est-à-dire en colonnes isolées au milieu de larges feuilles. Il lisait
attentivement ces placards, qui donnaient déjà à son embryon d'oeuvre ce
caractère impersonnel que n'a pas le manuscrit, et il appliquait à cette
ébauche la haute faculté critique qu'il possédait, comme s'il se fût agi
d'un autre. Il opérait sur quelque chose; s'approuvant ou se
désapprouvant, il maintenait ou corrigeait, mais surtout ajoutait. Des
lignes partant du commencement du milieu ou de la fin des phrases, se
dirigeaient vers les marges, à droite, à gauche, en haut, en bas,
conduisant à des développements, à des intercalations, à des incises, à
des épithètes, à des adverbes. Au bout de quelques heures de travail, on
eût dit le bouquet d'un feu d'artifice dessiné par un enfant.
Six, sept et parfois dix épreuves revenaient raturées, remaniées, sans
satisfaire le désir de perfection de l'auteur. Nous avons vu aux
Jardies, sur les rayons d'une bibliothèque composée de ses oeuvres
seules, chaque épreuve différente du même ouvrage reliée en un volume
séparé, depuis le premier jet jusqu'au livre définitif; la comparaison
de la pensée de Balzac à ses divers états offrirait une étude bien
curieuse et contiendrait de profitables leçons littéraires.
Balzac, comme Vichnou, le dieu indien, possédait le don d'_avatar_,
c'est-à-dire celui de s'incarner dans des corps différents et d'y vivre
le temps qu'il voulait; seulement le nombre des _avatars_ de Vichnou est
fixé à dix, ceux de Balzac ne se comptent pas, et de plus il pouvait les
provoquer à volonté.--Quoique cela semble singulier en plein
dix-neuvième siècle, Balzac fut un _voyant_. Son mérite d'observateur,
sa perspicacité de physiologiste, son génie d'écrivain, ne suffisent pas
pour expliquer l'infinie variété des deux ou trois mille types qui
jouent un rôle plus ou moins important dans la _Comédie humaine_. Il ne
les copiait pas, il les vivait idéalement, revêtait leurs habits,
contractait leurs habitudes, s'entourait de leur milieu, était eux-mêmes
tout le temps nécessaire. De là viennent ces personnages soutenus,
logiques, ne se démentant et ne s'oubliant jamais, doués d'une existence
intime et profonde, qui, pour nous servir d'une de ses expressions, font
concurrence à l'état civil. Un véritable sang rouge circule dans leurs
veines, au lieu de l'encre qu'infusent à leurs créations les auteurs
ordinaires.
Cette faculté, Balzac ne la possédait d'ailleurs que pour le présent. Il
pouvait transporter sa pensée dans un marquis, dans un financier, dans
un bourgeois, dans un homme du peuple, dans une femme du monde, dans une
courtisane; mais les ombres du passé n'obéissaient pas à son appel: il
ne sut jamais, comme Goethe, évoquer du fond de l'antiquité la belle
Hélène et lui faire habiter le manoir gothique de Faust. Sauf deux ou
trois exceptions, toute son oeuvre est moderne; il s'était assimilé les
vivants, il ne ressuscitait pas les morts.
L'on a fait nombre de critiques sur Balzac et parlé de lui de bien des
façons, mais on n'a pas insisté sur un point très-caractéristique à
notre avis;--ce point est la modernité absolue de son génie. Balzac ne
doit rien à l'antiquité;--pour lui il n'y a ni Grecs ni Romains, et il
n'a pas besoin de crier qu'on l'en délivre. Balzac, comme Gavarni, a vu
ses contemporains; et dans l'art, la difficulté suprême c'est de peindre
ce qu'on a devant les yeux.
Cette profonde compréhension des choses modernes rendait, il faut le
dire, Balzac peu sensible à la beauté plastique. Il lisait d'un oeil
négligent les blanches strophes de marbre où l'art grec chanta la
perfection de la forme humaine. Dans le musée des antiques, il regardait
la Vénus de Milo sans grande extase; mais la Parisienne arrêtée devant
l'immortelle statue, drapée de son long cachemire filant sans un pli de
la nuque au talon, coiffée de son chapeau à voilette de Chantilly,
gantée de son étroit gant Jouvin, avançant sous l'ourlet de sa robe à
volants le bout verni de sa bottine claquée, faisait pétiller son oeil
de plaisir. Il en analysait les coquettes allures, il en dégustait
longuement les grâces savantes, tout en trouvant comme elle que la
déesse avait la taille bien lourde et ne ferait pas bonne figure chez
Mmes de Beauséant, de Listomère ou d'Espard. La beauté idéale, avec ses
lignes sereines et pures, était trop simple, trop froide, trop une, pour
ce génie compliqué, touffu et divers.--Aussi dit-il quelque part: «Il
faut être Raphaël pour faire beaucoup de Vierges.»--Le _caractère_ lui
plaisait plus que le _style_, et il préférait la physionomie à la
beauté. Dans ses portraits de femme, il ne manque jamais de mettre un
signe, un pli, une ride, une plaque rose, un coin attendri et fatigué,
une veine trop apparente, quelque détail indiquant les meurtrissures de
la vie, qu'un poëte, traçant la même image, eût à coup sûr supprimé, à
tort sans doute.
Avec son profond instinct de la réalité, Balzac comprit que la vie
moderne qu'il voulait peindre était dominée par un grand
fait,--l'argent,--et dans _la Peau de chagrin_, il eut le courage de
représenter un amant inquiet non-seulement de savoir s'il a touché le
coeur de celle qu'il aime, mais encore s'il aura assez de monnaie pour
payer le fiacre dans lequel il la reconduit.--Cette audace est peut-être
une des plus grandes qu'on se soit permises en littérature, et seule
elle suffirait pour immortaliser Balzac. La stupéfaction fut profonde,
et les purs s'indignèrent de cette infraction aux lois du genre, mais
tous les jeunes gens qui, allant en soirée chez quelque belle dame avec
des gants blancs repassés à la gomme élastique, avaient traversé Paris
en danseurs, sur la pointe de leurs escarpins, redoutant une mouche de
boue plus qu'un coup de pistolet, compatirent, pour les avoir éprouvées,
aux angoisses de Valentin, et s'intéressèrent vivement à ce chapeau
qu'il ne peut renouveler et conserve avec des soins si minutieux. Aux
moments de misère suprême, la trouvaille d'une des pièces de cent sous
glissées entre les papiers du tiroir par la pudique commisération de
Pauline produisait l'effet des coups de théâtre les plus romanesques ou
de l'intervention d'une péri dans les contes arabes. Qui n'a pas
découvert aux jours de détresse, oublié dans un pantalon ou dans un
gilet, quelque glorieux écu apparaissant à propos et vous sauvant du
malheur que la jeunesse redoute le plus: rester en affront devant une
femme aimée pour une voiture, un bouquet, un petit banc, un programme de
spectacle, une gratification à l'ouvreuse ou quelque vétille de ce
genre?
Balzac excelle d'ailleurs dans la peinture de la jeunesse pauvre, comme
elle l'est presque toujours, s'essayant aux premières luttes de la vie,
en proie aux tentations des plaisirs et du luxe, et supportant de
profondes misères à l'aide de hautes espérances. Valentin, Rastignac,
Bianchon, d'Arthez, Lucien de Rubempré, Lousteau, ont tous tiré à belles
dents dans les durs biftecks de la vache enragée, nourriture fortifiante
pour les estomacs robustes, indigeste pour les estomacs débiles; il ne
les loge pas, tous ces beaux jeunes gens sans le sou, dans des mansardes
de convention tendues de perse, à fenêtre festonnée de pois de senteur
et donnant sur des jardins; il ne leur fait pas manger «des mets
simples, apprêtés par les mains de la nature,» et ne les habille pas de
vêtements sans luxe, mais propres et commodes; il les met en pension
bourgeoise chez la maman Vauquer, ou les accroupit sous l'angle aigu
d'un toit, les accoude aux tables grasses des gargottes infimes, les
affuble d'habits noirs aux coutures grises, et ne craint pas de les
envoyer au mont-de-piété, s'ils ont encore, chose rare, la montre de
leur père.
O Corinne, toi qui laisses, au cap Mysène, pendre ton bras de neige sur
ta lyre d'ivoire, tandis que le fils d'Albion, drapé d'un superbe
manteau neuf et chaussé de bottes à coeur parfaitement cirées, te
contemple et t'écoute dans une pose élégante; Corinne, qu'aurais-tu dit
de semblables héros? Ils ont pourtant une petite qualité qui manquait à
Oswald,--ils vivent, et d'une vie si forte qu'il semble qu'on les ait
rencontrés mille fois;--aussi Pauline, Delphine de Nucingen, la
princesse de Cadignan, Mme de Bargeton, Coralie, Esther, en sont-elles
follement éprises.
De cette _modernité_ sur laquelle nous appuyons à dessein provenait,
sans qu'il s'en doutât, la difficulté de travail qu'éprouvait Balzac
dans l'accomplissement de son oeuvre: la langue française épurée par les
classiques du dix-septième siècle n'est propre, lorsqu'on veut s'y
conformer, qu'à rendre des idées générales, et qu'à peindre des figures
conventionnelles dans un milieu vague. Pour exprimer cette multiplicité
de détails, de caractères, de types, d'architectures, d'ameublements,
Balzac fut obligé de se forger une langue spéciale, composée de toutes
les technologies, de tous les argots de la science, de l'atelier, des
coulisses, de l'amphithéâtre même. Chaque mot qui disait quelque chose
était le bienvenu, et la phrase, pour le recevoir, ouvrait une incise,
une parenthèse, et s'allongeait complaisamment.--C'est ce qui a fait
dire aux critiques superficiels que Balzac ne savait pas écrire.--Il
avait, bien qu'il ne le crût pas, un style et un très-beau style,--le
style nécessaire, fatal et mathématique de son idée!
Nous glisserons légèrement sur le temps de sa vie où il essaya de
s'assurer l'indépendance par des spéculations de librairie, auxquelles
ne manquèrent que des capitaux pour être heureuses. Ces tentatives
l'endettèrent, engagèrent son avenir, et, malgré les secours dévoués,
mais trop tardifs peut-être de la famille, lui imposèrent ce rocher de
Sisyphe qu'il remonta tant de fois jusqu'au bord du plateau, et qui
retombait toujours plus écrasant sur ses épaules d'Atlas, chargées en
outre de tout un monde.
Cette dette qu'il se faisait un devoir sacré d'acquitter, car elle
représentait la fortune d'êtres chers, fut la Nécessité au fouet armé de
pointes, à la main pleine de clous de bronze, qui le harcela nuit et
jour, sans trêve ni pitié, lui faisant regarder comme un vol une heure
de repos ou de distraction. Elle domina douloureusement toute sa vie, et
la rendit souvent inexplicable pour qui n'en possédait pas le secret.
Après la mansarde de la rue de Lesdiguières, Balzac, qui commençait à
devenir célèbre, alla habiter à Chaillot, rue des Batailles, une maison
d'où l'on découvrait une vue admirable, le cours de la Seine, le champ
de Mars, l'école militaire, le dôme des Invalides, une grande portion de
Paris et plus loin les coteaux de Meudon. Il s'était arrangé un
intérieur assez luxueux, car il savait qu'à Paris on ne croit guère au
talent pauvre, et que _le paraître_ y amène souvent l'_être_.
C'est à cette période que se rapportent ses velléités d'élégance et de
dandysme, le fameux habit bleu à boutons d'or massif, la massue à
pommeau de turquoises, les apparitions aux Bouffes et à l'Opéra, et les
visites plus fréquentes dans le monde, où sa verve étincelante le
faisait rechercher, visites utiles d'ailleurs, car il y rencontra plus
d'un modèle. Il n'était pas facile de pénétrer dans cette maison, mieux
gardée que le jardin des Hespérides. Deux ou trois mots de passe étaient
exigés. Balzac, de peur qu'ils ne s'ébruitassent, les changeait souvent.
Nous nous souvenons de ceux-ci: Au portier l'on disait: «La saison des
prunes est arrivée,» et il vous laissait franchir le seuil; au
domestique accouru sur l'escalier au son de la cloche, il fallait
murmurer: «j'apporte des dentelles de Belgique,» et si vous assuriez au
valet de chambre que «madame Bertrand était en bonne santé,» on vous
introduisait enfin.
Ces enfantillages amusaient beaucoup Balzac; ils étaient peut-être
nécessaires pour écarter les fâcheux et d'autres visiteurs plus
désagréables encore.
Un des rêves de Balzac était l'amitié héroïque et dévouée, deux âmes,
deux courages, deux intelligences fondues dans la même volonté.
Il voulut former une association dans le goût de celle qui réunissait
Ferragus, Montriveau, Ronquerolles et leurs compagnons. Seulement il ne
s'agissait pas de coups si hardis; un certain nombre d'amis devaient se
prêter aide et secours en toute occasion et travailler, selon leurs
forces, au succès ou à la fortune de celui qui serait désigné, à charge
de revanche, bien entendu. Fort infatué de son projet, Balzac recruta
quelques affiliés qu'il ne mit en rapport les uns avec les autres qu'en
prenant des précautions, comme s'il se fût agi d'une société politique
ou d'une _vente_ de carbonari.
L'association, qui comptait parmi ses membres, G. de C., L. G., L. D.,
J. S., Merle, qu'on appelait le beau Merle, nous et quelques autres
qu'il est inutile de désigner, s'appelait _le Cheval rouge_. Lorsqu'il
fallait concerter quelque projet, convenir de certaines démarches,
Balzac, élu par acclamation grand maître de l'ordre, envoyait par un
affidé à chaque _cheval_ (c'était le nom argotique que prenaient les
membres entre eux) une lettre dans laquelle était dessiné un petit
cheval rouge avec ces mots; «Écurie, tel jour, tel endroit;» le lieu
changeait chaque fois, de peur d'éveiller la curiosité ou le soupçon.
Dans le monde, quoique nous nous connussions tous et de longue main pour
la plupart, nous devions éviter de nous parler ou ne nous aborder que
froidement, pour écarter toute idée de connivence.
Après quatre ou cinq réunions, _le Cheval rouge_ cessa d'exister, la
plupart des chevaux n'avaient pas de quoi payer leur avoine à la
mangeoire symbolique; et l'association qui devait s'emparer de tout fut
dissoute, parce que ses membres manquaient souvent de quinze francs,
prix de l'écot.
Désarçonné d'une chimère, Balzac en remontait bien vite une nouvelle, et
il repartait pour un autre voyage dans le bleu, avec cette naïveté
d'enfant qui chez lui s'alliait à la sagacité la plus profonde et à
l'esprit le plus retors.
Les _Jardies_ préoccupèrent beaucoup l'attention publique, lorsque
Balzac les acheta, dans l'intention honorable de constituer un gage à sa
mère. En passant en wagon sur le chemin de fer qui longe Ville-d'Avray,
chacun regardait avec curiosité cette petite maison, moitié cottage,
moitié chalet, qui se dressait au milieu d'un terrain en pente et
d'apparence glaiseuse.
Ce terrain, selon Balzac, était le meilleur du monde; autrefois,
prétendait-il, un certain cru célèbre y poussait et les raisins, grâce à
une exposition sans pareille, s'y cuisaient comme les grappes de Tokay
sur les coteaux de Bohême. Le soleil, il est vrai, avait toute liberté
de mûrir la vendange en ce lieu, où il n'existait qu'un seul arbre.
Balzac essaya d'enclore cette propriété de murs, qui devinrent fameux
par leur obstination à s'écrouler ou à glisser tout d'une pièce sur
l'escarpement trop abrupt, et il rêvait pour cet endroit privilégié du
ciel, les cultures les plus fabuleuses et les plus exotiques. Ici se
place naturellement l'anecdote des ananas, qu'ont a si souvent répétée
que nous ne la redirions pas, si nous ne pouvions y ajouter un trait
vraiment caractéristique.--Voici le projet: cent mille pieds d'ananas
étaient plantés dans le clos des Jardies, métamorphosé en serres qui
n'exigeraient qu'un médiocre chauffage, vu la torridité du site. Les
ananas devaient être vendus cinq francs au lieu d'un louis qu'ils
coûtent ordinairement, soit cinq cent mille francs; il fallait déduire
de ce prix cent mille francs pour les frais de culture, de châssis, de
charbon; restaient donc quatre cent mille francs nets, qui constituaient
à l'heureux propriétaire une rente splendide,--«sans la moindre copie,»
ajoutait-il.--Ceci n'est rien, Balzac eut mille projets de ce genre;
mais le beau est que nous cherchâmes ensemble, sur le boulevard
Montmartre, une boutique pour la vente des ananas encore en germe. La
boutique devait être peinte en noir et rechampie de filets d'or, et
porter sur son enseigne en lettres énormes: ANANAS DES JARDIES. Il se
rendit pourtant à notre conseil, de ne louer sa boutique que l'année
suivante, pour éviter des frais inutiles.
Les magnificences des Jardies n'existaient guère qu'à l'état de
rêve. Tous les amis de Balzac se souviennent d'avoir vu écrit
au charbon sur les murs nus plaqués de papier gris: «boiseries de
palissandre,--tapisserie des Gobelins,--glaces de Venise,--tableaux de
Raphaël.» Gérard de Nerval avait déjà décoré un appartement de cette
manière, et cela ne nous étonnait pas. Quant à Balzac, il se croyait
littéralement dans l'or, le marbre et la soie; mais, s'il n'acheva pas
les Jardies et s'il prêta à rire par ses chimères, il sut du moins se
bâtir une demeure éternelle, un monument «plus durable que l'airain,»
une cité immense, peuplée de ses créations et dorée par les rayons de sa
gloire.
Personne ne peut avoir la prétention de faire une biographie complète de
Balzac; toute liaison avec lui étant nécessairement coupée de lacunes,
d'absences, de disparitions. Le travail commandait absolument la vie de
Balzac, et si, comme il le dit lui-même avec un accent de touchante
sensibilité dans une lettre à sa soeur, il a sacrifié sans peine à ce
dieu jaloux les joies et les distractions de l'existence, il lui en a
coûté de renoncer à tout commerce un peu suivi d'amitié. Répondre
quelques mots à une longue missive devenait pour lui, dans ses
accablements de besogne, une prodigalité qu'il pouvait rarement se
permettre; il était l'esclave de son oeuvre et l'esclave volontaire. Il
avait, avec un coeur très-bon et très-tendre, l'égoïsme du grand
travailleur. Et qui eût songé à lui en vouloir de négligences forcées et
d'oublis apparents, lorsqu'on voyait les résultats de ses fuites ou de
ses réclusions? Quand, l'oeuvre parachevée, il reparaissait, on eût dit
qu'il vous eût quitté la veille, et il reprenait la conversation
interrompue, comme si quelquefois six mois et plus ne se fussent pas
écoulés. Il faisait des voyages en France pour étudier les localités où
il plaçait ses _Scènes de province_, et se retirait chez des amis, en
Touraine, ou dans la Charente, trouvant là un calme que ses créanciers
ne lui laissaient pas toujours à Paris. Après quelque grand ouvrage, il
se permettait parfois une excursion plus longue, en Allemagne, dans la
haute Italie ou en Suisse; mais ces courses faites rapidement, avec des
préoccupations d'échéances à payer, de traites à remplir, et un viatique
assez borné, le fatiguaient peut-être plus qu'elles ne le reposaient.
Passons maintenant à quelques détails plus intimes. Le grand Goethe
avait trois choses en horreur: une de ces choses était la fumée de
tabac; on nous dispensera de dire les deux autres. Balzac, comme le
Jupiter de l'Olympe poétique allemand, ne pouvait souffrir le tabac sous
quelque forme que ce fût; il ne fuma jamais. Toutes les fois que Balzac
est obligé, pour la vraisemblance du récit, de laisser un de ses
personnages s'adonner à cette habitude horrible du tabac, sa phrase
brève et dédaigneuse trahit un secret blâme: «Quant à de Marsay, dit-il,
il était occupé à fumer ses cigares.» Et il faut qu'il aime bien ce
condottiere du dandysme pour lui permettre de fumer dans son oeuvre.
Une femme délicate et petite-maîtresse avait sans doute imposé cette
aversion à Balzac. C'est un point que nous ne saurions résoudre.
Toujours est-il qu'il ne fit pas gagner un sou à la régie. A propos de
femmes, Balzac, qui les a si bien peintes, devait les connaître, et l'on
sait le sens que la Bible attache à ce mot. Dans une des lettres qu'il
écrit à madame de Surville, sa soeur, Balzac, tout jeune et complétement
ignoré, pose l'idéal de sa vie en deux mots: «être célèbre et être
aimé.» La première partie de ce programme, que se tracent du reste tous
les artistes, a été réalisée de point en point. La seconde a-t-elle reçu
son accomplissement? L'opinion des plus intimes amis de Balzac est qu'il
pratiqua la chasteté qu'il recommandait aux autres, et n'eut que des
amours platoniques; mais madame de Surville sourit à cette idée, avec un
sourire d'une finesse féminine et tout plein de pudiques réticences.
Elle prétend que son frère était d'une discrétion à toute épreuve, et
que s'il eût voulu parler, il eût eu beaucoup de choses à dire. Cela
doit être, et sans doute la cassette de Balzac contenait plus de petites
lettres à l'écriture fine et penchée que la boîte en laque de Canalis.
Il y a dans son oeuvre comme une odeur de femme: _odor di femina_. Quand
on y entre, on entend, derrière les portes qui se referment, sur les
marches de l'escalier dérobé, des frou-frou de soie et des craquements
de bottines. Le salon semi-circulaire et matelassé de la rue des
Batailles, dont la description est placée par l'auteur dans _la Fille
aux yeux d'or_, ne resta donc pas complétement virginal, comme plusieurs
de nous le supposèrent. Dans le cours de notre intimité, qui dura de
1836 jusqu'à sa mort, une seule fois Balzac fit allusion, avec les
termes les plus respectueux et les plus attendris, à un attachement de
sa première jeunesse, et encore ne nous livra-t-il que le prénom de la
personne dont, après tant d'années, le souvenir lui faisait les yeux
humides. Nous en eût-il dit davantage, nous n'abuserions certes pas de
ses confidences; le génie d'un grand écrivain appartient à tout le
monde, mais son coeur est à lui.
N'allez pas vous imaginer d'après cela que Balzac fût austère et
pudibond en paroles: l'auteur des _Contes drolatiques_ était trop nourri
de Rabelais et trop pantagruéliste pour ne pas avoir le mot pour rire;
il savait de bonnes histoires et en inventait: ses grasses gaillardises
entrelardées de crudités gauloises eussent fait crier _shocking_ au
_cant_ épouvanté; mais ses lèvres rieuses et bavardes étaient scellées
comme le tombeau lorsqu'il s'agissait d'un sentiment sérieux. A peine
laissa-t-il deviner à ses plus chers son amour pour une étrangère de
distinction, amour dont on peut parler, puisqu'il fut couronné par le
mariage. C'est à cette passion conçue depuis longtemps qu'il faut
rapporter ses excursions lointaines, dont le but resta jusqu'au dernier
jour un mystère pour ses amis.
Balzac avait quitté la rue des Batailles pour les Jardies; il alla
ensuite demeurer à Passy. La maison qu'il habitait, située sur une pente
abrupte, offrait une disposition architecturale assez singulière.--On y
entrait:
  Un peu comme le vin entre dans les bouteilles.
Il fallait _descendre_ trois étages pour arriver au premier.
Vers cette époque, Balzac commença à manifester du goût pour les vieux
meubles, les bahuts, les potiches; le moindre morceau de bois vermoulu
qu'il achetait rue de Lappe avait toujours une provenance illustre, et
il faisait des généalogies circonstanciées à ses moindres biblots.--Il
les cachait çà et là, toujours à cause de ces créanciers fantastiques
dont nous commencions à douter. Nous nous amusâmes même à répandre le
bruit que Balzac était millionnaire.
Ce qui donnait quelque vraisemblance à notre plaisanterie, c'était la
nouvelle demeure qu'habitait Balzac, rue Fortunée, dans le quartier
Beaujon, moins peuplé alors qu'il ne l'est aujourd'hui. Il occupait une
petite maison mystérieuse qui avait abrité les fantaisies du fastueux
financier. Du dehors on apercevait au-dessus du mur une sorte de coupole
repoussée par le plafond cintré d'un boudoir, et la peinture fraîche des
volets fermés.
Quand on pénétrait dans ce réduit, ce qui n'était pas facile, car le
maître du logis se celait avec un soin extrême, on y découvrait mille
détails de luxe et de confort en contradiction avec la pauvreté qu'il
affectait.--Il nous reçut pourtant un jour, et nous pûmes voir une salle
à manger revêtue de vieux chêne, avec une table, une cheminée, des
buffets, des crédences et des chaises en bois sculpté à faire envie à
Berruguette, à Cornejo Duque et à Verbruggen; un salon de damas bouton
d'or, à portes, à corniches, à plinthes et embrasures d'ébène; une
bibliothèque rangée dans des armoires incrustées d'écaille et de cuivre
en style de Boule; une salle de bain en brèche jaune, avec bas-reliefs
de stuc; un boudoir en dôme, dont les peintures anciennes avaient été
restaurées par Edmond Hédouin; une galerie éclairée de haut, que nous
reconnûmes plus tard dans la collection du _Cousin Pons_.
«Vous avez donc vidé un des silos d'Aboulcasem? dîmes-nous en riant à
Balzac en face de ces splendeurs; vous voyez bien que nous avions raison
en vous prétendant millionnaire.
--Je suis plus pauvre que jamais, répondait-il en prenant un air humble
et papelard; rien de tout cela n'est à moi. J'ai meublé la maison pour
un ami qu'on attend.--Je ne suis que le gardien et le portier de
l'hôtel!»
Nous citons là ses paroles textuelles. Cette réponse, il la fit
d'ailleurs à plusieurs personnes étonnées comme nous. Le mystère
s'expliqua bientôt par le mariage de Balzac avec la femme qu'il aimait
depuis longtemps.
Il y a un proverbe turc qui dit. «Quand la maison est finie, la mort
entre.» C'est pour cela que les sultans ont toujours un palais en
construction qu'ils se gardent bien d'achever. La vie semble ne vouloir
rien de complet--que le malheur. Rien n'est redoutable comme un souhait
réalisé.
Les fameuses dettes étaient enfin payées, l'union rêvée accomplie, le
nid pour le bonheur ouaté et garni de duvet; comme s'ils eussent
pressenti sa fin prochaine, les envieux de Balzac commençaient à le
louer: les _Parents pauvres_, le _Cousin Pons_, où le génie de l'auteur
brille de tout son éclat, ralliaient tous les suffrages.--C'était trop
beau; il ne lui restait plus qu'à mourir.
Sa maladie fit de rapides progrès, mais personne ne croyait à un
dénoûment fatal, tant on avait confiance dans l'athlétique organisation
de Balzac. Nous pensions fermement qu'il nous enterrerait tous.
Huit ans déjà se sont écoulés depuis la mort de Balzac[1]. La postérité
a commencé pour lui; chaque jour il semble plus grand. Lorsqu'il était
mêlé à ses contemporains, on l'appréciait mal, on ne le voyait que par
fragments, sous des aspects parfois défavorables: maintenant l'édifice
qu'il a bâti s'élève à mesure qu'on s'en éloigne, comme la cathédrale
d'une ville que masquaient les maisons voisines, et qui à l'horizon se
dessine immense au-dessus des toits aplatis. Le monument n'est pas
achevé; mais tel qu'il est, il effraye par son énormité, et les
générations surprises se demanderont quel est le géant qui a soulevé
seul ces blocs formidables et monté si haut cette Babel où bourdonne
toute une société.
  [1] 18 août 1850.
Quoique mort, Balzac a pourtant encore des détracteurs; on jette à sa
mémoire ce reproche banal d'immoralité, dernière injure de la médiocrité
impuissante et jalouse, ou même de la pure bêtise. L'auteur de la
_Comédie humaine_, non-seulement n'est pas immoral, mais c'est même un
moraliste austère. Monarchique et catholique, il défend l'autorité,
exalte la religion, prêche le devoir, morigène la passion, et n'admet le
bonheur que dans le mariage et la famille.
  THÉOPHILE GAUTIER.
AVANT-PROPOS
En donnant à une oeuvre entreprise depuis bientôt treize ans, le titre
de _La Comédie humaine_, il est nécessaire d'en dire la pensée, d'en
raconter l'origine, d'en expliquer brièvement le plan, en essayant de
parler de ces choses comme si je n'y étais pas intéressé. Ceci n'est pas
aussi difficile que le public pourrait le penser. Peu d'oeuvres donne
beaucoup d'amour-propre, beaucoup de travail donne infiniment de
modestie. Cette observation rend compte des examens que Corneille,
Molière et autres grands auteurs faisaient de leurs ouvrages: s'il est
impossible de les égaler dans leurs belles conceptions, on peut vouloir
leur ressembler en ce sentiment.
L'idée première de _la Comédie humaine_ fut d'abord chez moi comme un
rêve, comme un de ces projets impossibles que l'on caresse et qu'on
laisse s'envoler; une chimère qui sourit, qui montre son visage de femme
et qui déploie aussitôt ses ailes en remontant dans un ciel fantastique.
Mais la chimère, comme beaucoup de chimères, se change en réalité, elle
a ses commandements et sa tyrannie auxquels il faut céder.
Cette idée vint d'une comparaison entre l'Humanité et l'Animalité.
Ce serait une erreur de croire que la grande querelle qui, dans ces
derniers temps, s'est émue entre Cuvier et Geoffroi Saint-Hilaire,
reposait sur une innovation scientifique. L'_unité de composition_
occupait déjà sous d'autres termes les plus grands esprits des deux
siècles précédents. En relisant les oeuvres si extraordinaires des
écrivains mystiques qui se sont occupés des sciences dans leurs
relations avec l'infini, tels que Swedenborg, Saint-Martin, etc., et les
écrits des plus beaux génies en histoire naturelle, tels que Leibnitz,
Buffon, Charles Bonnet, etc., on trouve dans les monades de Leibnitz,
dans les molécules organiques de Buffon, dans la force végétatrice de
Needham, dans l'_emboîtement_ des parties similaires de Charles Bonnet,
assez hardi pour écrire en 1760: _L'animal végète comme la plante_; on
trouve, dis-je, les rudiments de la belle loi du _soi pour soi_ sur
laquelle repose l'_unité de composition_. Il n'y a qu'un animal. Le
créateur ne s'est servi que d'un seul et même patron pour tous les êtres
organisés. L'animal est un principe qui prend sa forme extérieure, ou,
pour parler plus exactement, les différences de sa forme, dans les
milieux où il est appelé à se développer. Les Espèces Zoologiques
résultent de ces différences. La proclamation et le soutien de ce
système, en harmonie d'ailleurs avec les idées que nous nous faisons de
la puissance divine, sera l'éternel honneur de Geoffroi Saint-Hilaire,
le vainqueur de Cuvier sur ce point de la haute science, et dont le
triomphe a été salué par le dernier article qu'écrivit le grand Goethe.
Pénétré de ce système bien avant les débats auxquels il a donné lieu, je
vis que, sous ce rapport, la Société ressemblait à la Nature. La Société
ne fait-elle pas de l'homme, suivant les milieux où son action se
déploie, autant d'hommes différents qu'il y a de variétés en zoologie?
Les différences entre un soldat, un ouvrier, un administrateur, un
avocat, un oisif, un savant, un homme d'état, un commerçant, un marin,
un poëte, un pauvre, un prêtre, sont, quoique plus difficiles à saisir,
aussi considérables que celles qui distinguent le loup, le lion, l'âne,
le corbeau, le requin, le veau marin, la brebis, etc. Il a donc existé,
il existera donc de tout temps des Espèces Sociales comme il y a des
Espèces Zoologiques. Si Buffon a fait un magnifique ouvrage en essayant
de représenter dans un livre l'ensemble de la zoologie, n'y avait-il pas
une oeuvre de ce genre à faire pour la société? Mais la Nature a posé,
pour les variétés animales, des bornes entre lesquelles la Société ne
devait pas se tenir. Quand Buffon peignait le lion, il achevait la
lionne en quelques phrases; tandis que dans la Société la femme ne se
trouve pas toujours être la femelle du mâle. Il peut y avoir deux êtres
parfaitement dissemblables dans un ménage. La femme d'un marchand est
quelquefois digne d'être celle d'un prince, et souvent celle d'un prince
ne vaut pas celle d'un artiste. L'État Social a des hasards que ne se
permet pas la Nature, car il est la Nature plus la Société. La
description des Espèces Sociales était donc au moins double de celle des
Espèces Animales, à ne considérer que les deux sexes. Enfin, entre les
animaux, il y a peu de drames, la confusion ne s'y met guère; ils
courent sus les uns aux autres, voilà tout. Les hommes courent bien
aussi les uns sur les autres; mais leur plus ou moins d'intelligence
rend le combat autrement compliqué. Si quelques savants n'admettent pas
encore que l'Animalité se transborde dans l'Humanité par un immense
courant de vie, l'épicier devient certainement pair de France, et le
noble descend parfois au dernier rang social. Puis, Buffon a trouvé la
vie excessivement simple chez les animaux. L'animal a peu de mobilier,
il n'a ni arts ni sciences; tandis que l'homme, par une loi qui est à
rechercher, tend à représenter ses moeurs, sa pensée et sa vie dans tout
ce qu'il approprie à ses besoins. Quoique Leuwenhoëc, Swammerdam,
Spallanzani, Réaumur, Charles Bonnet, Muller, Haller et autres patients
zoographes aient démontré combien les moeurs des animaux étaient
intéressantes, les habitudes de chaque animal sont, à nos yeux du moins,
constamment semblables en tout temps; tandis que les habitudes, les
vêtements, les paroles, les demeures d'un prince, d'un banquier, d'un
artiste, d'un bourgeois, d'un prêtre et d'un pauvre sont entièrement
dissemblables et changent au gré des civilisations.
Ainsi l'oeuvre à faire devait avoir une triple forme: les hommes, les
femmes et les choses, c'est-à-dire les personnes et la représentation
matérielle qu'ils donnent de leur pensée; enfin l'homme et la vie.
En lisant les sèches et rebutantes nomenclatures de faits appelées
_histoires_, qui ne s'est aperçu que les écrivains ont oublié, dans tous
les temps, en Égypte, en Perse, en Grèce, à Rome, de nous donner
l'histoire des moeurs. Le morceau de Pétrone sur la vie privée des
Romains irrite plutôt qu'il ne satisfait notre curiosité. Après avoir
remarqué cette immense lacune dans le champ de l'histoire, l'abbé
Barthélemy consacra sa vie à refaire les moeurs grecques dans
Anacharsis.
Mais comment rendre intéressant le drame à trois ou quatre mille
personnages que présente une Société? comment plaire à la fois au poëte,
au philosophe et aux masses qui veulent la poésie et la philosophie sous
de saisissantes images? Si je concevais l'importance et la poésie de
cette histoire du coeur humain, je ne voyais aucun moyen d'exécution;
car, jusqu'à notre époque, les plus célèbres conteurs avaient dépensé
leur talent à créer un ou deux personnages typiques, à peindre une face
de la vie. Ce fut avec cette pensée que je lus les oeuvres de Walter
Scott. Walter Scott, ce trouveur (trouvère) moderne, imprimait alors une
allure gigantesque à un genre de composition injustement appelé
secondaire. N'est-il pas véritablement plus difficile de faire
concurrence à l'État-Civil avec Daphnis et Chloë, Roland, Amadis,
Panurge, Don Quichotte, Manon Lescaut, Clarisse, Lovelace, Robinson
Crusoë, Gilblas, Ossian, Julie d'Étanges, mon oncle Tobie, Werther,
René, Corinne, Adolphe, Paul et Virginie, Jeanie Dean, Claverhouse,
Ivanhoë, Manfred, Mignon, que de mettre en ordre les faits à peu près
les mêmes chez toutes les nations, de rechercher l'esprit de lois
tombées en désuétude, de rédiger des théories qui égarent les peuples,
ou, comme certains métaphysiciens, d'expliquer ce qui est? D'abord,
presque toujours ces personnages, dont l'existence devient plus longue,
plus authentique que celle des générations au milieu desquelles on les
fait naître, ne vivent qu'à la condition d'être une grande image du
présent. Conçus dans les entrailles de leur siècle, tout le coeur humain
se remue sous leur enveloppe, il s'y cache souvent toute une
philosophie. Walter Scott élevait donc à la valeur philosophique de
l'histoire le roman, cette littérature qui, de siècle en siècle,
incruste d'immortels diamants la couronne poétique des pays où se
cultivent les lettres. Il y mettait l'esprit des anciens temps, il y
réunissait à la fois le drame, le dialogue, le portrait, le paysage, la
description; il y faisait entrer le merveilleux et le vrai, ces éléments
de l'épopée, il y faisait coudoyer la poésie par la familiarité des plus
humbles langages. Mais, ayant moins imaginé un système que trouvé sa
manière dans le feu du travail ou par la logique de ce travail, il
n'avait pas songé à relier ses compositions l'une à l'autre de manière à
coordonner une histoire complète, dont chaque chapitre eût été un roman,
et chaque roman une époque. En apercevant ce défaut de liaison, qui
d'ailleurs ne rend pas l'Écossais moins grand, je vis à la fois le
système favorable à l'exécution de mon ouvrage et la possibilité de
l'exécuter. Quoique, pour ainsi dire, ébloui par la fécondité
surprenante de Walter Scott, toujours semblable à lui-même et toujours
original, je ne fus pas désespéré, car je trouvai la raison de ce talent
dans l'infinie variété de la nature humaine. Le hasard est le plus grand
romancier du monde: pour être fécond, il n'y a qu'à l'étudier. La
Société française allait être l'historien, je ne devais être que le
secrétaire. En dressant l'inventaire des vices et des vertus, en
rassemblant les principaux faits des passions, en peignant les
caractères, en choisissant les événements principaux de la Société, en
composant des types par la réunion des traits de plusieurs caractères
homogènes, peut-être pouvais-je arriver à écrire l'histoire oubliée par
tant d'historiens, celle des moeurs. Avec beaucoup de patience et de
courage, je réaliserais, sur la France au dix-neuvième siècle, ce livre
que nous regrettons tous, que Rome, Athènes, Tyr, Memphis, la Perse,
l'Inde ne nous ont malheureusement pas laissé sur leurs civilisations,
et qu'à l'instar de l'abbé Barthélemy, le courageux et patient Monteil
avait essayé pour le Moyen-Age, mais sous une forme peu attrayante.
Ce travail n'était rien encore. S'en tenant à cette reproduction
rigoureuse, un écrivain pouvait devenir un peintre plus ou moins fidèle,
plus ou moins heureux, patient ou courageux des types humains, le
conteur des drames de la vie intime, l'archéologue du mobilier social,
le nomenclateur des professions, l'enregistreur du bien et du mal; mais,
pour mériter les éloges que doit ambitionner tout artiste, ne devais-je
pas étudier les raisons ou la raison de ces effets sociaux, surprendre
le sens caché dans cet immense assemblage de figures, de passions et
d'événements. Enfin, après avoir cherché, je ne dis pas trouvé, cette
raison, ce moteur social, ne fallait-il pas méditer sur les principes
naturels et voir en quoi les Sociétés s'écartent ou se rapprochent de la
règle éternelle, du vrai, du beau? Malgré l'étendue des prémisses, qui
pouvaient être à elles seules un ouvrage, l'oeuvre, pour être entière,
voulait une conclusion. Ainsi dépeinte, la Société devait porter avec
elle la raison de son mouvement.
La loi de l'écrivain, ce qui le fait tel, ce qui, je ne crains pas de le
dire, le rend égal et peut-être supérieur à l'homme d'état, est une
décision quelconque sur les choses humaines, un dévouement absolu à des
principes. Machiavel, Hobbes, Bossuet, Leibnitz, Kant, Montesquieu sont
la science que les hommes d'état appliquent. «Un écrivain doit avoir en
morale et en politique des opinions arrêtées, il doit se regarder comme
un instituteur des hommes; car les hommes n'ont pas besoin de maîtres
pour douter,» a dit Bonald. J'ai pris de bonne heure pour règle ces
grandes paroles, qui sont la loi de l'écrivain monarchique aussi bien
que celle de l'écrivain démocratique. Aussi, quand on voudra m'opposer à
moi-même, se trouvera-t-il qu'on aura mal interprété quelque ironie, ou
bien l'on retorquera mal à propos contre moi le discours d'un de mes
personnages, manoeuvre particulière aux calomniateurs. Quant au sens
intime, à l'âme de cet ouvrage, voici les principes qui lui servent de
base.
L'homme n'est ni bon ni méchant, il naît avec des instincts et des
aptitudes; la Société, loin de le dépraver, comme l'a prétendu Rousseau,
le perfectionne, le rend meilleur; mais l'intérêt développe aussi ses
penchants mauvais. Le christianisme, et surtout le catholicisme, étant,
comme je l'ai dit dans le Médecin de Campagne, un système complet de
répression des tendances dépravées de l'homme, est le plus grand élément
d'Ordre Social.
En lisant attentivement le tableau de la Société, moulée, pour ainsi
dire, sur le vif avec tout son bien et tout son mal, il en résulte cet
enseignement que si la pensée, ou la passion, qui comprend la pensée et
le sentiment, est l'élément social, elle en est aussi l'élément
destructeur. En ceci, la vie sociale ressemble à la vie humaine. On ne
donne aux peuples de longévité qu'en modérant leur action vitale.
L'enseignement, ou mieux, l'éducation par des Corps Religieux est donc
le grand principe d'existence pour les peuples, le seul moyen de
diminuer la somme du mal et d'augmenter la somme du bien dans toute
Société. La pensée, principe des maux et des biens, ne peut être
préparée, domptée, dirigée que par la religion. L'unique religion
possible est le christianisme (voir la lettre écrite de Paris dans LOUIS
LAMBERT[2], où le jeune philosophe mystique explique, à propos de la
doctrine de Swedenborg, comment il n'y a jamais eu qu'une religion
depuis l'origine du monde). Le Christianisme a créé les peuples
modernes, il les conservera. De là sans doute la nécessité du principe
monarchique. Le Catholicisme et la Royauté sont deux principes jumeaux.
Quant aux limites dans lesquelles ces deux principes doivent être
enfermés par des Institutions afin de ne pas les laisser se développer
absolument, chacun sentira qu'une préface aussi succincte que doit
l'être celle-ci, ne saurait devenir un traité politique. Aussi ne
dois-je entrer ni dans les dissensions religieuses ni dans les
dissensions politiques du moment. J'écris à la lueur de deux Vérités
éternelles: la Religion, la Monarchie, deux nécessités que les
événements contemporains proclament, et vers lesquelles tout écrivain de
bon sens doit essayer de ramener notre pays. Sans être l'ennemi de
l'Élection, principe excellent pour constituer la loi, je repousse
l'Élection _prise comme unique moyen social_, et surtout aussi mal
organisée qu'elle l'est aujourd'hui, car elle ne représente pas
d'imposantes minorités aux idées, aux intérêts desquelles songerait un
gouvernement monarchique. L'Élection, étendue à tout, nous donne le
gouvernement par les masses, le seul qui ne soit point responsable, et
où la tyrannie est sans bornes, car elle s'appelle _la loi_. Aussi
regardé-je la Famille et non l'Individu comme le véritable élément
social. Sous ce rapport, au risque d'être regardé comme un esprit
rétrograde, je me range du côté de Bossuet et de Bonald, au lieu d'aller
avec les novateurs modernes. Comme l'Élection est devenue l'unique moyen
social, si j'y avais recours pour moi-même, il ne faudrait pas inférer
la moindre contradiction entre mes actes et ma pensée. Un ingénieur
annonce que tel pont est près de crouler, qu'il y a danger pour tous à
s'en servir, et il y passe lui-même quand ce pont est la seule route
pour arriver à la ville. Napoléon avait merveilleusement adapté
l'Élection au génie de notre pays. Aussi les moindres députés de son
Corps Législatif ont-ils été les plus célèbres orateurs des Chambres
sous la Restauration. Aucune Chambre n'a valu le Corps Législatif en les
comparant homme à homme. Le système électif de l'Empire est donc
incontestablement le meilleur.
  [2] Édition de la _Bibliothèque Charpentier_.
Certaines personnes pourront trouver quelque chose de superbe et
d'avantageux dans cette déclaration. On cherchera querelle au romancier
de ce qu'il veut être historien, on lui demandera raison de sa
politique. J'obéis ici à une obligation, voilà toute la réponse.
L'ouvrage que j'ai entrepris aura la longueur d'une histoire, j'en
devais la raison, encore cachée, les principes et la morale.
Nécessairement forcé de supprimer les préfaces publiées pour répondre à
des critiques essentiellement passagères, je n'en veux conserver qu'une
observation.
Les écrivains qui ont un but, fût-ce un retour aux principes qui se
trouvent dans le passé par cela même qu'ils sont éternels, doivent
toujours déblayer le terrain. Or, quiconque apporte sa pierre dans le
domaine des idées, quiconque signale un abus, quiconque marque d'un
signe le mauvais pour être retranché, celui-là passe toujours pour être
immoral. Le reproche d'immoralité, qui n'a jamais failli à l'écrivain
courageux, est d'ailleurs le dernier qui reste à faire quand on n'a plus
rien à dire à un poëte. Si vous êtes vrai dans vos peintures; si, à
force de travaux diurnes et nocturnes, vous parvenez à écrire la langue
la plus difficile du monde, on vous jette alors le mot immoral à la
face. Socrate fut immoral, Jésus-Christ fut immoral; tous deux ils
furent poursuivis au nom des Sociétés qu'ils renversaient ou
réformaient. Quand on veut tuer quelqu'un, on le taxe d'immoralité.
Cette manoeuvre, familière aux partis, est la honte de tous ceux qui
l'emploient. Luther et Calvin savaient bien ce qu'ils faisaient en se
servant des intérêts matériels blessés comme d'un bouclier! Aussi
ont-ils vécu toute leur vie.
En copiant toute la Société, la saisissant dans l'immensité de ses
agitations, il arrive, il devait arriver que telle composition offrait
plus de mal que de bien, que telle partie de la fresque représentait un
groupe coupable, et la critique de crier à l'immoralité, sans faire
observer la moralité de telle autre partie destinée à former un
contraste parfait. Comme la critique ignorait le plan général, je lui
pardonnais d'autant mieux qu'on ne peut pas plus empêcher la critique
qu'on ne peut empêcher la vue, le langage et le jugement de s'exercer.
Puis le temps de l'impartialité n'est pas encore venu pour moi.
D'ailleurs, l'auteur qui ne sait pas se résoudre à essuyer le feu de la
critique ne doit pas plus se mettre à écrire qu'un voyageur ne doit se
mettre en route en comptant sur un ciel toujours serein. Sur ce point,
il me reste à faire observer que les moralistes les plus consciencieux
doutent fort que la Société puisse offrir autant de bonnes que de
mauvaises actions, et dans le tableau que j'en fais, il se trouve plus
de personnages vertueux que de personnages répréhensibles. Les actions
blâmables, les fautes, les crimes, depuis les plus légers jusqu'aux plus
graves, y trouvent toujours leur punition humaine ou divine, éclatante
ou secrète. J'ai mieux fait que l'historien, je suis plus libre.
Cromwell fut ici-bas, sans autre châtiment que celui que lui infligeait
le penseur. Encore y a-t-il eu discussion d'école à école. Bossuet
lui-même a ménagé ce grand régicide. Guillaume d'Orange l'usurpateur,
Hugues Capet, cet autre usurpateur, meurent pleins de jours, sans avoir
eu plus de défiances ni plus de craintes qu'Henri IV et que Charles
Ier. La vie de Catherine II et celle de Louis XIV, mises en regard,
concluraient contre toute espèce de morale, à les juger au point de vue
de la morale qui régit les particuliers; car pour les Rois, pour les
Hommes d'Etat, il y a, comme l'a dit Napoléon, une petite et une grande
morale. Les _Scènes de la vie politique_ sont basées sur cette belle
réflexion. L'histoire n'a pas pour loi, comme le roman, de tendre vers
le beau idéal. L'histoire est ou devrait être ce qu'elle fut; tandis que
_le roman doit être le monde meilleur_, a dit madame Necker, un des
esprits les plus distingués du dernier siècle. Mais le roman ne serait
rien si, dans cet auguste mensonge, il n'était pas vrai dans les
détails. Obligé de se conformer aux idées d'un pays essentiellement
hypocrite, Walter Scott a été faux, relativement à l'humanité, dans la
peinture de la femme, parce que ses modèles étaient des schismatiques.
La femme protestante n'a pas d'idéal. Elle peut être chaste, pure,
vertueuse; mais son amour sans expansion sera toujours calme et rangé
comme un devoir accompli. Il semblerait que la Vierge Marie ait refroidi
le coeur des sophistes qui la bannissaient du ciel, elle et ses trésors
de miséricorde. Dans le protestantisme, il n'y a plus rien de possible
pour la femme après la faute; tandis que dans l'Eglise catholique,
l'espoir du pardon la rend sublime. Aussi n'existe-t-il qu'une seule
femme pour l'écrivain protestant, tandis que l'écrivain catholique
trouve une femme nouvelle, dans chaque nouvelle situation. Si Walter
Scott eût été catholique, s'il se fût donné pour tâche la description
vraie des différentes Sociétés qui se sont succédé en Ecosse, peut-être
le peintre d'Effie et d'Alice (les deux figures qu'il se reprocha dans
ses vieux jours d'avoir dessinées) eût-il admis les passions avec leurs
fautes et leurs châtiments, avec les vertus que le repentir leur
indique. La passion est toute l'humanité. Sans elle, la religion,
l'histoire, le roman, l'art seraient inutiles.
En me voyant amasser tant de faits et les peindre comme ils sont, avec
la passion pour élément, quelques personnes ont imaginé, bien à tort,
que j'appartenais à l'école sensualiste et matérialiste, deux faces du
même fait, le panthéisme. Mais peut-être pouvait-on, devait-on s'y
tromper. Je ne partage point la croyance à un progrès indéfini, quant
aux Sociétés; je crois aux progrès de l'homme sur lui-même. Ceux qui
veulent apercevoir chez moi une intention de considérer l'homme comme
créature finie se trompent donc étrangement. SÉRAPHITA, la doctrine en
action du Bouddha chrétien, me semble une réponse suffisante à cette
accusation assez légère, avancée ailleurs.
Dans certains fragments de ce long ouvrage, j'ai tenté de populariser
les faits étonnants, je puis dire les prodiges de l'électricité qui se
métamorphose chez l'homme en une puissance incalculée; mais en quoi les
phénomènes cérébraux et nerveux qui démontrent l'existence d'un nouveau
monde moral dérangent-ils les rapports certains et nécessaires entre les
mondes et Dieu? en quoi les dogmes catholiques en seraient-ils ébranlés?
Si, par des faits incontestables, la pensée est rangée un jour parmi les
fluides qui ne se révèlent que par leurs effets et dont la substance
échappe à nos sens même agrandis par tant de moyens mécaniques, il en
sera de ceci comme de la sphéricité de la terre observée par Christophe
Colomb, comme de sa rotation démontrée par Galilée. Notre avenir restera
le même. Le magnétisme animal, aux miracles duquel je me suis
familiarisé depuis 1820; les belles recherches de Gall, le continuateur
de Lavater; tous ceux qui, depuis cinquante ans, ont travaillé la pensée
comme les opticiens ont travaillé la lumière, deux choses quasi
semblables, concluent et pour les mystiques, ces disciples de l'apôtre
saint Jean, et pour tous les grands penseurs qui ont établi le monde
spirituel, cette sphère où se révèlent les rapports entre l'homme et
Dieu.
En saisissant bien le sens de cette composition, on reconnaîtra que
j'accorde aux faits constants, quotidiens, secrets ou patents, aux actes
de la vie individuelle, à leurs causes et à leurs principes autant
d'importance que jusqu'alors les historiens en ont attaché aux
événements de la vie publique des nations. La bataille inconnue qui se
livre dans une vallée de l'Indre entre _madame de Mortsauf_ et la
passion est peut-être aussi grande que la plus illustre des batailles
connues (LE LYS DANS LA VALLÉE). Dans celle-ci, la gloire d'un
conquérant est en jeu; dans l'autre, il s'agit du ciel. Les infortunes
des _Birotteau_, le prêtre et le parfumeur, sont pour moi celles de
l'humanité. _La Fosseuse_ (MÉDECIN DE CAMPAGNE), et _madame Graslin_
(CURÉ DE VILLAGE) sont presque toute la femme. Nous souffrons tous les
jours ainsi. J'ai eu cent fois à faire ce que Richardson n'a fait qu'une
seule fois. Lovelace a mille formes, car la corruption sociale prend les
couleurs de tous les milieux où elle se développe. Au contraire,
Clarisse, cette belle image de la vertu passionnée, a des lignes d'une
pureté désespérante. Pour créer beaucoup de vierges, il faut être
Raphaël. La littérature est peut-être, sous ce rapport, au-dessous de la
peinture. Aussi peut-il m'être permis de faire remarquer combien il se
trouve de figures irréprochables (comme vertu) dans les portions
publiées de cet ouvrage: Pierrette Lorrain, Ursule Mirouët, Constance
Birotteau, la Fosseuse, Eugénie Grandet, Marguerite Claës, Pauline de
Villenoix, madame Jules, madame de La Chanterie, Ève Chardon,
mademoiselle d'Esgrignon, madame Firmiani, Agathe Rouget, Renée de
Maucombe; enfin bien des figures du second plan, qui pour être moins en
relief que celles-ci, n'en offrent pas moins au lecteur la pratique des
vertus domestiques. Joseph Lebas, Genestas, Benassis, le curé Bonnet, le
médecin Minoret, Pillerault, David Séchard, les deux Birotteau, le curé
Chaperon, le juge Popinot, Bourgeat, les Sauviat, les Tascheron, et bien
d'autres ne résolvent-ils pas le difficile problème littéraire qui
consiste à rendre intéressant un personnage vertueux.
Ce n'était pas une petite tâche que de peindre les deux ou trois mille
figures saillantes d'une époque, car telle est, en définitive, la somme
des types que présente chaque génération et que LA COMÉDIE HUMAINE
comportera. Ce nombre de figures, de caractères, cette multitude
d'existences exigeaient des cadres, et, qu'on me pardonne cette
expression, des galeries. De là, les divisions si naturelles, déjà
connues, de mon ouvrage en _Scènes de la vie privée_, _de province_,
_parisienne_, _politique_, _militaire_ et _de campagne_. Dans ces six
livres sont classées toutes les _Etudes de moeurs_ qui forment
l'histoire générale de la Société, la collection de tous ses faits et
gestes, eussent dit nos ancêtres. Ces six livres répondent d'ailleurs à
des idées générales. Chacun d'eux a son sens, sa signification, et
formule une époque de la vie humaine. Je répéterai là, mais
succinctement, ce qu'écrivit, après s'être enquis de mon plan, Félix
Davin, jeune talent ravi aux lettres par une mort prématurée. Les
_Scènes de la vie privée_ représentent l'enfance, l'adolescence et
leurs fautes, comme les _Scènes de la vie de province_ représentent
l'âge des passions, des calculs, des intérêts et de l'ambition. Puis les
_Scènes de la vie parisienne_ offrent le tableau des goûts, des vices et
de toutes les choses effrénées qu'excitent les moeurs particulières aux
capitales où se rencontrent à la fois l'extrême bien et l'extrême mal.
Chacune de ces trois parties a sa couleur locale: Paris et la province,
cette antithèse sociale a fourni ses immenses ressources. Non-seulement
les hommes, mais encore les événements principaux de la vie, se
formulent par des types. Il y a des situations qui se représentent dans
toutes les existences, des phases typiques, et c'est là l'une des
exactitudes que j'ai le plus cherchées. J'ai tâché de donner une idée
des différentes contrées de notre beau pays. Mon ouvrage a sa géographie
comme il a sa généalogie et ses familles, ses lieux et ses choses, ses
personnes et ses faits; comme il a son armorial, ses nobles et ses
bourgeois, ses artisans et ses paysans, ses politiques et ses dandies,
son armée, tout son monde enfin!
Après avoir peint dans ces trois livres la vie sociale, il restait à
montrer les existences d'exception qui résument les intérêts de
plusieurs ou de tous, qui sont en quelque sorte hors la loi commune: de
là les _Scènes de la vie politique_. Cette vaste peinture de la société
finie et achevée, ne fallait-il pas la montrer dans son état le plus
violent; se portant hors de chez elle, soit pour la défense, soit pour
la conquête? De là les _Scènes de la vie militaire_, la portion la moins
complète encore de mon ouvrage, mais dont la place sera laissée dans
cette édition, afin qu'elle en fasse partie quand je l'aurai terminée.
Enfin, les _Scènes de la vie de campagne_ sont en quelque sorte le soir
de cette longue journée, s'il m'est permis de nommer ainsi le drame
social. Dans ce livre, se trouvent les plus purs caractères et
l'application des grands principes d'ordre, de politique, de moralité.
Telle est l'assise pleine de figures, pleine de comédies et de
tragédies sur laquelle s'élèvent les _Etudes philosophiques_, Seconde
Partie de l'ouvrage, où le moyen social de tous les effets se trouve
démontré, où les ravages de la pensée sont peints, sentiment à
sentiment, et dont le premier ouvrage, LA PEAU DE CHAGRIN, relie en
quelque sorte les _Etudes de moeurs_ aux _Etudes philosophiques_ par
l'anneau d'une fantaisie presque orientale où la Vie elle-même est
peinte aux prises avec le Désir, principe de toute Passion.
Au-dessus, se trouveront les _Etudes analytiques_, desquelles je ne
dirai rien, car il n'en a été publié qu'une seule, LA PHYSIOLOGIE DU
MARIAGE.
D'ici à quelque temps, je dois donner deux autres ouvrages de ce genre.
D'abord la PATHOLOGIE DE LA VIE SOCIALE, puis l'ANATOMIE DES CORPS
ENSEIGNANTS et la MONOGRAPHIE DE LA VERTU.
En voyant tout ce qui reste à faire, peut-être dira-t-on de moi ce
qu'ont dit mes éditeurs: Que Dieu vous prête vie! Je souhaite seulement
de n'être pas aussi tourmenté par les hommes et par les choses que je le
suis depuis que j'ai entrepris cet effroyable labeur. J'ai eu ceci pour
moi, dont je rends grâce à Dieu, que les plus grands talents de cette
époque, que les plus beaux caractères, que de sincères amis, aussi
grands dans la vie privée que ceux-ci le sont dans la vie publique,
m'ont serré la main en me disant:--Courage! Et pourquoi n'avouerais-je
pas que ces amitiés, que des témoignages donnés çà et là par des
inconnus, m'ont soutenu dans la carrière et contre moi-même et contre
d'injustes attaques, contre la calomnie qui m'a si souvent poursuivi,
contre le découragement et contre cette trop vive espérance dont les
paroles sont prises pour celles d'un amour-propre excessif? J'avais
résolu d'opposer une impassibilité stoïque aux attaques et aux injures;
mais, en deux occasions, de lâches calomnies ont rendu la défense
nécessaire. Si les partisans du pardon des injures regrettent que j'aie
montré mon savoir en fait d'escrime littéraire, plusieurs chrétiens
pensent que nous vivons dans un temps où il est bon de faire voir que le
silence a sa générosité.
A ce propos, je dois faire observer que je ne reconnais pour mes
ouvrages que ceux qui portent mon nom. En dehors de LA COMÉDIE HUMAINE,
il n'y a de moi que les _Cent contes drôlatiques_, deux pièces de
théâtre et des articles isolés qui d'ailleurs sont signés. J'use ici
d'un droit incontestable. Mais ce désaveu, quand même il atteindrait des
ouvrages auxquels j'aurais collaboré, m'est commandé moins par
l'amour-propre que par la vérité. Si l'on persistait à m'attribuer des
livres que, littérairement parlant, je ne reconnais point pour miens,
mais dont la propriété me fut confiée, je laisserais dire, par la même
raison que je laisse le champ libre aux calomnies.
L'immensité d'un plan qui embrasse à la fois l'histoire et la critique
de la Société, l'analyse de ses maux et la discussion de ses principes,
m'autorise, je crois, à donner à mon ouvrage le titre sous lequel il
paraît aujourd'hui: _La Comédie humaine_. Est-ce ambitieux? N'est-ce que
juste? C'est ce que, l'ouvrage terminé, le public décidera.

PREMIER LIVRE,
SCÈNES DE LA VIE PRIVÉE.
LA MAISON DU CHAT-QUI-PELOTE.
  DÉDIÉ A MADEMOISELLE MARIE DE MONTHEAU.
Au milieu de la rue Saint-Denis, presque au coin de la rue du
Petit-Lion, existait naguère une de ces maisons précieuses qui donnent
aux historiens la facilité de reconstruire par analogie l'ancien Paris.
Les murs menaçants de cette bicoque semblaient avoir été bariolés
d'hiéroglyphes. Quel autre nom le flâneur pouvait-il donner aux X et aux
V que traçaient sur la façade les pièces de bois transversales ou
diagonales dessinées dans le badigeon par de petites lézardes
parallèles? Évidemment, au passage de toutes les voitures, chacune de
ces solives s'agitait dans sa mortaise. Ce vénérable édifice était
surmonté d'un toit triangulaire dont aucun modèle ne se verra bientôt
plus à Paris. Cette couverture, tordue par les intempéries du climat
parisien, s'avançait de trois pieds sur la rue, autant pour garantir des
eaux pluviales le seuil de la porte, que pour abriter le mur d'un
grenier et sa lucarne sans appui. Ce dernier étage était construit en
planches clouées l'une sur l'autre comme des ardoises, afin sans doute
de ne pas charger cette frêle maison.
Par une matinée pluvieuse, au mois de mars, un jeune homme,
soigneusement enveloppé dans son manteau, se tenait sous l'auvent de la
boutique qui se trouvait en face de ce vieux logis, et paraissait
l'examiner avec un enthousiasme d'archéologue. A la vérité, ce débris
de la bourgeoisie du seizième siècle pouvait offrir à l'observateur plus
d'un problème à résoudre. Chaque étage avait sa singularité. Au premier,
quatre fenêtres longues, étroites, rapprochées l'une de l'autre, avaient
des carreaux de bois dans leur partie inférieure, afin de produire ce
jour douteux, à la faveur duquel un habile marchand prête aux étoffes la
couleur souhaitée par ses chalands. Le jeune homme semblait plein de
dédain pour cette partie essentielle de la maison, ses yeux ne s'y
étaient pas encore arrêtés. Les fenêtres du second étage, dont les
jalousies relevées laissaient voir, au travers de grands carreaux en
verre de Bohême, de petits rideaux de mousseline rousse, ne
l'intéressaient pas davantage. Son attention se portait particulièrement
au troisième, sur d'humbles croisées dont le bois travaillé
grossièrement aurait mérité d'être placé au Conservatoire des arts et
métiers pour y indiquer les premiers efforts de la menuiserie française.
Ces croisées avaient de petites vitres d'une couleur si verte, que, sans
son excellente vue, le jeune homme n'aurait pu apercevoir les rideaux de
toile à carreaux bleus qui cachaient les mystères de cet appartement aux
yeux des profanes. Parfois, cet observateur, ennuyé de sa contemplation
sans résultat, ou du silence dans lequel la maison était ensevelie,
ainsi que tout le quartier, abaissait ses regards vers les régions
inférieures. Un sourire involontaire se dessinait alors sur ses lèvres,
quand il revoyait la boutique où se rencontraient en effet des choses
assez risibles. Une formidable pièce de bois, horizontalement appuyée
sur quatre piliers qui paraissaient courbés par le poids de cette maison
décrépite, avait été rechampie d'autant de couches de diverses peintures
que la joue d'une vieille duchesse en a reçu de rouge. Au milieu de
cette large poutre mignardement sculptée se trouvait un antique tableau
représentant un chat qui pelotait. Cette toile causait la gaieté du
jeune homme. Mais il faut dire que le plus spirituel des peintres
modernes n'inventerait pas de charge si comique. L'animal tenait dans
une de ses pattes de devant une raquette aussi grande que lui, et se
dressait sur ses pattes de derrière pour mirer une énorme balle que lui
renvoyait un gentilhomme en habit brodé. Dessin, couleurs, accessoires,
tout était traité de manière à faire croire que l'artiste avait voulu se
moquer du marchand et des passants. En altérant cette peinture naïve, le
temps l'avait rendue encore plus grotesque par quelques incertitudes qui
devaient inquiéter de consciencieux flâneurs. Ainsi la queue mouchetée
du chat était découpée de telle sorte qu'on pouvait la prendre pour un
spectateur, tant la queue des chats de nos ancêtres était grosse, haute
et fournie. A droite du tableau, sur un champ d'azur qui déguisait
imparfaitement la pourriture du bois, les passants lisaient GUILLAUME;
et à gauche, SUCCESSEUR DU SIEUR CHEVREL. Le soleil et la pluie avaient
rongé la plus grande partie de l'or moulu parcimonieusement appliqué sur
les lettres de cette inscription, dans laquelle les U remplaçaient les
V, et réciproquement, selon les lois de notre ancienne orthographe. Afin
de rabattre l'orgueil de ceux qui croient que le monde devient de jour
en jour plus spirituel, et que le moderne charlatanisme surpasse tout,
il convient de faire observer ici que ces enseignes, dont l'étymologie
semble bizarre à plus d'un négociant parisien, sont les tableaux morts
de vivants tableaux à l'aide desquels nos espiègles ancêtres avaient
réussi à amener les chalands dans leurs maisons. Ainsi la
Truie-qui-file, le Singe-vert, etc., furent des animaux en cage dont
l'adresse émerveillait les passants, et dont l'éducation prouvait la
patience de l'industriel au quinzième siècle. De semblables curiosités
enrichissaient plus vite leurs heureux possesseurs que les Providence,
les Bonne-foi, les Grâce-de-Dieu et les Décollation de saint
Jean-Baptiste qui se voient encore rue Saint-Denis. Cependant l'inconnu
ne restait certes pas là pour admirer ce chat, qu'un moment d'attention
suffisait à graver dans la mémoire. Ce jeune homme avait aussi ses
singularités. Son manteau, plissé dans le goût des draperies antiques,
laissait voir une élégante chaussure, d'autant plus remarquable au
milieu de la boue parisienne, qu'il portait des bas de soie blancs dont
les mouchetures attestaient son impatience. Il sortait sans doute d'une
noce ou d'un bal; car à cette heure matinale il tenait à la main des
gants blancs; et les boucles de ses cheveux noirs défrisés, éparpillées
sur ses épaules, indiquaient une coiffure à la Caracalla, mise à la mode
autant par l'école de David que par cet engouement pour les formes
grecques et romaines qui marqua les premières années de ce siècle.
Malgré le bruit que faisaient quelques maraîchers attardés passant au
galop pour se rendre à la grande halle, cette rue si agitée avait alors
un calme dont la magie n'est connue que de ceux qui ont erré dans Paris
désert, à ces heures où son tapage, un moment apaisé, renaît et s'entend
dans le lointain comme la grande voix de la mer. Cet étrange jeune homme
devait être aussi curieux pour les commerçants du Chat-qui-pelote, que
le Chat-qui-pelote l'était pour lui. Une cravate éblouissante de
blancheur rendait sa figure tourmentée encore plus pâle qu'elle ne
l'était réellement. Le feu tour à tour sombre et pétillant que jetaient
ses yeux noirs s'harmoniait avec les contours bizarres de son visage,
avec sa bouche large et sinueuse qui se contractait en souriant. Son
front, ridé par une contrariété violente, avait quelque chose de fatal.
Le front n'est-il pas ce qui se trouve de plus prophétique en l'homme?
Quand celui de l'inconnu exprimait la passion, les plis qui s'y
formaient causaient une sorte d'effroi par la vigueur avec laquelle ils
se prononçaient; mais lorsqu'il reprenait son calme, si facile à
troubler, il y respirait une grâce lumineuse qui rendait attrayante
cette physionomie où la joie, la douleur, l'amour, la colère, le dédain
éclataient d'une manière si communicative que l'homme le plus froid en
devait être impressionné. Cet inconnu se dépitait si bien au moment où
l'on ouvrit précipitamment la lucarne du grenier, qu'il n'y vit pas
apparaître trois joyeuses figures rondelettes, blanches, roses, mais
aussi communes que le sont les figures du Commerce sculptées sur
certains monuments. Ces trois faces, encadrées par la lucarne,
rappelaient les têtes d'anges bouffis semés dans les nuages qui
accompagnent le Père éternel. Les apprentis respirèrent les émanations
de la rue avec une avidité qui démontrait combien l'atmosphère de leur
grenier était chaude et méphitique. Après avoir indiqué ce singulier
factionnaire, le commis qui paraissait être le plus jovial disparut et
revint en tenant à la main un instrument dont le métal inflexible a été
récemment remplacé par un cuir souple; puis tous prirent une expression
malicieuse en regardant le badaud qu'ils aspergèrent d'une pluie fine et
blanchâtre dont le parfum prouvait que les trois mentons venaient d'être
rasés. Élevés sur la pointe de leurs pieds et réfugiés au fond de leur
grenier pour jouir de la colère de leur victime, les commis cessèrent de
rire en voyant l'insouciant dédain avec lequel le jeune homme secoua son
manteau, et le profond mépris que peignit sa figure quand il leva les
yeux sur la lucarne vide. En ce moment, une main blanche et délicate fit
remonter vers l'imposte la partie inférieure d'une des grossières
croisées du troisième étage, au moyen de ces coulisses dont le
tourniquet laisse souvent tomber à l'improviste le lourd vitrage qu'il
doit retenir. Le passant fut alors récompensé de sa longue attente. La
figure d'une jeune fille, fraîche comme un de ces blancs calices qui
fleurissent au sein des eaux, se montra couronnée d'une ruche en
mousseline froissée qui donnait à sa tête un air d'innocence admirable.
Quoique couverts d'une étoffe brune, son cou, ses épaules
s'apercevaient, grâce à de légers interstices ménagés par les mouvements
du sommeil. Aucune expression de contrainte n'altérait ni l'ingénuité de
ce visage, ni le calme de ces yeux immortalisés par avance dans les
sublimes compositions de Raphaël: c'était la même grâce, la même
tranquillité de ces vierges devenues proverbiales. Il existait un
charmant contraste produit par la jeunesse des joues de cette figure,
sur laquelle le sommeil avait comme mis en relief une surabondance de
vie, et par la vieillesse de cette fenêtre massive aux contours
grossiers, dont l'appui était noir. Semblable à ces fleurs de jour qui
n'ont pas encore au matin déplié leur tunique roulée par le froid des
nuits, la jeune fille, à peine éveillée, laissa errer ses yeux bleus sur
les toits voisins et regarda le ciel; puis, par une sorte d'habitude,
elle les baissa sur les sombres régions de la rue, où ils rencontrèrent
aussitôt ceux de son adorateur. La coquetterie la fit sans doute
souffrir d'être vue en déshabillé, elle se retira vivement en arrière,
le tourniquet tout usé tourna, la croisée redescendit avec cette
rapidité qui, de nos jours, a valu un nom odieux à cette naïve invention
de nos ancêtres, et la vision disparut. Il semblait à ce jeune homme que
la plus brillante des étoiles du matin avait été soudain cachée par un
nuage.
Pendant ces petits événements, les lourds volets intérieurs qui
défendaient le léger vitrage de la boutique du Chat-qui-pelote avaient
été enlevés comme par magie. La vieille porte à heurtoir fut repliée sur
le mur intérieur de la maison par un serviteur vraisemblablement
contemporain de l'enseigne, qui d'une main tremblante y attacha le
morceau de drap carré sur lequel était brodé en soie jaune le nom de
_Guillaume, successeur de Chevrel_. Il eût été difficile à plus d'un
passant de deviner le genre de commerce de monsieur Guillaume. A travers
les gros barreaux de fer qui protégeaient extérieurement sa boutique, à
peine y apercevait-on des paquets enveloppés de toile brune aussi
nombreux que des harengs quand ils traversent l'Océan. Malgré
l'apparente simplicité de cette gothique façade, monsieur Guillaume
était, de tous les marchands drapiers de Paris, celui dont les magasins
se trouvaient toujours le mieux fournis, dont les relations avaient le
plus d'étendue, et dont la probité commerciale était la plus exacte. Si
quelques-uns de ses confrères avaient conclu des marchés avec le
gouvernement, sans avoir la quantité de drap voulue, il était toujours
prêt à la leur livrer, quelque considérable que fût le nombre de pièces
soumissionnées. Le rusé négociant connaissait mille manières de
s'attribuer le plus fort bénéfice sans se trouver obligé, comme eux, de
courir chez des protecteurs, y faire des bassesses ou de riches
présents. Si les confrères ne pouvaient le payer qu'en excellentes
traites un peu longues, il indiquait son notaire comme un homme
accommodant, et savait encore tirer une seconde mouture du sac, grâce à
cet expédient qui faisait dire proverbialement aux négociants de la rue
Saint-Denis:--Dieu vous garde du notaire de monsieur Guillaume! pour
désigner un escompte onéreux. Le vieux négociant se trouva debout comme
par miracle, sur le seuil de sa boutique, au moment où le domestique se
retira. Monsieur Guillaume regarda la rue Saint-Denis, les boutiques
voisines et le temps, comme un homme qui débarque au Havre et revoit la
France après un long voyage. Bien convaincu que rien n'avait changé
pendant son sommeil, il aperçut alors le passant en faction, qui, de son
côté, contemplait le patriarche de la draperie, comme Humboldt dut
examiner le premier gymnote électrique qu'il vit en Amérique. Monsieur
Guillaume portait de larges culottes de velours noir, des bas chinés et
des souliers carrés à boucles d'argent. Son habit à pans carrés, à
basques carrées, à collet carré, enveloppait son corps, légèrement
voûté, d'un drap verdâtre garni de grands boutons en métal blanc mais
rougis par l'usage. Ses cheveux gris étaient si exactement aplatis et
peignés sur son crâne jaune, qu'ils le faisaient ressembler à un champ
sillonné. Ses petits yeux verts, percés comme avec une vrille,
flamboyaient sous deux arcs marqués d'une faible rougeur à défaut de
sourcils. Les inquiétudes avaient tracé sur son front des rides
horizontales aussi nombreuses que les plis de son habit. Cette figure
blême annonçait la patience, la sagesse commerciale, et l'espèce de
cupidité rusée que réclament les affaires. A cette époque on voyait
moins rarement qu'aujourd'hui de ces vieilles familles où se
conservaient, comme de précieuses traditions, les moeurs, les costumes
caractéristiques de leurs professions, et restées au milieu de la
civilisation nouvelle comme ces débris antédiluviens retrouvés par
Cuvier dans les carrières. Le chef de la famille Guillaume était un de
ces notables gardiens des anciens usages: on le surprenait à regretter
le Prévôt des Marchands, et jamais il ne parlait d'un jugement du
tribunal de commerce sans le nommer la _sentence des consuls_. C'était
sans doute en vertu de ces coutumes que, levé le premier de sa maison,
il attendait de pied ferme l'arrivée de ses trois commis, pour les
gourmander en cas de retard. Ces jeunes disciples de Mercure ne
connaissaient rien de plus redoutable que l'activité silencieuse avec
laquelle le patron scrutait leurs visages et leurs mouvements, le lundi
matin, en y recherchant les preuves ou les traces de leurs escapades.
Mais, en ce moment, le vieux drapier ne fit aucune attention à ses
apprentis. Il était occupé à chercher le motif de la sollicitude avec
laquelle le jeune homme en bas de soie et en manteau portait
alternativement les yeux sur son enseigne et sur les profondeurs de son
magasin. Le jour, devenu plus éclatant, permettait d'y apercevoir le
bureau grillagé, entouré de rideaux en vieille soie verte, où se
tenaient les livres immenses, oracles muets de la maison. Le trop
curieux étranger semblait convoiter ce petit local, y prendre le plan
d'une salle à manger latérale, éclairée par un vitrage pratiqué dans le
plafond, et d'où la famille réunie devait facilement voir, pendant ses
repas, les plus légers accidents qui pouvaient arriver sur le seuil de
la boutique. Un si grand amour pour son logis paraissait suspect à un
négociant qui avait subi le régime de la Terreur. Monsieur Guillaume
pensait donc assez naturellement que cette figure sinistre en voulait à
la caisse du Chat-qui-pelote. Après avoir discrètement joui du duel muet
qui avait lieu entre son patron et l'inconnu, le plus âgé des commis
hasarda de se placer sur la dalle où était monsieur Guillaume, en voyant
le jeune homme contempler à la dérobée les croisées du troisième. Il fit
deux pas dans la rue, leva la tête, et crut avoir aperçu mademoiselle
Augustine Guillaume qui se retirait avec précipitation. Mécontent de la
perspicacité de son premier commis, le drapier lui lança un regard de
travers; mais tout à coup les craintes mutuelles que la présence de ce
passant excitait dans l'âme du marchand et de l'amoureux commis se
calmèrent. L'inconnu héla un fiacre qui se rendait à une place voisine,
et y monta rapidement en affectant une trompeuse indifférence. Ce départ
mit un certain baume dans le coeur des autres commis, assez inquiets de
retrouver la victime de leur plaisanterie.
--Hé bien, messieurs, qu'avez-vous donc à rester là, les bras croisés?
dit monsieur Guillaume à ses trois néophytes. Mais autrefois, sarpejeu!
quand j'étais chez le sieur Chevrel, j'avais déjà visité plus de deux
pièces de drap.
--Il faisait donc jour de meilleure heure, dit le second commis que
cette tâche concernait.
Le vieux négociant ne put s'empêcher de sourire. Quoique deux de ces
trois jeunes gens, confiés à ses soins par leurs pères, riches
manufacturiers de Louviers et Sedan, n'eussent qu'à demander cent mille
francs pour les avoir, le jour où ils seraient en âge de s'établir,
Guillaume croyait de son devoir de les tenir sous la férule d'un antique
despotisme inconnu de nos jours dans les brillants magasins modernes
dont les commis veulent être riches à trente ans: il les faisait
travailler comme des nègres. A eux trois, ces commis suffisaient à une
besogne qui aurait mis sur les dents dix de ces employés dont le
sybaritisme enfle aujourd'hui les colonnes du budget. Aucun bruit ne
troublait la paix de cette maison solennelle, où les gonds semblaient
toujours huilés, et dont le moindre meuble avait cette propreté
respectable qui annonce un ordre et une économie sévères. Souvent, le
plus espiègle des commis s'était amusé à écrire sur le fromage de
Gruyère qu'on leur abandonnait au déjeuner, et qu'ils se plaisaient à
respecter, la date de sa réception primitive. Cette malice et quelques
autres semblables faisaient parfois sourire la plus jeune des deux
filles de Guillaume, la jolie vierge qui venait d'apparaître au passant
enchanté. Quoique chacun des apprentis, et même le plus ancien, payât
une forte pension, aucun d'eux n'eût été assez hardi pour rester à la
table du patron au moment où le dessert y était servi. Lorsque madame
Guillaume parlait d'accommoder la salade, ces pauvres jeunes gens
tremblaient en songeant avec quelle parcimonie sa prudente main savait y
épancher l'huile. Il ne fallait pas qu'ils s'avisassent de passer une
nuit dehors, sans avoir donné longtemps à l'avance un motif plausible à
cette irrégularité. Chaque dimanche, et à tour de rôle, deux commis
accompagnaient la famille Guillaume à la messe de Saint-Leu et aux
vêpres. Mesdemoiselles Virginie et Augustine, modestement vêtues
d'indienne, prenaient chacune le bras d'un commis et marchaient en
avant, sous les yeux perçants de leur mère, qui fermait ce petit cortége
domestique avec son mari accoutumé par elle à porter deux gros
paroissiens reliés en maroquin noir. Le second commis n'avait pas
d'appointements. Quant à celui que douze ans de persévérance et de
discrétion initiaient aux secrets de la maison, il recevait huit cents
francs en récompense de ses labeurs. A certaines fêtes de famille, il
était gratifié de quelques cadeaux auxquels la main sèche et ridée de
madame Guillaume donnait seule du prix: des bourses en filet, qu'elle
avait soin d'emplir de coton pour faire valoir leurs dessins à jour; des
bretelles fortement conditionnées, ou des paires de bas de soie bien
lourdes. Quelquefois, mais rarement, ce premier ministre était admis à
partager les plaisirs de la famille soit quand elle allait à la
campagne, soit quand après des mois d'attente elle se décidait à user de
son droit à demander, en louant une loge, une pièce à laquelle Paris ne
pensait plus. Quant aux deux autres commis, la barrière de respect qui
séparait jadis un maître drapier de ses apprentis était placée si
fortement entre eux et le vieux négociant, qu'il leur eût été plus
facile de voler une pièce de drap que de déranger cette auguste
étiquette. Cette réserve peut paraître ridicule aujourd'hui. Néanmoins,
ces vieilles maisons étaient des écoles de moeurs et de probité. Les
maîtres adoptaient leurs apprentis. Le linge d'un jeune homme était
soigné, réparé, quelquefois renouvelé par la maîtresse de la maison. Un
commis tombait-il malade, il devenait l'objet de soins vraiment
maternels. En cas de danger, le patron prodiguait son argent pour
appeler les plus célèbres docteurs; car il ne répondait pas seulement
des moeurs et du savoir de ces jeunes gens à leurs parents. Si l'un
d'eux, honorable par le caractère, éprouvait quelque désastre, ces vieux
négociants savaient apprécier l'intelligence qu'ils avaient développée,
et n'hésitaient pas à confier le bonheur de leurs filles à celui auquel
ils avaient pendant longtemps confié leurs fortunes. Guillaume était un
de ces hommes antiques; et s'il en avait les ridicules, il en avait
toutes les qualités. Aussi Joseph Lebas, son premier commis, orphelin et
sans fortune, était-il, dans son idée, le futur époux de Virginie sa
fille aînée. Mais Joseph ne partageait point les pensées symétriques de
son patron, qui, pour un empire, n'aurait pas marié sa seconde fille
avant la première. L'infortuné commis se sentait le coeur entièrement
pris pour mademoiselle Augustine la cadette. Afin de justifier cette
passion qui avait grandi secrètement, il est nécessaire de pénétrer plus
avant dans les ressorts du gouvernement absolu qui régissait la maison
du vieux marchand drapier.
Guillaume avait deux filles. L'aînée, mademoiselle Virginie, était tout
le portrait de sa mère. Madame Guillaume, fille du sieur Chevrel, se
tenait si droite sur la banquette de son comptoir, que plus d'une fois
elle avait entendu des plaisants parier qu'elle y était empalée. Sa
figure maigre et longue trahissait une dévotion outrée. Sans grâces et
sans manières aimables, madame Guillaume ornait habituellement sa tête
presque sexagénaire d'un bonnet dont la forme était invariable et garni
de barbes comme celui d'une veuve. Tout le voisinage l'appelait la soeur
tourière. Sa parole était brève, et ses gestes avaient quelque chose des
mouvements saccadés d'un télégraphe. Son oeil, clair comme celui d'un
chat, semblait en vouloir à tout le monde de ce qu'elle était laide.
Mademoiselle Virginie, élevée comme sa jeune soeur sous les lois
despotiques de leur mère, avait atteint l'âge de vingt-huit ans. La
jeunesse atténuait l'air disgracieux que sa ressemblance avec sa mère
donnait parfois à sa figure; mais la rigueur maternelle l'avait dotée de
deux grandes qualités qui pouvaient tout contre-balancer: elle était
douce et patiente. Mademoiselle Augustine, à peine âgée de dix-huit ans,
ne ressemblait ni à son père ni à sa mère. Elle était de ces filles qui,
par l'absence de tout lien physique avec leurs parents, font croire à ce
dicton de prude: Dieu donne les enfants. Augustine était petite, ou,
pour la mieux peindre, mignonne. Gracieuse et pleine de candeur, un
homme du monde n'aurait pu reprocher à cette charmante créature que des
gestes mesquins ou certaines attitudes communes, et parfois de la gêne.
Sa figure silencieuse et immobile respirait cette mélancolie passagère
qui s'empare de toutes les jeunes filles trop faibles pour oser résister
aux volontés d'une mère. Toujours modestement vêtues, les deux soeurs ne
pouvaient satisfaire la coquetterie innée chez la femme que par un luxe
de propreté qui leur allait à merveille et les mettait en harmonie avec
ces comptoirs luisants, avec ces rayons sur lesquels le vieux domestique
ne souffrait pas un grain de poussière, avec la simplicité antique de
tout ce qui se voyait autour d'elles. Obligées par leur genre de vie à
chercher des éléments de bonheur dans des travaux obstinés, Augustine et
Virginie n'avaient donné jusqu'alors que du contentement à leur mère,
qui s'applaudissait secrètement de la perfection du caractère de ses
deux filles. Il est facile d'imaginer les résultats de l'éducation
qu'elles avaient reçue. Élevées pour le commerce, habituées à n'entendre
que des raisonnements et des calculs tristement mercantiles, n'ayant
étudié que la grammaire, la tenue des livres, un peu d'histoire juive,
l'histoire de France dans Le Ragois, et ne lisant que les auteurs dont
la lecture leur était permise par leur mère, leurs idées n'avaient pas
pris beaucoup d'étendue; elles savaient parfaitement tenir un ménage,
elles connaissaient le prix des choses, elles appréciaient les
difficultés que l'on éprouve à amasser l'argent, elles étaient économes
et portaient un grand respect aux qualités du négociant. Malgré la
fortune de leur père, elles étaient aussi habiles à faire des reprises
qu'à festonner; souvent leur mère parlait de leur apprendre la cuisine
afin qu'elles sussent bien ordonner un dîner, et pussent gronder une
cuisinière en connaissance de cause. Ignorant les plaisirs du monde et
voyant comment s'écoulait la vie exemplaire de leurs parents, elles ne
jetaient que bien rarement leurs regards au delà de l'enceinte de cette
vieille maison patrimoniale qui, pour leur mère, était l'univers. Les
réunions occasionnées par les solennités de famille formaient tout
l'avenir de leurs joies terrestres. Quand le grand salon situé au second
étage devait recevoir madame Roguin, une demoiselle Chevrel, de quinze
ans moins âgée que sa cousine et qui portait des diamants; le jeune
Rabourdin, sous-chef aux Finances; monsieur César Birotteau, riche
parfumeur, et sa femme appelée madame César; monsieur Camusot, le plus
riche négociant en soieries de la rue des Bourdonnais; deux ou trois
vieux banquiers, et des femmes irréprochables; les apprêts nécessités
par la manière dont l'argenterie, les porcelaines de Saxe, les bougies,
les cristaux étaient empaquetés faisaient une diversion à la vie
monotone de ces trois femmes qui allaient et venaient, en se donnant
autant de mouvement que des religieuses pour la réception d'un évêque.
Puis quand, le soir, fatiguées toutes trois d'avoir essuyé, frotté,
déballé, mis en place les ornements de la fête, les deux jeunes filles
aidaient leur mère à se coucher, madame Guillaume leur disait:--Nous
n'avons rien fait aujourd'hui, mes enfants! Lorsque, dans ces assemblées
solennelles, la soeur tourière permettait de danser en confinant les
parties de boston, de wisk et de trictrac dans sa chambre à coucher,
cette concession était comptée parmi les félicités les plus inespérées,
et causait un bonheur égal à celui d'aller à deux ou trois grands bals
où Guillaume menait ses filles à l'époque du carnaval. Enfin, une fois
par an, l'honnête drapier donnait une fête pour laquelle rien n'était
épargné. Quelque riches et élégantes que fussent les personnes invitées,
elles se gardaient bien d'y manquer; car les maisons les plus
considérables de la place avaient recours à l'immense crédit, à la
fortune ou à la vieille expérience de monsieur Guillaume. Mais les deux
filles de ce digne négociant ne profitaient pas autant qu'on pourrait le
supposer des enseignements que le monde offre à de jeunes âmes. Elles
apportaient dans ces réunions, inscrites d'ailleurs sur le carnet
d'échéances de la maison, des parures dont la mesquinerie les faisait
rougir. Leur manière de danser n'avait rien de remarquable, et la
surveillance maternelle ne leur permettait pas de soutenir la
conversation autrement que par Oui et Non avec leurs cavaliers. Puis la
loi de la vieille enseigne du Chat-qui-pelote leur ordonnait d'être
rentrées à onze heures, moment où les bals et les fêtes commencent à
s'animer. Ainsi leurs plaisirs, en apparence assez conformes à la
fortune de leur père, devenaient souvent insipides par des circonstances
qui tenaient aux habitudes et aux principes de cette famille. Quant à
leur vie habituelle, une seule observation achèvera de la peindre.
Madame Guillaume exigeait que ses deux filles fussent habillées de grand
matin, qu'elles descendissent tous les jours à la même heure, et
soumettait leurs occupations à une régularité monastique. Cependant
Augustine avait reçu du hasard une âme assez élevée pour sentir le vide
de cette existence. Parfois ses yeux bleus se relevaient comme pour
interroger les profondeurs de cet escalier sombre et de ces magasins
humides. Après avoir sondé ce silence de cloître, elle semblait écouter
de loin de confuses révélations de cette vie passionnée qui met les
sentiments à un plus haut prix que les choses. En ces moments son visage
se colorait, ses mains inactives laissaient tomber la blanche mousseline
sur le chêne poli du comptoir, et bientôt sa mère lui disait d'une voix
qui restait toujours aigre même dans les tons les plus doux:--Augustine!
à quoi pensez-vous donc, mon bijou? Peut-être _Hippolyte comte de
Douglas_ et le _Comte de Comminges_, deux romans trouvés par Augustine
dans l'armoire d'une cuisinière récemment renvoyée par madame Guillaume,
contribuèrent-ils à développer les idées de cette jeune fille qui les
avait furtivement dévorés pendant les longues nuits de l'hiver
précédent. Les expressions de désir vague, la voix douce, la peau de
jasmin et les yeux bleus d'Augustine avaient donc allumé dans l'âme du
pauvre Lebas un amour aussi violent que respectueux. Par un caprice
facile à comprendre, Augustine ne se sentait aucun goût pour l'orphelin:
peut-être était-ce parce qu'elle ne se savait pas aimée. En revanche,
les longues jambes, les cheveux châtains, les grosses mains et
l'encolure vigoureuse du premier commis avaient trouvé une secrète
admiratrice dans mademoiselle Virginie, qui, malgré ses cinquante mille
écus de dot, n'était demandée en mariage par personne. Rien de plus
naturel que ces deux passions inverses nées dans le silence de ces
comptoirs obscurs comme fleurissent des violettes dans la profondeur
d'un bois. La muette et constante contemplation qui réunissait les yeux
de ces jeunes gens par un besoin violent de distraction au milieu de
travaux obstinés et d'une paix religieuse, devait tôt ou tard exciter
des sentiments d'amour. L'habitude de voir une figure y fait découvrir
insensiblement les qualités de l'âme, et finit par en effacer les
défauts.
--Au train dont y va cet homme, nos filles ne tarderont pas à se mettre
à genoux devant un prétendu! se dit monsieur Guillaume en lisant le
premier décret par lequel Napoléon anticipa sur les classes de
conscrits.
Dès ce jour, désespéré de voir sa fille aînée se faner, le vieux
marchand se souvint d'avoir épousé mademoiselle Chevrel à peu près dans
la situation où se trouvaient Joseph Lebas et Virginie. Quelle belle
affaire que de marier sa fille et d'acquitter une dette sacrée, en
rendant à un orphelin le bienfait qu'il avait reçu jadis de son
prédécesseur dans les mêmes circonstances! Agé de trente-trois ans,
Joseph Lebas pensait aux obstacles que quinze ans de différence
mettaient entre Augustine et lui. Trop perspicace d'ailleurs pour ne pas
deviner les desseins de monsieur Guillaume, il en connaissait assez les
principes inexorables pour savoir que jamais la cadette ne se marierait
avant l'aînée. Le pauvre commis, dont le coeur était aussi excellent que
ses jambes étaient longues et son buste épais, souffrait donc en
silence.
Tel était l'état des choses dans cette petite république, qui, au milieu
de la rue Saint-Denis, ressemblait assez à une succursale de la Trappe.
Mais pour rendre un compte exact des événements extérieurs comme des
sentiments, il est nécessaire de remonter à quelques mois avant la scène
par laquelle commence cette histoire. A la nuit tombante, un jeune homme
passant devant l'obscure boutique du Chat-qui-pelote y était resté un
moment en contemplation à l'aspect d'un tableau qui aurait arrêté tous
les peintres du monde. Le magasin, n'étant pas encore éclairé, formait
un plan noir au fond duquel se voyait la salle à manger du marchand.
Une lampe astrale y répandait ce jour jaune qui donne tant de grâce aux
tableaux de l'école hollandaise. Le linge blanc, l'argenterie, les
cristaux formaient de brillants accessoires qu'embellissaient encore de
vives oppositions entre l'ombre et la lumière. La figure du père de
famille et celle de sa femme, les visages des commis et les formes pures
d'Augustine, à deux pas de laquelle se tenait une grosse fille joufflue,
composaient un groupe si curieux; ces têtes étaient si originales, et
chaque caractère avait une expression si franche; on devinait si bien la
paix, le silence et la modeste vie de cette famille, que, pour un
artiste accoutumé à exprimer la nature, il y avait quelque chose de
désespérant à vouloir rendre cette scène fortuite. Ce passant était un
jeune peintre, qui, sept ans auparavant, avait remporté le grand prix de
peinture. Il revenait de Rome. Son âme nourrie de poésie, ses yeux
rassasiés de Raphaël et de Michel-Ange, avaient soif de la nature vraie,
après une longue habitation du pays pompeux où l'art a jeté partout son
grandiose. Faux ou juste, tel était son sentiment personnel. Abandonné
longtemps à la fougue des passions italiennes, son coeur demandait une
de ces vierges modestes et recueillies que, malheureusement, il n'avait
su trouver qu'en peinture à Rome. De l'enthousiasme imprimé à son âme
exaltée par le tableau naturel qu'il contemplait, il passa naturellement
à une profonde admiration pour la figure principale: Augustine
paraissait pensive et ne mangeait point; par une disposition de la lampe
dont la lumière tombait entièrement sur son visage, son buste semblait
se mouvoir dans un cercle de feu qui détachait plus vivement les
contours de sa tête et l'illuminait d'une manière quasi surnaturelle.
L'artiste la compara involontairement à un ange exilé qui se souvient du
ciel. Une sensation presque inconnue, un amour limpide et bouillonnant
inonda son coeur. Après être demeuré pendant un moment comme écrasé sous
le poids de ses idées, il s'arracha à son bonheur, rentra chez lui, ne
mangea pas, ne dormit point. Le lendemain, il entra dans son atelier
pour n'en sortir qu'après avoir déposé sur une toile la magie de cette
scène dont le souvenir l'avait en quelque sorte fanatisé. Sa félicité
fut incomplète tant qu'il ne posséda pas un fidèle portrait de son
idole. Il passa plusieurs fois devant la maison du Chat-qui-pelote; il
osa même y entrer une ou deux fois sous le masque d'un déguisement, afin
de voir de plus près la ravissante créature que madame Guillaume
couvrait de son aile. Pendant huit mois entiers, adonné à son amour, à
ses pinceaux, il resta invisible pour ses amis les plus intimes,
oubliant le monde, la poésie, le théâtre, la musique, et ses plus chères
habitudes. Un matin, Girodet força toutes ces consignes que les artistes
connaissent et savent éluder, parvint à lui, et le réveilla par cette
demande:--Que mettras-tu au Salon? L'artiste saisit la main de son ami,
l'entraîne à son atelier, découvre un petit tableau de chevalet et un
portrait. Après une lente et avide contemplation des deux
chefs-d'oeuvre, Girodet saute au cou de son camarade et l'embrasse, sans
trouver de paroles. Ses émotions ne pouvaient se rendre que comme il les
sentait, d'âme à âme.
--Tu es amoureux? dit Girodet.
Tous deux savaient que les plus beaux portraits de Titien, de Raphaël et
de Léonard de Vinci sont dus à des sentiments exaltés, qui, sous
diverses conditions, engendrent d'ailleurs tous les chefs-d'oeuvre. Pour
toute réponse, le jeune artiste inclina la tête.
--Es-tu heureux de pouvoir être amoureux ici, en revenant d'Italie! Je
ne te conseille pas de mettre de telles oeuvres au Salon, ajouta le
grand peintre. Vois-tu, ces deux tableaux n'y seraient pas sentis. Ces
couleurs vraies, ce travail prodigieux ne peuvent pas encore être
appréciés, le public n'est plus accoutumé à tant de profondeur. Les
tableaux que nous peignons, mon bon ami, sont des écrans, des paravents.
Tiens, faisons plutôt des vers, et traduisons les Anciens! il y a plus
de gloire à en attendre, que de nos malheureuses toiles.
Malgré cet avis charitable, les deux toiles furent exposées. La scène
d'intérieur fit une révolution dans la peinture. Elle donna naissance à
ces tableaux de genre dont la prodigieuse quantité importée à toutes nos
expositions, pourrait faire croire qu'ils s'obtiennent par des procédés
purement mécaniques. Quant au portrait, il est peu d'artistes qui ne
gardent le souvenir de cette toile vivante à laquelle le public,
quelquefois juste en masse, laissa la couronne que Girodet y plaça
lui-même. Les deux tableaux furent entourés d'une foule immense. On s'y
tua, comme disent les femmes. Des spéculateurs, des grands seigneurs
couvrirent ces deux toiles de doubles napoléons, l'artiste refusa
obstinément de les vendre, et refusa d'en faire des copies. On lui
offrit une somme énorme pour les laisser graver, les marchands ne furent
pas plus heureux que ne l'avaient été les amateurs. Quoique cette
aventure fît du bruit dans le monde, elle n'était pas de nature à
parvenir au fond de la petite Thébaïde de la rue Saint-Denis. Néanmoins,
en venant faire une visite à madame Guillaume, la femme du notaire parla
de l'exposition devant Augustine, qu'elle aimait beaucoup, et lui en
expliqua le but. Le babil de madame Roguin inspira naturellement à
Augustine le désir de voir les tableaux, et la hardiesse de demander
secrètement à sa cousine de l'accompagner au Louvre. La cousine réussit
dans la négociation qu'elle entama auprès de madame Guillaume, pour
obtenir la permission d'arracher sa petite cousine à ses tristes travaux
pendant environ deux heures. La jeune fille pénétra donc, à travers la
foule, jusqu'au tableau couronné. Un frisson la fit trembler comme une
feuille de bouleau, quand elle se reconnut. Elle eut peur et regarda
autour d'elle pour rejoindre madame Roguin, de qui elle avait été
séparée par un flot de monde. En ce moment ses yeux effrayés
rencontrèrent la figure enflammée du jeune peintre. Elle se rappela tout
à coup la physionomie d'un promeneur que, curieuse, elle avait souvent
remarqué, en croyant que c'était un nouveau voisin.
--Vous voyez ce que l'amour m'a fait faire, dit l'artiste à l'oreille de
la timide créature qui resta tout épouvantée de ces paroles.
Elle trouva un courage surnaturel pour fendre la presse, et pour
rejoindre sa cousine encore occupée à percer la masse du monde qui
l'empêchait d'arriver jusqu'au tableau.
--Vous seriez étouffée, s'écria Augustine, partons!
Mais il se rencontre, au Salon, certains moments pendant lesquels deux
femmes ne sont pas toujours libres de diriger leurs pas dans les
galeries. Mademoiselle Guillaume et sa cousine furent poussées à
quelques pas du second tableau, par suite des mouvements irréguliers que
la foule leur imprima. Le hasard voulut qu'elles eussent la facilité
d'approcher ensemble de la toile illustrée par la mode, d'accord cette
fois avec le talent. La femme du notaire fit une exclamation de surprise
perdue dans le brouhaha et les bourdonnements de la foule; mais
Augustine pleura involontairement à l'aspect de cette merveilleuse
scène. Puis, par un sentiment presque inexplicable, elle mit un doigt
sur ses lèvres en apercevant à deux pas d'elle la figure extatique du
jeune artiste. L'inconnu répondit par un signe de tête et désigna madame
Roguin, comme un trouble-fête, afin de montrer à Augustine qu'elle
était comprise. Cette pantomime jeta comme un brasier dans le corps de
la pauvre fille qui se trouva criminelle, en se figurant qu'il venait de
se conclure un pacte entre elle et l'artiste. Une chaleur étouffante, le
continuel aspect des plus brillantes toilettes, et l'étourdissement que
produisait sur Augustine la vérité des couleurs, la multitude des
figures vivantes ou peintes, la profusion des cadres d'or, lui firent
éprouver une espèce d'enivrement qui redoubla ses craintes. Elle se
serait peut-être évanouie, si, malgré ce chaos de sensations, il ne
s'était élevé au fond de son coeur une jouissance inconnue qui vivifia
tout son être. Néanmoins, elle se crut sous l'empire de ce démon dont
les terribles piéges lui étaient prédits par la voix tonnante des
prédicateurs. Ce moment fut pour elle comme un moment de folie. Elle se
vit accompagnée jusqu'à la voiture de sa cousine par ce jeune homme
resplendissant de bonheur et d'amour. En proie à une irritation toute
nouvelle, à une ivresse qui la livrait en quelque sorte à la nature,
Augustine écouta la voix éloquente de son coeur, et regarda plusieurs
fois le jeune peintre en laissant paraître le trouble dont elle était
saisie. Jamais l'incarnat de ses joues n'avait formé de plus vigoureux
contrastes avec la blancheur de sa peau. L'artiste aperçut alors cette
beauté dans toute sa fleur, cette pudeur dans toute sa gloire. Augustine
éprouva une sorte de joie mêlée de terreur, en pensant que sa présence
causait la félicité de celui dont le nom était sur toutes les lèvres,
dont le talent donnait l'immortalité à de passagères images. Elle était
aimée! il lui était impossible d'en douter. Quand elle ne vit plus
l'artiste, elle entendit encore retentir dans son coeur ces paroles
simples:--«Vous voyez ce que l'amour m'a fait faire.» Et les
palpitations devenues plus profondes lui semblèrent une douleur, tant
son sang plus ardent réveilla dans son corps de puissances inconnues.
Elle feignit d'avoir un grand mal de tête pour éviter de répondre aux
questions de sa cousine relativement aux tableaux; mais, au retour,
madame Roguin ne put s'empêcher de parler à madame Guillaume de la
célébrité obtenue par le Chat-qui-pelote, et Augustine trembla de tous
ses membres en entendant dire à sa mère qu'elle irait au Salon pour y
voir sa maison. La jeune fille insista de nouveau sur sa souffrance, et
obtint la permission d'aller se coucher.
--Voilà ce qu'on gagne à tous ces spectacles, s'écria monsieur
Guillaume, des maux de tête. Est-ce donc bien amusant de voir en
peinture ce qu'on rencontre tous les jours dans notre rue! Ne me parlez
pas de ces artistes qui sont, comme vos auteurs, des meurt-de-faim. Que
diable ont-ils besoin de prendre ma maison pour la vilipender dans leurs
tableaux?
--Cela pourra nous faire vendre quelques aunes de drap de plus, dit
Joseph Lebas.
Cette observation n'empêcha pas que les arts et la pensée ne fussent
condamnés encore une fois au tribunal du Négoce. Comme on doit bien le
penser, ces discours ne donnèrent pas grand espoir à Augustine. Elle eut
toute la nuit pour se livrer à la première méditation de l'amour. Les
événements de cette journée furent comme un songe qu'elle se plut à
reproduire dans sa pensée. Elle s'initia aux craintes, aux espérances,
aux remords, à toutes ces ondulations de sentiment qui devaient bercer
un coeur simple et timide comme le sien. Quel vide elle reconnut dans
cette noire maison, et quel trésor elle trouva dans son âme! Être la
femme d'un homme de talent, partager sa gloire! Quels ravages cette idée
ne devait-elle pas faire au coeur d'une enfant élevée au sein de cette
famille! Quelle espérance ne devait-elle pas éveiller chez une jeune
personne qui, nourrie jusqu'alors de principes vulgaires, avait désiré
une vie élégante! Un rayon de soleil était tombé dans cette prison.
Augustine aima tout à coup. En elle tant de sentiments étaient flattés à
la fois, qu'elle succomba sans rien calculer. A dix-huit ans, l'amour ne
jette-t-il pas son prisme entre le monde et les yeux d'une jeune fille!
Incapable de deviner les rudes chocs qui résultent de l'alliance d'une
femme aimante avec un homme d'imagination, elle crut être appelée à
faire le bonheur de celui-ci, sans apercevoir aucune disparate entre
elle et lui. Pour elle le présent fut tout l'avenir. Quand le lendemain
son père et sa mère revinrent du Salon, leurs figures attristées
annoncèrent quelque désappointement. D'abord, les deux tableaux avaient
été retirés par le peintre; puis madame Guillaume avait perdu son châle
de cachemire. Apprendre que les tableaux venaient de disparaître après
sa visite au Salon fut pour Augustine la révélation d'une délicatesse de
sentiment que les femmes savent toujours apprécier, même
instinctivement.
Le matin où, rentrant d'un bal, Théodore de Sommervieux, tel était le
nom que la renommée avait apporté dans le coeur d'Augustine, fut
aspergé par les commis du Chat-qui-pelote pendant qu'il attendait
l'apparition de sa naïve amie, qui ne le savait certes pas là, les deux
amants se voyaient pour la quatrième fois seulement depuis la scène du
Salon. Les obstacles que le régime de la maison Guillaume opposait au
caractère fougueux de l'artiste, donnaient à sa passion pour Augustine
une violence facile à concevoir. Comment aborder une jeune fille assise
dans un comptoir entre deux femmes telles que mademoiselle Virginie et
madame Guillaume? Comment correspondre avec elle, quand sa mère ne la
quittait jamais? Habile, comme tous les amants, à se forger des
malheurs, Théodore se créait un rival dans l'un des commis, et mettait
les autres dans les intérêts de son rival. S'il échappait à tant
d'Argus, il se voyait échouant sous les yeux sévères du vieux négociant
ou de madame Guillaume. Partout des barrières, partout le désespoir! La
violence même de sa passion empêchait le jeune peintre de trouver ces
expédients ingénieux qui, chez les prisonniers comme chez les amants,
semblent être le dernier effort de la raison échauffée par un sauvage
besoin de liberté ou par le feu de l'amour. Théodore tournait alors dans
le quartier avec l'activité d'un fou, comme si le mouvement pouvait lui
suggérer des ruses. Après s'être bien tourmenté l'imagination, il
inventa de gagner à prix d'or la servante joufflue. Quelques lettres
furent donc échangées de loin en loin pendant la quinzaine qui suivit la
malencontreuse matinée où monsieur Guillaume et Théodore s'étaient si
bien examinés.
En ce moment, les deux jeunes gens étaient convenus de se voir à une
certaine heure du jour et le dimanche, à Saint-Leu, pendant la messe et
les vêpres. Augustine avait envoyé à son cher Théodore la liste des
parents et des amis de la famille, chez lesquels le jeune peintre tâcha
d'avoir accès afin d'intéresser à ses amoureuses pensées, s'il était
possible, une de ces âmes occupées d'argent, de commerce, et auxquelles
une passion véritable devait sembler la spéculation la plus monstrueuse,
une spéculation inouïe. D'ailleurs, rien ne changea dans les habitudes
du Chat-qui-pelote. Si Augustine fut distraite, si, contre toute espèce
d'obéissance aux lois de la charte domestique, elle monta à sa chambre
pour y aller, grâce à un pot de fleurs, établir des signaux; si elle
soupira, si elle pensa enfin, personne, pas même sa mère, ne s'en
aperçut. Cette circonstance causera quelque surprise à ceux qui auront
compris l'esprit de cette maison, où une pensée entachée de poésie
devait produire un contraste avec les êtres et les choses, où personne
ne pouvait se permettre ni un geste, ni un regard qui ne fussent vus et
analysés. Cependant rien de plus naturel: le vaisseau si tranquille qui
naviguait sur la mer orageuse de la place de Paris, sous le pavillon du
Chat-qui-pelote, était la proie d'une de ces tempêtes qu'on pourrait
nommer équinoxiales à cause de leur retour périodique. Depuis quinze
jours, les quatre hommes de l'équipage, madame Guillaume et mademoiselle
Virginie s'adonnaient à ce travail excessif désigné sous le nom
d'_inventaire_. On remuait tous les ballots et l'on vérifiait l'aunage
des pièces pour s'assurer de la valeur exacte du coupon. On examinait
soigneusement la carte appendue au paquet pour reconnaître en quel temps
les draps avaient été achetés. On fixait le prix actuel. Toujours
debout, son aune à la main, la plume derrière l'oreille, monsieur
Guillaume ressemblait à un capitaine commandant la manoeuvre. Sa voix
aiguë, passant par un judas pour interroger la profondeur des
écoutilles du magasin d'en bas, faisait entendre ces barbares
locutions du commerce, qui ne s'exprime que par énigmes:--Combien
d'H-N-Z?--Enlevé.--Que reste-t-il de Q-X?--Deux aunes.--Quel
prix?--Cinq-cinq-trois.--Portez à trois A tout J-J, tout M-P, et le
reste de V-D-O. Mille autres phrases tout aussi intelligibles ronflaient
à travers les comptoirs comme des vers de la poésie moderne que des
romantiques se seraient cités afin d'entretenir leur enthousiasme pour
un de leurs poëtes. Le soir, Guillaume, enfermé avec son commis et sa
femme, soldait les comptes, portait à nouveau, écrivait aux
retardataires, et dressait des factures. Tous trois préparaient ce
travail immense dont le résultat tenait sur un carré de papier tellière,
et prouvait à la maison Guillaume qu'il existait tant en argent, tant en
marchandises, tant en traites et billets; qu'elle ne devait pas un sou,
qu'il lui était dû cent ou deux cent mille francs; que le capital avait
augmenté; que les fermes, les maisons, les rentes allaient être ou
arrondies, ou réparées, ou doublées. De là résultait la nécessité de
recommencer avec plus d'ardeur que jamais à ramasser de nouveaux écus,
sans qu'il vînt en tête à ces courageuses fourmis de se demander: A quoi
bon?
A la faveur de ce tumulte annuel, l'heureuse Augustine échappait à
l'investigation de ses Argus. Enfin, un samedi soir, la clôture de
l'inventaire eut lieu. Les chiffres du total actif offrirent assez de
zéros pour qu'en cette circonstance Guillaume levât la consigne sévère
qui régnait toute l'année au dessert. Le sournois drapier se frotta les
mains, et permit à ses commis de rester à sa table. A peine chacun des
hommes de l'équipage achevait-il son petit verre d'une liqueur de
ménage, on entendit le roulement d'une voiture. La famille alla voir
Cendrillon aux Variétés, tandis que les deux derniers commis reçurent
chacun un écu de six francs et la permission d'aller où bon leur
semblerait, pourvu qu'ils fussent rentrés à minuit. Malgré cette
débauche, le dimanche matin, le vieux marchand drapier fit sa barbe dès
six heures, endossa son habit marron dont les superbes reflets lui
causaient toujours le même contentement, il attacha les boucles d'or aux
oreilles de son ample culotte de soie; puis, vers sept heures, au moment
où tout dormait encore dans la maison, il se dirigea vers le petit
cabinet attenant à son magasin du premier étage. Le jour y venait d'une
croisée armée de gros barreaux de fer, et qui donnait sur une petite
cour carrée formée de murs si noirs qu'elle ressemblait assez à un
puits. Le vieux négociant ouvrit lui-même ces volets garnis de tôle
qu'il connaissait si bien, et releva une moitié du vitrage en le faisant
glisser dans sa coulisse. L'air glacé de la cour vint rafraîchir la
chaude atmosphère de ce cabinet, qui exhalait l'odeur particulière aux
bureaux. Le marchand resta debout, la main posée sur le bras crasseux
d'un fauteuil de canne doublé de maroquin dont la couleur primitive
était effacée, il semblait hésiter à s'y asseoir. Il regarda d'un air
attendri le bureau à double pupitre, où la place de sa femme se trouvait
ménagée, dans le côté opposé à la sienne, par une petite arcade
pratiquée dans le mur. Il contempla les cartons numérotés, les ficelles,
les ustensiles, les fers à marquer le drap, la caisse, objets d'une
origine immémoriale, et crut se revoir devant l'ombre évoquée du sieur
Chevrel. Il avança le même tabouret sur lequel il s'était jadis assis en
présence de son défunt patron. Ce tabouret garni de cuir noir, et dont
le crin s'échappait depuis longtemps par les coins, mais sans se perdre,
il le plaça d'une main tremblante au même endroit où son prédécesseur
l'avait mis; puis, dans une agitation difficile à décrire, il tira la
sonnette qui correspondait au chevet du lit de Joseph Lebas. Quand ce
coup décisif eut été frappé, le vieillard, pour qui ces souvenirs furent
sans doute trop lourds, prit trois ou quatre lettres de change qui lui
avaient été présentées, et les regarda sans les voir, quand Joseph Lebas
se montra soudain.
--Asseyez-vous là, lui dit Guillaume en lui désignant le tabouret.
Comme jamais le vieux maître-drapier n'avait fait asseoir son commis
devant lui, Joseph Lebas tressaillit.
--Que pensez-vous de ces traites? demanda Guillaume.
--Elles ne seront pas payées.
--Comment?
--Mais j'ai su qu'avant-hier Étienne et compagnie ont fait leurs
paiements en or.
--Oh! oh! s'écria le drapier, il faut être bien malade pour laisser voir
sa bile. Parlons d'autre chose. Joseph, l'inventaire est fini.
--Oui, monsieur, et le dividende est un des plus beaux que vous ayez
eus.
--Ne vous servez donc pas de ces nouveaux mots! Dites le produit,
Joseph. Savez-vous, mon garçon, que c'est un peu à vous que nous devons
ces résultats? aussi, ne veux-je plus que vous ayez d'appointements.
Madame Guillaume m'a donné l'idée de vous offrir un intérêt. Hein,
Joseph! Guillaume et Lebas, ces mots ne feraient-ils pas une belle
raison sociale? On pourrait mettre _et compagnie_ pour arrondir la
signature.
Les larmes vinrent aux yeux de Joseph Lebas, qui s'efforça de les
cacher.--Ah, monsieur Guillaume! comment ai-je pu mériter tant de
bontés? Je ne fais que mon devoir. C'était déjà tant que de vous
intéresser à un pauvre orph...
Il brossait le parement de sa manche gauche avec la manche droite, et
n'osait regarder le vieillard qui souriait en pensant que ce modeste
jeune homme avait sans doute besoin, comme lui autrefois, d'être
encouragé pour rendre l'explication complète.
--Cependant, reprit le père de Virginie, vous ne méritez pas beaucoup
cette faveur, Joseph! Vous ne mettez pas en moi autant de confiance que
j'en mets en vous. (Le commis releva brusquement la tête.)--Vous avez le
secret de la caisse. Depuis deux ans je vous ai dit presque toutes mes
affaires. Je vous ai fait voyager en fabrique. Enfin, pour vous, je n'ai
rien sur le coeur. Mais vous?... vous avez une inclination, et ne m'en
avez pas touché un seul mot. (Joseph Lebas rougit.)--Ah! ah! s'écria
Guillaume, vous pensiez donc tromper un vieux renard comme moi? Moi! à
qui vous avez vu deviner la faillite Lecoq!
--Comment, monsieur? répondit Joseph Lebas en examinant son patron avec
autant d'attention que son patron l'examinait, comment, vous sauriez qui
j'aime?
--Je sais tout, vaurien, lui dit le respectable et rusé marchand en lui
tordant le bout de l'oreille. Et je pardonne, j'ai fait de même.
--Et vous me l'accorderiez?
--Oui, avec cinquante mille écus, et je t'en laisserai autant, et nous
marcherons sur nouveaux frais avec une nouvelle raison sociale. Nous
brasserons encore des affaires, garçon, s'écria le vieux marchand en
s'exaltant, se levant et agitant ses bras. Vois-tu, mon gendre, il n'y a
que le commerce! Ceux qui se demandent quels plaisirs on y trouve sont
des imbéciles. Être à la piste des affaires, savoir gouverner sur la
place, attendre avec anxiété, comme au jeu, si les Étienne et compagnie
font faillite, voir passer un régiment de la garde impériale habillé de
notre drap, donner un croc en jambe au voisin, loyalement s'entend!
fabriquer à meilleur marché que les autres; suivre une affaire qu'on
ébauche, qui commence, grandit, chancelle et réussit, connaître comme un
ministre de la police tous les ressorts des maisons de commerce pour ne
pas faire fausse route; se tenir debout devant les naufrages; avoir des
amis, par correspondance, dans toutes les villes manufacturières,
n'est-ce pas un jeu perpétuel, Joseph? Mais c'est vivre, ça! Je mourrai
dans ce tracas-là, comme le vieux Chevrel, n'en prenant cependant plus
qu'à mon aise. Dans la chaleur de sa plus forte improvisation, le père
Guillaume n'avait presque pas regardé son commis qui pleurait à chaudes
larmes.--Eh bien! Joseph, mon pauvre garçon, qu'as-tu donc?
--Ah! je l'aime tant, tant, monsieur Guillaume, que le coeur me manque,
je crois...
--Eh bien! garçon, dit le marchand attendri, tu es plus heureux que tu
ne crois, sarpejeu, car elle t'aime. Je le sais, moi!
Et il cligna ses deux petits yeux verts en regardant son commis.
--Mademoiselle Augustine, mademoiselle Augustine! s'écria Joseph Lebas
dans son enthousiasme.
Il allait s'élancer hors du cabinet, quand il se sentit arrêté par un
bras de fer, et son patron stupéfait le ramena vigoureusement devant
lui.
--Qu'est-ce que fait donc Augustine dans cette affaire-là? demanda
Guillaume dont la voix glaça sur-le-champ le malheureux Joseph Lebas.
--N'est-ce pas elle... que... j'aime? dit le commis en balbutiant.
Déconcerté de son défaut de perspicacité, Guillaume se rassit et mit sa
tête pointue dans ses deux mains pour réfléchir à la bizarre position
dans laquelle il se trouvait. Joseph Lebas honteux et au désespoir resta
debout.
--Joseph, reprit le négociant avec une dignité froide, je vous parlais
de Virginie. L'amour ne se commande pas, je le sais. Je connais votre
discrétion, nous oublierons cela. Je ne marierai jamais Augustine avant
Virginie. Votre intérêt sera de dix pour cent.
Le commis, auquel l'amour donna je ne sais quel degré de courage et
d'éloquence, joignit les mains, prit la parole, parla pendant un quart
d'heure à Guillaume avec tant de chaleur et de sensibilité, que la
situation changea. S'il s'était agi d'une affaire commerciale, le vieux
négociant aurait eu des règles fixes pour prendre une résolution; mais,
jeté à mille lieues du commerce, sur la mer des sentiments, et sans
boussole, il flotta irrésolu devant un événement si original, se
disait-il. Entraîné par sa bonté naturelle, il battit un peu la
campagne.
--Et, diantre, Joseph, tu n'es pas sans savoir que j'ai eu mes deux
enfants à dix ans de distance! Mademoiselle Chevrel n'était pas belle,
elle n'a cependant pas à se plaindre de moi. Fais donc comme moi. Enfin,
ne pleure pas, es-tu bête? Que veux-tu? cela s'arrangera peut-être, nous
verrons. Il y a toujours moyen de se tirer d'affaire. Nous autres hommes
nous ne sommes pas toujours comme des Céladons pour nos femmes. Tu
m'entends? Madame Guillaume est dévote, et... Allons, sarpejeu, mon
enfant, donne ce matin le bras à Augustine pour aller à la messe.
Telles furent les phrases jetées à l'aventure par Guillaume. La
conclusion qui les terminait ravit l'amoureux commis: il songeait déjà
pour mademoiselle Virginie à l'un de ses amis, quand il sortit du
cabinet enfumé en serrant la main de son futur beau-père, après lui
avoir dit, d'un petit air entendu, que tout s'arrangerait au mieux.
--Que va penser madame Guillaume? Cette idée tourmenta prodigieusement
le brave négociant quand il fut seul.
Au déjeuner, madame Guillaume et Virginie, auxquelles le
marchand-drapier avait laissé provisoirement ignorer son
désappointement, regardèrent assez malicieusement Joseph Lebas qui
resta grandement embarrassé. La pudeur du commis lui concilia l'amitié
de sa belle-mère. La matrone redevint si gaie qu'elle regarda monsieur
Guillaume en souriant, et se permit quelques petites plaisanteries d'un
usage immémorial dans ces innocentes familles. Elle mit en question la
conformité de la taille de Virginie et de celle de Joseph, pour leur
demander de se mesurer. Ces niaiseries préparatoires attirèrent quelques
nuages sur le front du chef de famille, et il afficha même un tel amour
pour le décorum, qu'il ordonna à Augustine de prendre le bras du premier
commis en allant à Saint-Leu. Madame Guillaume, étonnée de cette
délicatesse masculine, honora son mari d'un signe de tête d'approbation.
Le cortége partit donc de la maison dans un ordre qui ne pouvait
suggérer aucune interprétation malicieuse aux voisins.
--Ne trouvez-vous pas, mademoiselle Augustine, disait le commis en
tremblant, que la femme d'un négociant qui a un bon crédit, comme
monsieur Guillaume, par exemple, pourrait s'amuser un peu plus que ne
s'amuse madame votre mère, pourrait porter des diamants, aller en
voiture? Oh! moi, d'abord, si je me mariais, je voudrais avoir toute la
peine, et voir ma femme heureuse. Je ne la mettrais pas dans mon
comptoir. Voyez-vous, dans la draperie, les femmes n'y sont plus aussi
nécessaires qu'elles l'étaient autrefois. Monsieur Guillaume a eu raison
d'agir comme il a fait, et d'ailleurs c'était le goût de son épouse.
Mais qu'une femme sache donner un coup de main à la comptabilité, à la
correspondance, au détail, aux commandes, à son ménage, afin de ne pas
rester oisive, c'est tout. A sept heures, quand la boutique serait
fermée, moi je m'amuserais, j'irais au spectacle et dans le monde. Mais
vous ne m'écoutez pas.
--Si fait, monsieur Joseph. Que dites-vous de la peinture? C'est là un
bel état.
--Oui, je connais un maître peintre en bâtiment, monsieur Lourdois, qui
a des écus.
En devisant ainsi, la famille atteignit l'église de Saint-Leu. Là,
madame Guillaume retrouva ses droits, et fit mettre, pour la première
fois, Augustine à côté d'elle. Virginie prit place sur la quatrième
chaise à côté de Lebas. Pendant le prône, tout alla bien entre Augustine
et Théodore qui, debout derrière un pilier, priait sa madone avec
ferveur; mais au lever-Dieu, madame Guillaume s'aperçut, un peu tard,
que sa fille Augustine tenait son livre de messe au rebours. Elle se
disposait à la gourmander vigoureusement, quand, rabaissant son voile,
elle interrompit sa lecture et se mit à regarder dans la direction
qu'affectionnaient les yeux de sa fille. A l'aide de ses besicles, elle
vit le jeune artiste dont l'élégance mondaine annonçait plutôt quelque
capitaine de cavalerie en congé, qu'un négociant du quartier. Il est
difficile d'imaginer l'état violent dans lequel se trouva madame
Guillaume, qui se flattait d'avoir parfaitement élevé ses filles, en
reconnaissant dans le coeur d'Augustine un amour clandestin dont le
danger lui fut exagéré par sa pruderie et son ignorance. Elle crut sa
fille gangrenée jusqu'au coeur.
--Tenez d'abord votre livre à l'endroit, mademoiselle, dit-elle à voix
basse mais en tremblant de colère. Elle arracha vivement le Paroissien
accusateur, et le remit de manière à ce que les lettres fussent dans
leur sens naturel.--N'ayez pas le malheur de lever les yeux autre part
que sur vos prières, ajouta-t-elle, autrement, vous auriez affaire à
moi. Après la messe, votre père et moi nous aurons à vous parler.
Ces paroles furent comme un coup de foudre pour la pauvre Augustine.
Elle se sentit défaillir; mais combattue entre la douleur qu'elle
éprouvait et la crainte de faire un esclandre dans l'église, elle eut le
courage de cacher ses angoisses. Cependant, il était facile de deviner
l'état violent de son âme en voyant son Paroissien trembler et des
larmes tomber sur chacune des pages qu'elle tournait. Au regard enflammé
que lui lança madame Guillaume, l'artiste vit le péril où tombaient ses
amours, et sortit, la rage dans le coeur, décidé à tout oser.
--Allez dans votre chambre, mademoiselle! dit madame Guillaume à sa
fille en rentrant au logis; nous vous ferons appeler; et surtout, ne
vous avisez pas d'en sortir.
La conférence que les deux époux eurent ensemble fut si secrète, que
rien n'en transpira d'abord. Cependant, Virginie, qui avait encouragé sa
soeur par mille douces représentations, poussa la complaisance jusqu'à
se glisser auprès de la porte de la chambre à coucher de sa mère, chez
laquelle la discussion avait lieu, pour y recueillir quelques phrases.
Au premier voyage qu'elle fit du troisième au second étage, elle
entendit son père qui s'écriait:--Madame, vous voulez donc tuer votre
fille?
--Ma pauvre enfant, dit Virginie à sa soeur éplorée, papa prend ta
défense!
--Et que veulent-ils faire à Théodore? demanda l'innocente créature.
La curieuse Virginie redescendit alors; mais cette fois elle resta plus
longtemps: elle apprit que Lebas aimait Augustine. Il était écrit que,
dans cette mémorable journée, une maison ordinairement si calme serait
un enfer. Monsieur Guillaume désespéra Joseph Lebas en lui confiant
l'amour d'Augustine pour un étranger. Lebas, qui avait averti son ami de
demander mademoiselle Virginie en mariage, vit ses espérances
renversées. Mademoiselle Virginie, accablée de savoir que Joseph l'avait
en quelque sorte refusée, fut prise d'une migraine. La zizanie semée
entre les deux époux par l'explication que monsieur et madame Guillaume
avaient eue ensemble, et où, pour la troisième fois de leur vie, ils se
trouvèrent d'opinions différentes, se manifesta d'une manière terrible.
Enfin, à quatre heures après midi, Augustine, pâle, tremblante et les
yeux rouges, comparut devant son père et sa mère. La pauvre enfant
raconta naïvement la trop courte histoire de ses amours. Rassurée par
l'allocution de son père, qui lui avait promis de l'écouter en silence,
elle prit un certain courage en prononçant devant ses parents le nom de
son cher Théodore de Sommervieux, et en fit malicieusement sonner la
particule aristocratique. En se livrant au charme inconnu de parler de
ses sentiments, elle trouva assez de hardiesse pour déclarer avec une
innocente fermeté qu'elle aimait monsieur de Sommervieux, qu'elle le lui
avait écrit, et ajouta, les larmes aux yeux:--Ce serait faire mon
malheur que de me sacrifier à un autre.
--Mais, Augustine, vous ne savez donc pas ce que c'est qu'un peintre?
s'écria sa mère avec horreur.
--Madame Guillaume! dit le vieux père en imposant silence à sa
femme.--Augustine, dit-il, les artistes sont en général des
meurt-de-faim. Ils sont trop dépensiers pour ne pas être toujours de
mauvais sujets. J'ai fourni feu M. Joseph Vernet, feu M. Lekain et feu
M. Noverre. Ah! si tu savais combien ce M. Noverre, M. le chevalier de
Saint-Georges, et surtout M. Philidor, ont joué de tours à ce pauvre
père Chevrel! Ce sont de drôles de corps, je le sais bien. Ça vous a
tous un babil, des manières... Ah! jamais ton monsieur Sumer... Somm...
--De Sommervieux, mon père!
--Eh bien! de Sommervieux, soit! jamais il n'aura été aussi agréable
avec toi que M. le chevalier de Saint-Georges le fut avec moi, le jour
où j'obtins une sentence des consuls contre lui. Aussi était-ce des gens
de qualité d'autrefois.
--Mais, mon père, monsieur Théodore est noble, et m'a écrit qu'il était
riche. Son père s'appelait le chevalier de Sommervieux avant la
révolution.
A ces paroles, monsieur Guillaume regarda sa terrible moitié, qui, en
femme contrariée, frappait le plancher du bout du pied et gardait un
morne silence. Elle évitait même de jeter ses yeux courroucés sur
Augustine, et semblait laisser à monsieur Guillaume toute la
responsabilité d'une affaire si grave, puisque ses avis n'étaient pas
écoutés. Cependant, malgré son flegme apparent, quand elle vit son mari
prenant si doucement son parti sur une catastrophe qui n'avait rien de
commercial, elle s'écria:--En vérité, monsieur, vous êtes d'une
faiblesse avec vos filles... mais...
Le bruit d'une voiture qui s'arrêtait à la porte interrompit tout à coup
la mercuriale que le vieux négociant redoutait déjà. En un moment,
madame Roguin se trouva au milieu de la chambre, et, regardant les trois
acteurs de cette scène domestique:--Je sais tout, ma cousine, dit-elle
d'un air de protection.
Madame Roguin avait un défaut, celui de croire que la femme d'un notaire
de Paris pouvait jouer le rôle d'une petite maîtresse.
--Je sais tout, répéta-t-elle, et je viens dans l'arche de Noé, comme la
colombe, avec la branche d'olivier. J'ai lu cette allégorie dans le
_Génie du Christianisme_, dit-elle en se retournant vers madame
Guillaume, la comparaison doit vous plaire, ma cousine. Savez-vous,
ajouta-t-elle en souriant à Augustine, que ce monsieur de Sommervieux
est un homme charmant? Il m'a donné ce matin mon portrait fait de main
de maître. Cela vaut au moins six mille francs.
A ces mots, elle frappa doucement sur les bras de monsieur Guillaume. Le
vieux négociant ne put s'empêcher de faire avec ses lèvres une grosse
moue qui lui était particulière.
--Je connais beaucoup monsieur de Sommervieux, reprit la colombe. Depuis
une quinzaine de jours il vient à mes soirées, il en fait le charme. Il
m'a conté toutes ses peines et m'a prise pour avocat. Je sais de ce
matin qu'il adore Augustine, et il l'aura. Ah! cousine, n'agitez pas
ainsi la tête en signe de refus. Apprenez qu'il sera créé baron, et
qu'il vient d'être nommé chevalier de la Légion-d'Honneur par l'empereur
lui-même, au Salon. Roguin est devenu son notaire et connaît ses
affaires. Eh bien! monsieur de Sommervieux possède en bons biens au
soleil douze mille livres de rente. Savez-vous que le beau-père d'un
homme comme lui peut devenir quelque chose, maire de son arrondissement,
par exemple! N'avez-vous pas vu monsieur Dupont être fait comte de
l'empire et sénateur pour être venu, en sa qualité de maire,
complimenter l'empereur sur son entrée à Vienne. Oh! ce mariage-là se
fera. Je l'adore, moi, ce bon jeune homme. Sa conduite envers Augustine
ne se voit que dans les romans. Va, ma petite, tu seras heureuse, et
tout le monde voudrait être à ta place. J'ai chez moi, à mes soirées,
madame la duchesse de Carigliano qui raffole de monsieur de Sommervieux.
Quelques méchantes langues disent qu'elle ne vient chez moi que pour
lui, comme si une duchesse d'hier était déplacée chez une Chevrel dont
la famille a cent ans de bonne bourgeoisie.
--Augustine, reprit madame Roguin après une petite pause, j'ai vu le
portrait. Dieu! qu'il est beau! Sais-tu que l'empereur a voulu le voir?
Il a dit en riant au Vice-Connétable que s'il y avait beaucoup de femmes
comme celle-là à sa cour pendant qu'il y venait tant de rois, il se
faisait fort de maintenir toujours la paix en Europe. Est-ce flatteur?
Les orages par lesquels cette journée avait commencé devaient ressembler
à ceux de la nature, en ramenant un temps calme et serein. Madame Roguin
déploya tant de séductions dans ses discours, elle sut attaquer tant de
cordes à la fois dans les coeurs secs de monsieur et de madame
Guillaume, qu'elle finit par en trouver une dont elle tira parti. A
cette singulière époque, le commerce et la finance avaient plus que
jamais la folle manie de s'allier aux grands seigneurs, et les généraux
de l'empire profitèrent assez bien de ces dispositions. Monsieur
Guillaume s'élevait singulièrement contre cette déplorable passion. Ses
axiomes favoris étaient que, pour trouver le bonheur, une femme devait
épouser un homme de sa classe; on était toujours tôt ou tard puni
d'avoir voulu monter trop haut; l'amour résistait si peu aux tracas du
ménage, qu'il fallait trouver l'un chez l'autre des qualités bien
solides pour être heureux; il ne fallait pas que l'un des deux époux en
sût plus que l'autre, parce qu'on devait avant tout se comprendre; un
mari qui parlait grec et la femme latin, risquaient de mourir de faim.
Il avait inventé cette espèce de proverbe. Il comparait les mariages
ainsi faits à ces anciennes étoffes de soie et de laine, dont la soie
finissait toujours par couper la laine. Cependant, il se trouve tant de
vanité au fond du coeur de l'homme, que la prudence du pilote qui
gouvernait si bien le Chat-qui-pelote succomba sous l'agressive
volubilité de madame Roguin. La sévère madame Guillaume, la première,
trouva dans l'inclination de sa fille des motifs pour déroger à ces
principes, et pour consentir à recevoir au logis monsieur de
Sommervieux, qu'elle se promit de soumettre à un rigoureux examen.
Le vieux négociant alla trouver Joseph Lebas, et l'instruisit de l'état
des choses. A six heures et demie, la salle à manger, illustrée par le
peintre, réunit sous son toit de verre madame et monsieur Roguin, le
jeune peintre et sa charmante Augustine, Joseph Lebas qui prenait son
bonheur en patience, et mademoiselle Virginie dont la migraine avait
cessé. Monsieur et Madame Guillaume virent en perspective leurs enfants
établis et les destinées du Chat-qui-pelote remises en des mains
habiles. Leur contentement fut au comble, quand, au dessert, Théodore
leur fit présent de l'étonnant tableau qu'ils n'avaient pu voir, et qui
représentait l'intérieur de cette vieille boutique, à laquelle était dû
tant de bonheur.
--C'est-y gentil! s'écria Guillaume. Dire qu'on voulait donner trente
mille francs de cela.
--Mais c'est qu'on y trouve mes barbes, reprit madame Guillaume.
--Et ces étoffes dépliées, ajouta Lebas, on les prendrait avec la main.
--Les draperies font toujours très-bien, répondit le peintre. Nous
serions trop heureux, nous autres artistes modernes, d'atteindre à la
perfection de la draperie antique.
--Vous aimez donc la draperie, s'écria le père Guillaume. Eh bien,
sarpejeu! touchez là, mon jeune ami. Puisque vous estimez le commerce,
nous nous entendrons. Eh! pourquoi le mépriserait-on? Le monde a
commencé par là, puisque Adam a vendu le paradis pour une pomme. Ça n'a
pas été une fameuse spéculation, par exemple!
Et le vieux négociant se mit à éclater d'un gros rire franc excité par
le vin de Champagne qu'il faisait circuler généreusement. Le bandeau qui
couvrait les yeux du jeune artiste fut si épais qu'il trouva ses futurs
parents aimables. Il ne dédaigna pas de les égayer par quelques charges
de bon goût. Aussi plut-il généralement. Le soir, quand le salon meublé
de choses très-cossues, pour se servir de l'expression de Guillaume, fut
désert; pendant que madame Guillaume s'en allait de table en cheminée,
de candélabre en flambeau, soufflant avec précipitation les bougies, le
brave négociant, qui savait toujours voir clair aussitôt qu'il
s'agissait d'affaires ou d'argent, attira sa fille Augustine auprès de
lui; puis, après l'avoir prise sur ses genoux, il lui tint ce discours:
--Ma chère enfant, tu épouseras ton Sommervieux, puisque tu le veux;
permis à toi de risquer ton capital de bonheur. Mais je ne me laisse pas
prendre à ces trente mille francs que l'on gagne à gâter de bonnes
toiles. L'argent qui vient si vite s'en va de même. N'ai-je pas entendu
dire ce soir à ce jeune écervelé que si l'argent était rond, c'était
pour rouler! S'il est rond pour les gens prodigues, il est plat pour les
gens économes qui l'empilent et l'amassent. Or, mon enfant, ce beau
garçon-là parle de te donner des voitures, des diamants? Il a de
l'argent, qu'il le dépense pour toi! _bene sit!_ Je n'ai rien à y voir.
Mais quant à ce que je te donne, je ne veux pas que des écus si
péniblement ensachés s'en aillent en carrosses ou en colifichets. Qui
dépense trop n'est jamais riche. Avec les cent mille écus de sa dot on
n'achète pas encore tout Paris. Tu as beau avoir à recueillir un jour
quelques centaines de mille francs, je te les ferai attendre, sarpejeu!
le plus longtemps possible. J'ai donc attiré ton prétendu dans un coin,
et un homme qui a mené la faillite Lecoq n'a pas eu grande peine à faire
consentir un artiste à se marier séparé de biens avec sa femme. J'aurai
l'oeil au contrat pour bien faire stipuler les donations qu'il se
propose de te constituer. Allons, mon enfant, j'espère être grand-père,
sarpejeu! je veux m'occuper déjà de mes petits-enfants: jure-moi donc
ici de ne jamais rien signer en fait d'argent que par mon conseil; et si
j'allais trouver trop tôt le père Chevrel, jure-moi de consulter le
jeune Lebas, ton beau-frère. Promets-le-moi.
--Oui, mon père, je vous le jure.
A ces mots prononcés d'une voix douce, le vieillard baisa sa fille sur
les deux joues. Ce soir-là, tous les amants dormirent presque aussi
paisiblement que monsieur et madame Guillaume.
Quelques mois après ce mémorable dimanche, le maître-autel de Saint-Leu
fut témoin de deux mariages bien différents. Augustine et Théodore s'y
présentèrent dans tout l'éclat du bonheur, les yeux pleins d'amour,
parés de toilettes élégantes, attendus par un brillant équipage. Venue
dans un bon remise avec sa famille, Virginie, donnant le bras à son
père, suivait sa jeune soeur humblement et dans de plus simples atours,
comme une ombre nécessaire aux harmonies de ce tableau. Monsieur
Guillaume s'était donné toutes les peines imaginables pour obtenir à
l'église que Virginie fût mariée avant Augustine; mais il eut la douleur
de voir le haut et le bas clergé s'adresser en toute circonstance à la
plus élégante des mariées. Il entendit quelques-uns de ses voisins
approuver singulièrement le bon sens de mademoiselle Virginie, qui
faisait, disaient-ils, le mariage le plus solide, et restait fidèle au
quartier; tandis qu'ils lancèrent quelques brocards suggérés par l'envie
sur Augustine qui épousait un artiste, un noble; ils ajoutèrent avec une
sorte d'effroi que, si les Guillaume avaient de l'ambition, la draperie
était perdue. Un vieux marchand d'éventails ayant dit que ce
mange-tout-là l'aurait bientôt mise sur la paille, le père Guillaume
s'applaudit _in petto_ de la prudence qu'il avait mise dans la rédaction
des conventions matrimoniales. Le soir, la famille se sépara après un
bal somptueux, suivi d'un de ces soupers plantureux dont le souvenir
commence à se perdre dans la génération présente. Monsieur et madame
Guillaume restèrent dans leur hôtel de la rue du Colombier où la noce
avait eu lieu. Monsieur et madame Lebas retournèrent dans leur remise à
la vieille maison de la rue Saint-Denis, pour y diriger la nauf du
Chat-qui-pelote. L'artiste, ivre de bonheur, prit entre ses bras sa
chère Augustine, l'enleva vivement quand leur coupé arriva rue des
Trois-Frères, et la porta dans son élégant appartement.
La fougue de passion qui possédait Théodore fit dévorer au jeune ménage
près d'une année entière sans que le moindre nuage vînt altérer l'azur
du ciel sous lequel ils vivaient. Pour eux, l'existence n'eut rien de
pesant. Théodore répandait sur chaque journée d'incroyables _fioriture_
de plaisirs. Il se plaisait à varier les emportements de la passion, par
la molle langueur de ces repos où les âmes sont lancées si haut dans
l'extase qu'elles semblent y oublier l'union corporelle. Incapable de
réfléchir, l'heureuse Augustine se prêtait à l'allure onduleuse de son
bonheur. Elle ne croyait pas faire encore assez en se livrant toute à
l'amour permis et saint du mariage. Simple et naïve, elle ne connaissait
ni la coquetterie des refus, ni l'empire qu'une jeune demoiselle du
grand monde se crée sur un mari par d'adroits caprices. Elle aimait trop
pour calculer l'avenir, et n'imaginait pas qu'une vie si délicieuse pût
jamais cesser. Heureuse d'être alors tous les plaisirs de son mari, elle
crut que cet inextinguible amour serait toujours pour elle la plus belle
de toutes les parures, comme son dévouement et son obéissance seraient
un éternel attrait. Enfin, la félicité de l'amour l'avait rendue si
brillante, que sa beauté lui inspira de l'orgueil et lui donna la
conscience de pouvoir toujours régner sur un homme aussi facile à
enflammer que monsieur de Sommervieux. Ainsi son état de femme ne lui
apporta d'autres enseignements que ceux de l'amour. Au sein de ce
bonheur, elle resta l'ignorante petite fille qui vivait obscurément rue
Saint-Denis, et ne pensa point à prendre les manières, l'instruction, le
ton du monde dans lequel elle devait vivre. Ses paroles étant des
paroles d'amour, elle y déployait bien une sorte de souplesse d'esprit
et une certaine délicatesse d'expression; mais elle se servait du
langage commun à toutes les femmes quand elles se trouvent plongées dans
une passion qui semble être leur élément. Si, par hasard, une idée
discordante avec celles de Théodore était exprimée par Augustine, le
jeune artiste en riait comme on rit des premières fautes que fait un
étranger, mais qui finissent par fatiguer s'il ne se corrige pas.
Cependant, à l'expiration de cette année aussi charmante que rapide,
Sommervieux sentit un matin la nécessité de reprendre ses travaux et ses
habitudes. Sa femme était enceinte. Il revit ses amis. Pendant les
longues souffrances de l'année où, pour la première fois, une jeune
femme nourrit un enfant, il travailla sans doute avec ardeur; mais
parfois il retourna chercher quelques distractions dans le grand monde.
La maison où il allait le plus volontiers était celle de la duchesse de
Carigliano qui avait fini par attirer chez elle le célèbre artiste.
Quand Augustine fut rétablie, quand son fils ne réclama plus ces soins
assidus qui interdisent à une mère les plaisirs du monde, Théodore en
était arrivé à vouloir éprouver cette jouissance d'amour-propre que nous
donne la société quand nous y apparaissons avec une belle femme, objet
d'envie et d'admiration. Parcourir les salons en s'y montrant avec
l'éclat emprunté de la gloire de son mari, se voir jalousée par toutes
les femmes, fut pour Augustine une nouvelle moisson de plaisirs; mais
ce fut le dernier reflet que devait jeter son bonheur conjugal. Elle
commença par offenser la vanité de son mari, quand, malgré de vains
efforts, elle laissa percer son ignorance, l'impropriété de son langage
et l'étroitesse de ses idées. Le caractère de Sommervieux, dompté
pendant près de deux ans et demi par les premiers emportements de
l'amour, reprit, avec la tranquillité d'une possession moins jeune, sa
pente et ses habitudes un moment détournées de leur cours. La poésie, la
peinture et les exquises jouissances de l'imagination possèdent sur les
esprits élevés des droits imprescriptibles. Ces besoins d'une âme forte
n'avaient pas été trompés chez Théodore pendant ces deux années, ils
avaient trouvé seulement une pâture nouvelle. Quand les champs de
l'amour furent parcourus, quand l'artiste eut, comme les enfants,
cueilli des roses et des bluets avec une telle avidité qu'il ne
s'apercevait pas que ses mains ne pouvaient plus les tenir, la scène
changea. Si le peintre montrait à sa femme les croquis de ses plus
belles compositions, il l'entendait s'écrier comme eût fait le père
Guillaume:--C'est bien joli! son admiration sans chaleur ne provenait
pas d'un sentiment consciencieux, mais de la croyance sur parole de
l'amour. Augustine préférait un regard au plus beau tableau. Le seul
sublime qu'elle connût était celui du coeur. Enfin, Théodore ne put se
refuser à l'évidence d'une vérité cruelle: sa femme n'était pas sensible
à la poésie, elle n'habitait pas sa sphère, elle ne le suivait pas dans
tous ses caprices, dans ses improvisations, dans ses joies, dans ses
douleurs; elle marchait terre à terre dans le monde réel, tandis qu'il
avait la tête dans les cieux. Les esprits ordinaires ne peuvent pas
apprécier les souffrances renaissantes de l'être qui, uni à un autre par
le plus intime de tous les sentiments, est obligé de refouler sans cesse
les plus chères expansions de sa pensée, et de faire rentrer dans le
néant les images qu'une puissance magique le force à créer. Pour lui, ce
supplice est d'autant plus cruel, que le sentiment qu'il porte à son
compagnon ordonne, par sa première loi, de ne jamais rien se dérober
l'un à l'autre, et de confondre les effusions de la pensée aussi bien
que les épanchements de l'âme. On ne trompe pas impunément les volontés
de la nature: elle est inexorable comme la Nécessité, qui, certes, est
une sorte de nature sociale. Sommervieux se réfugia dans le calme et le
silence de son atelier, en espérant que l'habitude de vivre avec des
artistes pourrait former sa femme, et développerait en elle les germes
de haute intelligence engourdis que quelques esprits supérieurs croient
préexistants chez tous les êtres; mais Augustine était trop sincèrement
religieuse pour ne pas être effrayée du ton des artistes. Au premier
dîner que donna Théodore, elle entendit un jeune peintre disant avec
cette enfantine légèreté qu'elle ne sut pas reconnaître et qui absout
une plaisanterie de toute irréligion:--Mais, madame, votre paradis n'est
pas plus beau que la Transfiguration de Raphaël? Eh! bien, je me suis
lassé de la regarder. Augustine apporta donc dans cette société
spirituelle un esprit de défiance qui n'échappait à personne. Elle gêna.
Les artistes gênés sont impitoyables: ils fuient ou se moquent. Madame
Guillaume avait, entre autres ridicules, celui d'outrer la dignité qui
lui semblait l'apanage d'une femme mariée; et quoiqu'elle s'en fût
souvent moqué, Augustine ne sut pas se défendre d'une légère imitation
de la pruderie maternelle. Cette exagération de pudeur, que n'évitent
pas toujours les femmes vertueuses, suggéra quelques épigrammes à coups
de crayon dont l'innocent badinage était de trop bon goût pour que
Sommervieux pût s'en fâcher. Ces plaisanteries eussent été même plus
cruelles, elles n'étaient après tout que des représailles exercées sur
lui par ses amis. Mais rien ne pouvait être léger pour une âme qui
recevait aussi facilement que celle de Théodore des impressions
étrangères. Aussi éprouva-t-il insensiblement une froideur qui ne
pouvait aller qu'en croissant. Pour arriver au bonheur conjugal, il faut
gravir une montagne dont l'étroit plateau est bien près d'un revers
aussi rapide que glissant, et l'amour du peintre le descendait. Il jugea
sa femme incapable d'apprécier les considérations morales qui
justifiaient, à ses propres yeux, la singularité de ses manières envers
elle, et se crut fort innocent en lui cachant des pensées qu'il ne
comprenait pas et des écarts peu justiciables au tribunal d'une
conscience bourgeoise. Augustine se renferma dans une douleur morne et
silencieuse. Ces sentiments secrets mirent entre les deux époux un voile
qui devait s'épaissir de jour en jour. Sans que son mari manquât
d'égards envers elle, Augustine ne pouvait s'empêcher de trembler en le
voyant réserver pour le monde les trésors d'esprit et de grâce qu'il
venait jadis mettre à ses pieds. Bientôt, elle interpréta fatalement les
discours spirituels qui se tiennent dans le monde sur l'inconstance des
hommes. Elle ne se plaignit pas, mais son attitude équivalait à des
reproches. Trois ans après son mariage, cette femme jeune et jolie qui
passait si brillante dans son brillant équipage, qui vivait dans une
sphère de gloire et de richesse enviée de tant de gens insouciants et
incapables d'apprécier justement les situations de la vie, fut en proie
à de violents chagrins. Ses couleurs pâlirent. Elle réfléchit, elle
compara; puis, le malheur lui déroula les premiers textes de
l'expérience. Elle résolut de rester courageusement dans le cercle de
ses devoirs, en espérant que cette conduite généreuse lui ferait
recouvrer tôt ou tard l'amour de son mari; mais il n'en fut pas ainsi.
Quand Sommervieux, fatigué de travail, sortait de son atelier, Augustine
ne cachait pas si promptement son ouvrage, que le peintre ne pût
apercevoir sa femme raccommodant avec toute la minutie d'une bonne
ménagère le linge de la maison et le sien. Elle fournissait, avec
générosité, sans murmure, l'argent nécessaire aux prodigalités de son
mari; mais, dans le désir de conserver la fortune de son cher Théodore,
elle se montrait économe soit pour elle, soit dans certains détails de
l'administration domestique. Cette conduite est incompatible avec le
laisser-aller des artistes qui, sur la fin de leur carrière, ont tant
joui de la vie, qu'ils ne se demandent jamais la raison de leur ruine.
Il est inutile de marquer chacune des dégradations de couleur par
lesquelles la teinte brillante de leur lune de miel atteignit à une
profonde obscurité. Un soir, la triste Augustine, qui depuis longtemps
entendait son mari parler avec enthousiasme de madame la duchesse de
Carigliano, reçut d'une amie quelques avis méchamment charitables sur la
nature de l'attachement qu'avait conçu Sommervieux pour cette célèbre
coquette qui donnait le ton à la cour impériale. A vingt et un ans, dans
tout l'éclat de la jeunesse et de la beauté, Augustine se vit trahie
pour une femme de trente-six ans. En se sentant malheureuse au milieu du
monde et de ses fêtes désertes pour elle, la pauvre petite ne comprit
plus rien à l'admiration qu'elle y excitait, ni à l'envie qu'elle
inspirait. Sa figure prit une nouvelle expression. La mélancolie versa
dans ses traits la douceur de la résignation et la pâleur d'un amour
dédaigné. Elle ne tarda pas à être courtisée par les hommes les plus
séduisants; mais elle resta solitaire et vertueuse. Quelques paroles de
dédain, échappées à son mari, lui donnèrent un incroyable désespoir. Une
lueur fatale lui fit entrevoir les défauts de contact qui, par suite des
mesquineries de son éducation, empêchaient l'union complète de son âme
avec celle de Théodore: elle eut assez d'amour pour l'absoudre et pour
se condamner. Elle pleura des larmes de sang, et reconnut trop tard
qu'il est des mésalliances d'esprits aussi bien que des mésalliances de
moeurs et de rang. En songeant aux délices printanières de son union,
elle comprit l'étendue du bonheur passé, et convint en elle-même qu'une
si riche moisson d'amour était une vie entière qui ne pouvait se payer
que par du malheur. Cependant elle aimait trop sincèrement pour perdre
toute espérance. Aussi osa-t-elle entreprendre à vingt et un ans de
s'instruire et de rendre son imagination au moins digne de celle qu'elle
admirait.
--Si je ne suis pas poëte, se disait-elle, au moins je comprendrai la
poésie.
Et déployant alors cette force de volonté, cette énergie que les femmes
possèdent toutes quand elles aiment, madame de Sommervieux tenta de
changer son caractère, ses moeurs et ses habitudes; mais en dévorant des
volumes, en apprenant avec courage, elle ne réussit qu'à devenir moins
ignorante. La légèreté de l'esprit et les grâces de la conversation sont
un don de la nature ou le fruit d'une éducation commencée au berceau.
Elle pouvait apprécier la musique, en jouir, mais non chanter avec goût.
Elle comprit la littérature et les beautés de la poésie, mais il était
trop tard pour en orner sa rebelle mémoire. Elle entendait avec plaisir
les entretiens du monde, mais elle n'y fournissait rien de brillant. Ses
idées religieuses et ses préjugés d'enfance s'opposèrent à la complète
émancipation de son intelligence. Enfin, il s'était glissé contre elle,
dans l'âme de Théodore, une prévention qu'elle ne put vaincre. L'artiste
se moquait de ceux qui lui vantaient sa femme, et ses plaisanteries
étaient assez fondées: il imposait tellement à cette jeune et touchante
créature, qu'en sa présence, ou en tête-à-tête, elle tremblait.
Embarrassée par son trop grand désir de plaire, elle sentait son esprit
et ses connaissances s'évanouir dans un seul sentiment. La fidélité
d'Augustine déplut même à cet infidèle mari, qui semblait l'engager à
commettre des fautes en taxant sa vertu d'insensibilité. Augustine
s'efforça en vain d'abdiquer sa raison, de se plier aux caprices, aux
fantaisies de son mari, et de se vouer à l'égoïsme de sa vanité; elle ne
recueillit pas le fruit de ses sacrifices. Peut-être avaient-ils tous
deux laissé passer le moment où les âmes peuvent se comprendre. Un jour
le coeur trop sensible de la jeune épouse reçut un de ces coups qui font
si fortement plier les liens du sentiment, qu'on peut les croire
rompus. Elle s'isola. Mais bientôt une fatale pensée lui suggéra d'aller
chercher des consolations et des conseils au sein de sa famille.
Un matin donc, elle se dirigea vers la grotesque façade de l'humble et
silencieuse maison où s'était écoulée son enfance. Elle soupira en
revoyant cette croisée d'où, un jour, elle avait envoyé un premier
baiser à celui qui répandait aujourd'hui sur sa vie autant de gloire que
de malheur. Rien n'était changé dans l'antre où se rajeunissait
cependant le commerce de la draperie. La soeur d'Augustine occupait au
comptoir antique la place de sa mère. La jeune affligée rencontra son
beau-frère la plume derrière l'oreille. Elle fut à peine écoutée, tant
il avait l'air affairé. Les redoutables signaux d'un inventaire général
se faisaient autour de lui. Aussi la quitta-t-il en la priant d'excuser.
Elle fut reçue assez froidement par sa soeur, qui lui manifesta quelque
rancune. En effet, Augustine, brillante et descendant d'un joli
équipage, n'était jamais venue voir sa soeur qu'en passant. La femme du
prudent Lebas s'imagina que l'argent était la cause première de cette
visite matinale, elle essaya de se maintenir sur un ton de réserve qui
fit sourire plus d'une fois Augustine. La femme du peintre vit que, sauf
les barbes au bonnet, sa mère avait trouvé dans Virginie un successeur
qui conservait l'antique honneur du Chat-qui-pelote. Au déjeuner, elle
aperçut dans le régime de la maison, certains changements qui faisaient
honneur au bon sens de Joseph Lebas: les commis ne se levèrent pas au
dessert, on leur laissait la faculté de parler, et l'abondance de la
table annonçait une aisance sans luxe. La jeune élégante trouva les
coupons d'une loge aux Français où elle se souvint d'avoir vu sa soeur
de loin en loin. Madame Lebas avait sur les épaules un cachemire dont la
magnificence attestait la générosité avec laquelle son mari s'occupait
d'elle. Enfin, les deux époux marchaient avec leur siècle. Augustine fut
bientôt pénétrée d'attendrissement, en reconnaissant, pendant les deux
tiers de cette journée, le bonheur égal, sans exaltation, il est vrai,
mais aussi sans orages, que goûtait ce couple convenablement assorti.
Ils avaient accepté la vie comme une entreprise commerciale où il
s'agissait de faire, avant tout, honneur à ses affaires. La femme,
n'ayant pas rencontré dans son mari un amour excessif, s'était appliquée
à le faire naître. Insensiblement amené à estimer, à chérir Virginie, le
temps que le bonheur mit à éclore, fut, pour Joseph Lebas, et pour sa
femme un gage de durée. Aussi, lorsque la plaintive Augustine exposa sa
situation douloureuse, eut-elle à essuyer le déluge de lieux communs que
la morale de la rue Saint-Denis fournissait à sa soeur.
--Le mal est fait, ma femme, dit Joseph Lebas, il faut chercher à donner
de bons conseils à notre soeur. Puis, l'habile négociant analysa
lourdement les ressources que les lois et les moeurs pouvaient offrir à
Augustine pour sortir de cette crise; il en numérota pour ainsi dire les
considérations, les rangea par leur force dans des espèces de
catégories, comme s'il se fût agi de marchandises de diverses qualités;
puis il les mit en balance, les pesa, et conclut en développant la
nécessité où était sa belle-soeur de prendre un parti violent qui ne
satisfit point l'amour qu'elle ressentait encore pour son mari. Aussi ce
sentiment se réveilla-t-il dans toute sa force quand elle entendit
Joseph Lebas parlant de voies judiciaires. Elle remercia ses deux amis,
et revint chez elle encore plus indécise qu'elle ne l'était avant de les
avoir consultés. Elle hasarda de se rendre alors à l'antique hôtel de la
rue du Colombier, dans le dessein de confier ses malheurs à son père et
à sa mère. La pauvre petite femme ressemblait à ces malades qui, arrivés
à un état désespéré, essayent de toutes les recettes et se confient même
aux remèdes de bonne femme. Les deux vieillards la reçurent avec une
effusion de sentiment qui l'attendrit. Cette visite leur apportait une
distraction qui, pour eux, valait un trésor. Depuis quatre ans, ils
marchaient dans la vie comme des navigateurs sans but et sans boussole.
Assis au coin de leur feu, ils se racontaient l'un à l'autre tous les
désastres du Maximum, leurs anciennes acquisitions de draps, la manière
dont ils avaient évité les banqueroutes, et surtout cette célèbre
faillite Lecocq, la bataille de Marengo du père Guillaume. Puis, quand
ils avaient épuisé les vieux procès, ils récapitulaient les additions de
leurs inventaires les plus productifs, et se narraient encore les
vieilles histoires du quartier Saint-Denis. A deux heures, le père
Guillaume allait donner un coup d'oeil à l'établissement du
Chat-qui-pelote. En revenant il s'arrêtait à toutes les boutiques,
autrefois ses rivales, et dont les jeunes propriétaires espéraient
entraîner le vieux négociant dans quelque escompte aventureux, que,
selon sa coutume, il ne refusait jamais positivement. Deux bons chevaux
normands mouraient de gras-fondu dans l'écurie de l'hôtel; madame
Guillaume ne s'en servait que pour se faire traîner tous les dimanches
à la grand'messe de sa paroisse. Trois fois par semaine ce respectable
couple tenait table ouverte. Grâce à l'influence de son gendre
Sommervieux, le père Guillaume avait été nommé membre du comité
consultatif pour l'habillement des troupes. Depuis que son mari s'était
ainsi trouvé placé haut dans l'administration, madame Guillaume avait
pris la détermination de représenter. Leurs appartements étaient
encombrés de tant d'ornements d'or et d'argent, et de meubles sans goût
mais de valeur certaine, que la pièce la plus simple y ressemblait à une
chapelle. L'économie et la prodigalité semblaient se disputer dans
chacun des accessoires de cet hôtel. L'on eût dit que monsieur Guillaume
avait eu en vue de faire un placement d'argent jusque dans l'acquisition
d'un flambeau. Au milieu de ce bazar, dont la richesse accusait le
désoeuvrement des deux époux, le célèbre tableau de Sommervieux avait
obtenu la place d'honneur. Il faisait la consolation de monsieur et de
madame Guillaume qui tournaient vingt fois par jour les yeux harnachés
de bésicles vers cette image de leur ancienne existence, pour eux si
active et si amusante. L'aspect de cet hôtel et de ces appartements où
tout avait une senteur de vieillesse et de médiocrité, le spectacle
donné par ces deux êtres qui semblaient échoués sur un rocher d'or loin
du monde et des idées qui font vivre, surprirent Augustine. Elle
contemplait en ce moment la seconde partie du tableau dont le
commencement l'avait frappée chez Joseph Lebas, celui d'une vie agitée
quoique sans mouvement, espèce d'existence mécanique et instinctive
semblable à celle des castors. Elle eut alors je ne sais quel orgueil de
ses chagrins, en pensant qu'ils prenaient leur source dans un bonheur de
dix-huit mois qui valait à ses yeux mille existences comme celle dont le
vide lui semblait horrible. Cependant elle cacha ce sentiment peu
charitable, et déploya pour ses vieux parents, les grâces nouvelles de
son esprit, les coquetteries de tendresse que l'amour lui avait
révélées, et les disposa favorablement à écouter ses doléances
matrimoniales. Les vieilles gens ont un faible pour ces sortes de
confidences. Madame Guillaume voulut être instruite des plus légers
détails de cette vie étrange qui, pour elle, avait quelque chose de
fabuleux. Les voyages du baron de La Houtan, qu'elle commençait toujours
sans jamais les achever, ne lui apprirent rien de plus inouï sur les
sauvages du Canada.
--Comment, mon enfant, ton mari s'enferme avec des femmes nues, et tu as
la simplicité de croire qu'il les dessine?
A cette exclamation, la grand'mère posa ses lunettes sur une petite
travailleuse, secoua ses jupons et plaça ses mains jointes sur ses
genoux élevés par une chaufferette, son piédestal favori.
--Mais, ma mère, tous les peintres sont obligés d'avoir des modèles.
--Il s'est bien gardé de nous dire tout cela quand il t'a demandée en
mariage. Si je l'avais su, je n'aurais pas donné ma fille à un homme qui
fait un pareil métier. La religion défend ces horreurs-là, ça n'est pas
moral. A quelle heure nous disais-tu donc qu'il rentre chez lui?
--Mais à une heure, deux heures...
Les deux époux se regardèrent dans un profond étonnement.
--Il joue donc? dit monsieur Guillaume. Il n'y avait que les joueurs
qui, de mon temps, rentrassent si tard.
Augustine fit une petite moue qui repoussait cette accusation.
--Il doit te faire passer de cruelles nuits à l'attendre, reprit madame
Guillaume. Mais, non, tu te couches, n'est-ce pas? Et quand il a perdu,
le monstre te réveille.
--Non, ma mère, il est au contraire quelquefois très-gai. Assez souvent
même, quand il fait beau, il me propose de me lever pour aller dans les
bois.
--Dans les bois, à ces heures-là? Tu as donc un bien petit appartement
qu'il n'a pas assez de sa chambre, de ses salons, et qu'il lui faille
ainsi courir pour... Mais c'est pour t'enrhumer, que le scélérat te
propose ces parties-là. Il veut se débarrasser de toi. A-t-on jamais vu
un homme établi, qui a un commerce tranquille, galoper comme un
loup-garou?
--Mais, ma mère, vous ne comprenez donc pas que, pour développer son
talent, il a besoin d'exaltation. Il aime beaucoup les scènes qui...
--Ah! je lui en ferais de belles, des scènes, moi, s'écria madame
Guillaume en interrompant sa fille. Comment peux-tu garder des
ménagements avec un homme pareil? D'abord, je n'aime pas qu'il ne boive
que de l'eau. Ça n'est pas sain. Pourquoi montre-t-il de la répugnance à
voir les femmes quand elles mangent? Quel singulier genre! Mais c'est un
fou. Tout ce que tu nous en as dit n'est pas possible. Un homme ne peut
pas partir de sa maison sans souffler mot et ne revenir que dix jours
après. Il te dit qu'il a été à Dieppe pour peindre la mer. Est-ce qu'on
peint la mer? Il te fait des contes à dormir debout.
Augustine ouvrit la bouche pour défendre son mari; mais madame Guillaume
lui imposa silence par un geste de main auquel un reste d'habitude la
fit obéir, et sa mère s'écria d'un ton sec:--Tiens, ne me parle pas de
cet homme-là! il n'a jamais mis le pied dans une église que pour te voir
et t'épouser. Les gens sans religion sont capables de tout. Est-ce que
Guillaume s'est jamais avisé de me cacher quelque chose, de rester des
trois jours sans me dire ouf, et de babiller ensuite comme une pie
borgne?
--Ma chère mère, vous jugez trop sévèrement les gens supérieurs. S'ils
avaient des idées semblables à celles des autres, ce ne seraient plus
des gens à talent.
--Eh bien! que les gens à talent restent chez eux et ne se marient pas.
Comment! un homme à talent rendra sa femme malheureuse! et parce qu'il a
du talent ce sera bien? Talent, talent! Il n'y a pas tant de talent à
dire comme lui blanc et noir à toute minute, à couper la parole aux
gens, à battre du tambour chez soi, à ne jamais vous laisser savoir sur
quel pied danser, à forcer une femme de ne pas s'amuser avant que les
idées de monsieur ne soient gaies; d'être triste, dès qu'il est triste.
--Mais, ma mère, le propre de ces imaginations-là...
--Qu'est-ce que c'est que ces imaginations-là? reprit madame Guillaume
en interrompant encore sa fille. Il en a de belles, ma foi! Qu'est-ce
qu'un homme auquel il prend tout à coup, sans consulter de médecin, la
fantaisie de ne manger que des légumes? Encore, si c'était par religion,
sa diète lui servirait à quelque chose; mais il n'en a pas plus qu'un
huguenot. A-t-on jamais vu un homme aimer, comme lui, les chevaux plus
qu'il n'aime son prochain, se faire friser les cheveux comme un païen,
coucher des statues sous de la mousseline, faire fermer ses fenêtres le
jour pour travailler à la lampe? Tiens, laisse-moi, s'il n'était pas si
grossièrement immoral, il serait bon à mettre aux Petites-Maisons.
Consulte monsieur Loraux, le vicaire de Saint-Sulpice, demande-lui son
avis sur tout cela, il te dira que ton mari ne se conduit pas comme un
chrétien...
--Oh! ma mère! pouvez-vous croire...
--Oui, je le crois! Tu l'as aimé, tu n'aperçois rien de ces choses-là.
Mais, moi, vers les premiers temps de son mariage, je me souviens de
l'avoir rencontré dans les Champs-Élysées. Il était à cheval. Eh bien!
il galopait par moment ventre à terre, et puis il s'arrêtait pour aller
pas à pas. Je me suis dit alors:--Voilà un homme qui n'a pas de
jugement.
--Ah! s'écria monsieur Guillaume en se frottant les mains, comme j'ai
bien fait de t'avoir mariée séparée de biens avec cet original-là!
Quand Augustine eut l'imprudence de raconter les griefs véritables
qu'elle avait à exposer contre son mari, les deux vieillards restèrent
muets d'indignation. Le mot de divorce fut bientôt prononcé par madame
Guillaume. Au mot de divorce, l'inactif négociant fut comme réveillé.
Stimulé par l'amour qu'il avait pour sa fille, et aussi par l'agitation
qu'un procès allait donner à sa vie sans événements, le père Guillaume
prit la parole. Il se mit à la tête de la demande en divorce, la
dirigea, plaida presque, il offrit à sa fille de se charger de tous les
frais, de voir les juges, les avoués, les avocats, de remuer ciel et
terre. Madame de Sommervieux, effrayée, refusa les services de son père,
dit qu'elle ne voulait pas se séparer de son mari, dût-elle être dix
fois plus malheureuse encore, et ne parla plus de ses chagrins. Après
avoir été accablée par ses parents de tous ces petits soins muets et
consolateurs par lesquels les deux vieillards essayèrent de la
dédommager, mais en vain, de ses peines de coeur, Augustine se retira en
sentant l'impossibilité de parvenir à faire bien juger les hommes
supérieurs par des esprits faibles. Elle apprit qu'une femme devait
cacher à tout le monde, même à ses parents, des malheurs pour lesquels
on rencontre si difficilement des sympathies. Les orages et les
souffrances des sphères élevées ne peuvent être appréciés que par les
nobles esprits qui les habitent. En toute chose, nous ne pouvons être
jugés que par nos pairs.
La pauvre Augustine se retrouva donc dans la froide atmosphère de son
ménage, livrée à l'horreur de ses méditations. L'étude n'était plus rien
pour elle, puisque l'étude ne lui avait pas rendu le coeur de son mari.
Initiée aux secrets de ces âmes de feu mais privée de leurs ressources,
elle participait avec force à leurs peines sans partager leurs plaisirs.
Elle s'était dégoûtée du monde, qui lui semblait mesquin et petit devant
les événements des passions. Enfin, sa vie était manquée. Un soir, elle
fut frappée d'une pensée qui vint illuminer ses ténébreux chagrins
comme un rayon céleste. Cette idée ne pouvait sourire qu'à un coeur
aussi pur, aussi vertueux que l'était le sien. Elle résolut d'aller chez
la duchesse de Carigliano, non pas pour lui redemander le coeur de son
mari, mais pour s'y instruire des artifices qui le lui avaient enlevé;
mais pour intéresser à la mère des enfants de son ami cette orgueilleuse
femme du monde; mais pour la fléchir et la rendre complice de son
bonheur à venir comme elle était l'instrument de son malheur présent.
Un jour donc, la timide Augustine, armée d'un courage surnaturel, monta
en voiture, à deux heures après midi, pour essayer de pénétrer jusqu'au
boudoir de la célèbre coquette, qui n'était jamais visible avant cette
heure-là. Madame de Sommervieux ne connaissait pas encore les antiques
et somptueux hôtels du faubourg Saint-Germain. Quand elle parcourut ces
vestibules majestueux, ces escaliers grandioses, ces salons immenses
ornés de fleurs malgré les rigueurs de l'hiver, et décorés avec ce goût
particulier aux femmes qui sont nées dans l'opulence ou avec les
habitudes distinguées de l'aristocratie, Augustine eut un affreux
serrement de coeur. Elle envia les secrets de cette élégance de laquelle
elle n'avait jamais eu l'idée. Elle respira un air de grandeur qui lui
expliqua l'attrait de cette maison pour son mari. Quand elle parvint aux
petits appartements de la duchesse, elle éprouva de la jalousie et une
sorte de désespoir, en y admirant la voluptueuse disposition des
meubles, des draperies et des étoffes tendues. Là le désordre était une
grâce, là le luxe affectait une espèce de dédain pour la richesse. Les
parfums répandus dans cette douce atmosphère flattaient l'odorat sans
l'offenser. Les accessoires de l'appartement s'harmoniaient avec une vue
ménagée par des glaces sans tain sur les pelouses d'un jardin planté
d'arbres verts. Tout était séduction, et le calcul ne s'y sentait point.
Le génie de la maîtresse de ces appartements respirait tout entier dans
le salon où attendait Augustine. Elle tâcha d'y deviner le caractère de
sa rivale par l'aspect des objets épars; mais il y avait là quelque
chose d'impénétrable dans le désordre comme dans la symétrie, et pour la
simple Augustine ce fut lettres closes. Tout ce qu'elle y put voir,
c'est que la duchesse était une femme supérieure en tant que femme. Elle
eut alors une pensée douloureuse.
--Hélas! serait-il vrai, se dit-elle, qu'un coeur aimant et simple ne
suffit pas à un artiste; et pour balancer le poids de ces âmes fortes,
faut-il les unir à des âmes féminines dont la puissance soit pareille à
la leur? Si j'avais été élevée comme cette sirène, au moins nos armes
eussent été égales au moment de la lutte.
--Mais je n'y suis pas! Ces mots secs et brefs, quoique prononcés à voix
basse dans le boudoir voisin, furent entendus par Augustine, dont le
coeur palpita.
--Cette dame est là, répliqua la femme de chambre.
--Vous êtes folle, faites donc entrer! répondit la duchesse dont la voix
devenue douce avait pris l'accent affectueux de la politesse.
Évidemment, elle désirait alors être entendue.
Augustine s'avança timidement. Au fond de ce frais boudoir elle vit la
duchesse voluptueusement couchée sur une ottomane en velours vert placée
au centre d'une espèce de demi-cercle dessiné par les plis moelleux
d'une mousseline tendue sur un fond jaune. Des ornements de bronze doré,
disposés avec un goût exquis, rehaussaient encore cette espèce de dais
sous lequel la duchesse était posée comme une statue antique. La couleur
foncée du velours ne lui laissait perdre aucun moyen de séduction. Un
demi-jour, ami de sa beauté, semblait être plutôt un reflet qu'une
lumière. Quelques fleurs rares élevaient leurs têtes embaumées au-dessus
des vases de Sèvres les plus riches. Au moment où ce tableau s'offrit
aux yeux d'Augustine étonnée, elle avait marché si doucement, qu'elle
put surprendre un regard de l'enchanteresse. Ce regard semblait dire à
une personne que la femme du peintre n'aperçut pas d'abord:--Restez,
vous allez voir une jolie femme, et vous me rendrez sa visite moins
ennuyeuse.
A l'aspect d'Augustine, la duchesse se leva et la fit asseoir auprès
d'elle.
--A quoi dois-je le bonheur de cette visite, madame? dit-elle avec un
sourire plein de grâces.
--Pourquoi tant de fausseté? pensa Augustine qui ne répondit que par une
inclination de tête.
Ce silence était commandé. La jeune femme voyait devant elle un témoin
de trop à cette scène. Ce personnage était, de tous les colonels de
l'armée, le plus jeune, le plus élégant et le mieux fait. Son costume
demi-bourgeois faisait ressortir les grâces de sa personne. Sa figure
pleine de vie, de jeunesse, et déjà fort expressive, était encore
animée par de petites moustaches relevées en pointe et noires comme du
jais, par une impériale bien fournie, par des favoris soigneusement
peignés et par une forêt de cheveux noirs assez en désordre. Il badinait
avec une cravache, en manifestant une aisance et une liberté qui
séyaient à l'air satisfait de sa physionomie ainsi qu'à la recherche de
sa toilette. Les rubans attachés à sa boutonnière étaient noués avec
dédain, et il paraissait bien plus vain de sa jolie tournure que de son
courage. Augustine regarda la duchesse de Carigliano en lui montrant le
colonel par un coup d'oeil dont toutes les prières furent comprises.
--Eh bien, adieu, monsieur d'Aiglemont, nous nous retrouverons au bois
de Boulogne.
Ces mots furent prononcés par la sirène comme s'ils étaient le résultat
d'une stipulation antérieure à l'arrivée d'Augustine; elle les
accompagna d'un regard menaçant que l'officier méritait peut-être pour
l'admiration qu'il témoignait en contemplant la modeste fleur qui
contrastait si bien avec l'orgueilleuse duchesse. Le jeune fat s'inclina
en silence, tourna sur les talons de ses bottes, et s'élança
gracieusement hors du boudoir. En ce moment, Augustine, épiant sa rivale
qui semblait suivre des yeux le brillant officier, surprit dans ce
regard un sentiment dont les fugitives expressions sont connues de
toutes les femmes. Elle songea avec la douleur la plus profonde que sa
visite allait être inutile: cette artificieuse duchesse était trop avide
d'hommages pour ne pas avoir le coeur sans pitié.
--Madame, dit Augustine d'une voix entrecoupée, la démarche que je fais
en ce moment auprès de vous va vous sembler bien singulière; mais le
désespoir a sa folie, et doit faire tout excuser. Je m'explique trop
bien pourquoi Théodore préfère votre maison à toute autre, et pourquoi
votre esprit exerce tant d'empire sur lui. Hélas! je n'ai qu'à rentrer
en moi-même pour en trouver des raisons plus que suffisantes. Mais
j'adore mon mari, madame. Deux ans de larmes n'ont point effacé son
image de mon coeur, quoique j'aie perdu le sien. Dans ma folie, j'ai osé
concevoir l'idée de lutter avec vous; et je viens à vous, vous demander
par quels moyens je puis triompher de vous-même. Oh, madame! s'écria la
jeune femme en saisissant avec ardeur la main de sa rivale, qui la lui
laissa prendre, je ne prierai jamais Dieu pour mon propre bonheur avec
autant de ferveur que je l'implorerais pour le vôtre, si vous m'aidiez
à reconquérir, je ne dirai pas l'amour, mais la tendresse de
Sommervieux. Je n'ai plus d'espoir qu'en vous. Ah! dites-moi comment
vous avez pu lui plaire et lui faire oublier les premiers jours de...
A ces mots, Augustine, suffoquée par des sanglots mal contenus, fut
obligée de s'arrêter. Honteuse de sa faiblesse, elle cacha son visage
dans un mouchoir qu'elle inonda de ses larmes.
--Êtes-vous donc enfant, ma chère petite belle! dit la duchesse, qui,
séduite par la nouveauté de cette scène et attendrie malgré elle en
recevant l'hommage que lui rendait la plus parfaite vertu qui fût
peut-être à Paris, prit le mouchoir de la jeune femme et se mit à lui
essuyer elle-même les yeux en la flattant par quelques monosyllabes
murmurés avec une gracieuse pitié.
Après un moment de silence, la coquette, emprisonnant les jolies mains
de la pauvre Augustine entre les siennes qui avaient un rare caractère
de beauté noble et de puissance, lui dit d'une voix douce et
affectueuse:--Pour premier avis, je vous conseillerai de ne pas pleurer
ainsi, les larmes enlaidissent. Il faut savoir prendre son parti sur les
chagrins; ils rendent malade, et l'amour ne reste pas longtemps sur un
lit de douleur. La mélancolie donne bien d'abord une certaine grâce qui
plaît, mais elle finit par allonger les traits et flétrir la plus
ravissante de toutes les figures. Ensuite, nos tyrans ont l'amour-propre
de vouloir que leurs esclaves soient toujours gaies.
--Ah, madame! il ne dépend pas de moi de ne pas sentir! Comment peut-on,
sans éprouver mille morts, voir terne, décolorée, indifférente, une
figure qui jadis rayonnait d'amour et de joie? Ah! je ne sais pas
commander à mon coeur.
--Tant pis, chère belle; mais je crois déjà savoir toute votre histoire.
D'abord, imaginez-vous bien que si votre mari vous a été infidèle, je ne
suis pas sa complice. Si j'ai tenu à l'avoir dans mon salon, c'est, je
l'avouerai, par amour-propre: il était célèbre et n'allait nulle part.
Je vous aime déjà trop pour vous dire toutes les folies qu'il a faites
pour moi. Je ne vous en révèlerai qu'une seule, parce qu'elle nous
servira peut-être à vous le ramener et à le punir de l'audace qu'il met
dans ses procédés avec moi. Il finirait par me compromettre. Je connais
trop le monde, ma chère, pour vouloir me mettre à la discrétion d'un
homme trop supérieur. Sachez qu'il faut se laisser faire la cour par
eux, mais les épouser: c'est une faute. Nous autres femmes, nous devons
admirer les hommes de génie, en jouir comme d'un spectacle, mais vivre
avec eux! jamais. Fi donc! c'est vouloir prendre plaisir à regarder les
machines de l'Opéra, au lieu de rester dans une loge, à y savourer ses
brillantes illusions. Mais chez vous, ma pauvre enfant, le mal est
arrivé, n'est-ce pas? Eh bien! il faut essayer de vous armer contre la
tyrannie.
--Ah, madame! avant d'entrer ici, en vous y voyant, j'ai déjà reconnu
quelques artifices que je ne soupçonnais pas.
--Eh bien, venez me voir quelquefois, et vous ne serez pas long-temps
sans posséder la science de ces bagatelles, d'ailleurs assez
importantes. Les choses extérieures sont, pour les sots, la moitié de la
vie; et pour cela, plus d'un homme de talent se trouve un sot malgré
tout son esprit. Mais je gage que vous n'avez jamais rien su refuser à
Théodore?
--Le moyen, madame, de refuser quelque chose à celui qu'on aime!
--Pauvre innocente, je vous adorerais pour votre niaiserie. Sachez donc
que plus nous aimons, moins nous devons laisser apercevoir à un homme,
surtout à un mari, l'étendue de notre passion. C'est celui qui aime le
plus qui est tyrannisé, et, qui pis est, délaissé tôt ou tard. Celui qui
veut régner, doit...
--Comment, madame! faudra-t-il donc dissimuler, calculer, devenir
fausse, se faire un caractère artificiel et pour toujours? Oh! comment
peut-on vivre ainsi? Est-ce que vous pouvez...
Elle hésita, la duchesse sourit.
--Ma chère, reprit la grande dame d'une voix grave, le bonheur conjugal
a été de tout temps une spéculation, une affaire qui demande une
attention particulière. Si vous continuez à parler passion quand je vous
parle mariage, nous ne nous entendrons bientôt plus. Écoutez-moi,
continua-t-elle en prenant le ton d'une confidence. J'ai été à même de
voir quelques-uns des hommes supérieurs de notre époque. Ceux qui se
sont mariés ont, à quelques exceptions près, épousé des femmes nulles.
Eh bien! ces femmes-là les gouvernaient, comme l'empereur nous gouverne,
et étaient, sinon aimées, du moins respectées par eux. J'aime assez les
secrets, surtout ceux qui nous concernent, pour m'être amusée à chercher
le mot de cette énigme. Eh bien, mon ange! ces bonnes femmes avaient le
talent d'analyser le caractère de leurs maris. Sans s'épouvanter comme
vous de leurs supériorités, elles avaient adroitement remarqué les
qualités qui leur manquaient. Soit qu'elles possédassent ces qualités,
ou qu'elles feignissent de les avoir, elles trouvaient moyen d'en faire
un si grand étalage aux yeux de leurs maris qu'elles finissaient par
leur imposer. Enfin, apprenez encore que ces âmes qui paraissent si
grandes ont toutes un petit grain de folie que nous devons savoir
exploiter. En prenant la ferme volonté de les dominer, en ne s'écartant
jamais de ce but, en y rapportant toutes nos actions, nos idées, nos
coquetteries, nous maîtrisons ces esprits éminemment capricieux qui, par
la mobilité même de leurs pensées, nous donnent les moyens de les
influencer.
--Oh ciel! s'écria la jeune femme épouvantée, voilà donc la vie. C'est
un combat.....
--Où il faut toujours menacer, reprit la duchesse en riant. Notre
pouvoir est tout factice. Aussi ne faut-il jamais se laisser mépriser
par un homme; on ne se relève d'une pareille chute que par des
manoeuvres odieuses. Venez, ajouta-t-elle, je vais vous donner un moyen
de mettre votre mari à la chaîne.
Elle se leva, pour guider en souriant la jeune et innocente apprentie
des ruses conjugales à travers le dédale de son petit palais. Elles
arrivèrent toutes deux à un escalier dérobé qui communiquait aux
appartements de réception. Quand la duchesse tourna le secret de la
porte, elle s'arrêta, regarda Augustine avec un air inimitable de
finesse et de grâce:--Tenez, le duc de Carigliano m'adore! eh bien, il
n'ose pas entrer par cette porte sans ma permission. Et c'est un homme
qui a l'habitude de commander à des milliers de soldats. Il sait
affronter les batteries, mais devant moi! il a peur.
Augustine soupira. Elles parvinrent à une somptueuse galerie où la femme
du peintre fut amenée par la duchesse devant le portrait que Théodore
avait fait de mademoiselle Guillaume. A cet aspect, Augustine jeta un
cri.
--Je savais bien qu'il n'était plus chez moi, dit-elle, mais... ici!
--Ma chère, je ne l'ai exigé que pour voir jusqu'à quel degré de bêtise
un homme de génie peut atteindre. Tôt ou tard, il vous aurait été rendu
par moi; mais je ne m'attendais pas au plaisir de voir ici l'original
devant la copie. Pendant que nous allons achever notre conversation, je
le ferai porter dans votre voiture. Si, armée de ce talisman, vous
n'êtes pas maîtresse de votre mari pendant cent ans, vous n'êtes pas
une femme, et vous mériterez votre sort!
Augustine baisa la main de la duchesse, qui la pressa sur son coeur et
l'embrassa avec une tendresse d'autant plus vive qu'elle devait être
oubliée le lendemain. Cette scène aurait peut-être à jamais ruiné la
candeur et la pureté d'une femme moins vertueuse qu'Augustine, à qui les
secrets révélés par la duchesse pouvaient être également salutaires et
funestes. La politique astucieuse des hautes sphères sociales ne
convenait pas plus à Augustine que l'étroite raison de Joseph Lebas, ou
que la niaise morale de madame Guillaume. Étrange effet des fausses
positions où nous jettent les moindres contresens commis dans la vie!
Augustine ressemblait alors à un pâtre des Alpes surpris par une
avalanche: s'il hésite, ou s'il veut écouter les cris de ses compagnons,
le plus souvent il périt. Dans ces grandes crises, le coeur se brise ou
se bronze.
Madame de Sommervieux revint chez elle en proie à une agitation qu'il
serait difficile de décrire. Sa conversation avec la duchesse de
Carigliano éveillait une foule d'idées contradictoires dans son esprit.
Elle était comme les moutons de la fable, pleine de courage en l'absence
du loup. Elle se haranguait elle-même et se traçait d'admirables plans
de conduite; elle concevait mille stratagèmes de coquetterie; elle
parlait même à son mari, retrouvant, loin de lui, toutes les ressources
de cette éloquence vraie qui n'abandonne jamais les femmes; puis, en
songeant au regard fixe et clair de Théodore, elle tremblait déjà. Quand
elle demanda si monsieur était chez lui, la voix lui manqua. En
apprenant qu'il ne reviendrait pas dîner, elle éprouva un mouvement de
joie inexplicable. Semblable au criminel qui se pourvoit en cassation
contre son arrêt de mort, un délai, quelque court qu'il pût être, lui
semblait une vie entière. Elle plaça le portrait dans sa chambre, et
attendit son mari en se livrant à toutes les angoisses de l'espérance.
Elle pressentait trop bien que cette tentative allait décider de tout
son avenir, pour ne pas frissonner à toute espèce de bruit, même au
murmure de sa pendule qui semblait appesantir ses terreurs en les lui
mesurant. Elle tâcha de tromper le temps par mille artifices. Elle eut
l'idée de faire une toilette qui la rendit semblable en tout point au
portrait. Puis, connaissant le caractère inquiet de son mari, elle fit
éclairer son appartement d'une manière inusitée, certaine qu'en rentrant
la curiosité l'amènerait chez elle. Minuit sonna, quand, au cri du
jockei, la porte de l'hôtel s'ouvrit. La voiture du peintre roula sur le
pavé de la cour silencieuse.
--Que signifie cette illumination? demanda Théodore d'une voix joyeuse
en entrant dans la chambre de sa femme.
Augustine saisit avec adresse un moment si favorable, elle s'élança au
cou de son mari et lui montra le portrait. L'artiste resta immobile
comme un rocher. Ses yeux se dirigèrent alternativement sur Augustine et
sur la toile accusatrice. La timide épouse, demi-morte, épiait le front
changeant, le front terrible de son mari. Elle en vit par degrés les
rides expressives s'amonceler comme des nuages; puis, elle crut sentir
son sang se figer dans ses veines, quand, par un regard flamboyant et
d'une voix profondément sourde, elle fut interrogée.
--Où avez-vous trouvé ce tableau?
--La duchesse de Carigliano me l'a rendu.
--Vous le lui avez demandé?
--Je ne savais pas qu'il fût chez elle.
La douceur ou plutôt la mélodie enchanteresse de la voix de cet ange eût
attendri des Cannibales, mais non un artiste en proie aux tortures de la
vanité blessée.
--Cela est digne d'elle, s'écria l'artiste d'une voix tonnante. Je me
vengerai! dit-il en se promenant à grands pas. Elle en mourra de honte:
je la peindrai! oui, je la représenterai sous les traits de Messaline
sortant à la nuit du palais de Claude.
--Théodore! dit une voix mourante.
--Je la tuerai.
--Mon ami!
--Elle aime ce petit colonel de cavalerie, parce qu'il monte bien à
cheval...
--Théodore!
--Eh! laissez-moi, dit le peintre à sa femme avec un son de voix qui
ressemblait presque à un rugissement.
Il serait odieux de peindre toute cette scène à la fin de laquelle
l'ivresse de la colère suggéra à l'artiste des paroles et des actes
qu'une femme, moins jeune qu'Augustine, aurait attribués à la démence.
Sur les huit heures du matin, le lendemain, madame Guillaume surprit sa
fille pâle, les yeux rouges, la coiffure en désordre, tenant à la main
un mouchoir trempé de pleurs, contemplant sur le parquet les fragments
épars d'une toilette déchirée et les morceaux d'un grand cadre doré mis
en pièce. Augustine, que la douleur rendait presque insensible, montra
ces débris par un geste empreint de désespoir.
--Et voilà peut-être une grande perte, s'écria la vieille régente du
Chat-qui-pelote. Il était ressemblant, c'est vrai; mais j'ai appris
qu'il y a sur le boulevard un homme qui fait des portraits charmants
pour cinquante écus.
--Ah, ma mère!
--Pauvre petite, tu as bien raison! répondit madame Guillaume qui
méconnut l'expression du regard que lui jeta sa fille. Va, mon enfant,
l'on n'est jamais si tendrement aimé que par sa mère. Ma mignonne, je
devine tout; mais viens me confier tes chagrins, je te consolerai. Ne
t'ai-je pas déjà dit que cet homme-là était un fou! Ta femme de chambre
m'a conté de belles choses... Mais c'est donc un véritable monstre!
Augustine mit un doigt sur ses lèvres pâlies, comme pour implorer de sa
mère un moment de silence. Pendant cette terrible nuit, le malheur lui
avait fait trouver cette patiente résignation qui, chez les mères et
chez les femmes aimantes, surpasse, dans ses effets, l'énergie humaine
et révèle peut-être dans le coeur des femmes l'existence de certaines
cordes que Dieu a refusées à l'homme.
Une inscription gravée sur un cippe du cimetière Montmartre indiquait
que madame de Sommervieux était morte à vingt-sept ans. Un poëte, ami de
cette timide créature, voyait, dans les simples lignes de son épitaphe,
la dernière scène d'un drame. Chaque année, au jour solennel du 2
novembre, il ne passait jamais devant ce jeune marbre sans se demander
s'il ne fallait pas des femmes plus fortes que ne l'était Augustine pour
les puissantes étreintes du génie.
--Les humbles et modestes fleurs, écloses dans les vallées, meurent
peut-être, se disait-il, quand elles sont transplantées trop près des
cieux, aux régions où se forment les orages, où le soleil est brûlant.
  Maffliers; octobre 1829.

Invariable dans sa religion aristocratique, Monsieur DE FONTAINE en
avait aveuglément suivi les maximes.
(LE BAL DE SCEAUX.)]
LE BAL DE SCEAUX.
  A HENRI DE BALZAC,
  Son frère
  HONORÉ.
Le comte de Fontaine, chef de l'une des plus anciennes familles du
Poitou, avait servi la cause des Bourbons avec intelligence et courage
pendant la guerre que les Vendéens firent à la république. Après avoir
échappé à tous les dangers qui menacèrent les chefs royalistes durant
cette orageuse époque de l'histoire contemporaine, il disait
gaiement:--Je suis un de ceux qui se sont fait tuer sur les marches du
trône! Cette plaisanterie n'était pas sans quelque vérité pour un homme
laissé parmi les morts à la sanglante journée des Quatre-Chemins.
Quoique ruiné par des confiscations, ce fidèle Vendéen refusa
constamment les places lucratives que lui fit offrir l'empereur
Napoléon. Invariable dans sa religion aristocratique, il en avait
aveuglément suivi les maximes quand il jugea convenable de se choisir
une compagne. Malgré les séductions d'un riche parvenu révolutionnaire
qui mettait cette alliance à haut prix, il épousa une demoiselle de
Kergarouët sans fortune, mais dont la famille est une des plus vieilles
de la Bretagne.
La Restauration surprit monsieur de Fontaine chargé d'une nombreuse
famille. Quoiqu'il n'entrât pas dans les idées du généreux gentilhomme
de solliciter des grâces, il céda néanmoins aux désirs de sa femme,
quitta son domaine, dont le revenu modique suffisait à peine aux besoins
de ses enfants et vint à Paris. Contristé de l'avidité avec laquelle ses
anciens camarades faisaient curée des places et des dignités
constitutionnelles, il allait retourner à sa terre, lorsqu'il reçut une
lettre ministérielle, par laquelle une Excellence assez connue lui
annonçait sa nomination au grade de maréchal-de-camp, en vertu de
l'ordonnance qui permettait aux officiers des armées catholiques de
compter les vingt premières années inédites du règne de Louis XVIII
comme années de service. Quelques jours après, le Vendéen reçut encore,
sans aucune sollicitation et d'office, la croix de l'ordre de la
Légion-d'Honneur et celle de Saint-Louis. Ébranlé dans sa résolution par
ces grâces successives qu'il crut devoir au souvenir du monarque, il ne
se contenta plus de mener sa famille, comme il l'avait pieusement fait
chaque dimanche, crier Vive le Roi dans la salle des Maréchaux aux
Tuileries quand les princes se rendaient à la chapelle, il sollicita la
faveur d'une entrevue particulière. Cette audience, très-promptement
accordée, n'eut rien de particulier. Le salon royal était plein de vieux
serviteurs dont les têtes poudrées, vues d'une certaine hauteur,
ressemblaient à un tapis de neige. Là, le gentilhomme retrouva d'anciens
compagnons qui le reçurent d'un air un peu froid; mais les princes lui
parurent _adorables_, expression d'enthousiasme qui lui échappa, quand
le plus gracieux de ses maîtres, de qui le comte ne se croyait connu que
de nom, vint lui serrer la main et le proclama le plus pur des Vendéens.
Malgré cette ovation, aucune de ces augustes personnes n'eut l'idée de
lui demander le compte de ses pertes, ni celui de l'argent si
généreusement versé dans les caisses de l'armée catholique. Il s'aperçut
un peu tard, qu'il avait fait la guerre à ses dépens. Vers la fin de la
soirée, il crut pouvoir hasarder une spirituelle allusion à l'état de
ses affaires, semblable à celui de bien des gentilshommes. Sa Majesté se
prit à rire d'assez bon coeur, toute parole marquée au coin de l'esprit
avait le don de lui plaire; mais elle répliqua néanmoins par une de ces
royales plaisanteries dont la douceur est plus à craindre que la colère
d'une réprimande. Un des plus intimes confidents du roi ne tarda pas à
s'approcher du Vendéen calculateur, auquel il fit entendre, par une
phrase fine et polie, que le moment n'était pas encore venu de compter
avec les maîtres: il se trouvait sur le tapis des mémoires beaucoup plus
arriérés que le sien, et qui devaient sans doute servir à l'histoire de
la Révolution. Le comte sortit prudemment du groupe vénérable qui
décrivait un respectueux demi-cercle devant l'auguste famille. Puis,
après avoir, non sans peine, dégagé son épée parmi les jambes grêles où
elle s'était engagée, il regagna pédestrement à travers la cour des
Tuileries le fiacre qu'il avait laissé sur le quai. Avec cet esprit
rétif qui distingue la noblesse de vieille roche chez laquelle le
souvenir de la Ligue et des Barricades n'est pas encore éteint, il se
plaignit dans son fiacre, à haute voix et de manière à se compromettre,
sur le changement survenu à la cour.--Autrefois, se disait-il, chacun
parlait librement au roi de ses petites affaires, les seigneurs
pouvaient à leur aise lui demander des grâces et de l'argent, et
aujourd'hui l'on n'obtiendra pas, sans scandale, le remboursement des
sommes avancées pour son service? Morbleu! la croix de Saint-Louis et le
grade de maréchal-de-camp ne valent pas trois cent mille livres que
j'ai, bel et bien, dépensées pour la cause royale. Je veux reparler au
roi, en face, et dans son cabinet.
Cette scène refroidit d'autant plus le zèle de monsieur de Fontaine, que
ses demandes d'audience restèrent constamment sans réponse. Il vit
d'ailleurs les intrus de l'empire arrivant à quelques-unes des charges
réservées sous l'ancienne monarchie aux meilleures maisons.
--Tout est perdu, dit-il un matin. Décidément, le roi n'a jamais été
qu'un révolutionnaire. Sans Monsieur, qui ne déroge pas et console ses
fidèles serviteurs, je ne sais en quelles mains irait un jour la
couronne de France, si ce régime continuait. Leur maudit système
constitutionnel est le plus mauvais de tous les gouvernements, et ne
pourra jamais convenir à la France. Louis XVIII et M. Beugnot nous ont
tout gâté à Saint-Ouen.
Le comte désespéré se préparait à retourner à sa terre, en abandonnant
avec noblesse ses prétentions à toute indemnité. En ce moment, les
événements du Vingt Mars annoncèrent une nouvelle tempête qui menaçait
d'engloutir le roi légitime et ses défenseurs. Semblable à ces gens
généreux qui ne renvoient pas un serviteur par un temps de pluie,
monsieur de Fontaine emprunta sur sa terre pour suivre la monarchie en
déroute, sans savoir si cette complicité d'émigration lui serait plus
propice que ne l'avait été son dévouement passé; mais après avoir
observé que les compagnons de l'exil étaient plus en faveur que les
braves qui, jadis, avaient protesté, les armes à la main, contre
l'établissement de la république, peut-être espéra-t-il trouver dans ce
voyage à l'étranger plus de profit que dans un service actif et
périlleux à l'intérieur. Ses calculs de courtisan ne furent pas une de
ces vaines spéculations qui promettent sur le papier des résultats
superbes, et ruinent par leur exécution. Il fut donc, selon le mot du
plus spirituel et du plus habile de nos diplomates, un des cinq cents
fidèles serviteurs qui partagèrent l'exil de la cour à Gand, et l'un des
cinquante mille qui en revinrent.
Pendant cette courte absence de la royauté, monsieur de Fontaine eut le
bonheur d'être employé par Louis XVIII, et rencontra plus d'une occasion
de donner au roi les preuves d'une grande probité politique et d'un
attachement sincère. Un soir que le monarque n'avait rien de mieux à
faire, il se souvint du bon mot dit par monsieur de Fontaine aux
Tuileries. Le vieux Vendéen ne laissa pas échapper un tel à-propos, et
raconta son histoire assez spirituellement pour que ce roi, qui
n'oubliait rien, pût se la rappeler en temps utile. L'auguste
littérateur remarqua la tournure fine donnée à quelques notes dont la
rédaction avait été confiée au discret gentilhomme. Ce petit mérite
inscrivit monsieur de Fontaine, dans la mémoire du roi, parmi les plus
loyaux serviteurs de sa couronne. Au second retour, le comte fut un de
ces envoyés extraordinaires qui parcoururent les départements, avec la
mission de juger souverainement les fauteurs de la rébellion; mais il
usa modérément de son terrible pouvoir. Aussitôt que cette juridiction
temporaire eut cessé, le grand-prévôt s'assit dans un des fauteuils du
Conseil-d'État, devint député, parla peu, écouta beaucoup, et changea
considérablement d'opinion. Quelques circonstances, inconnues aux
biographes, le firent entrer assez avant dans l'intimité du prince, pour
qu'un jour le malicieux monarque l'interpellât ainsi en le voyant
entrer:
--Mon ami Fontaine, je ne m'aviserais pas de vous nommer
directeur-général ni ministre! Ni vous ni moi, si nous étions
_employés_, ne resterions en place, à cause de nos opinions. Le
gouvernement représentatif a cela de bon qu'il nous ôte la peine que
nous avions jadis, de renvoyer nous-mêmes nos secrétaires d'État. Notre
conseil est une véritable hôtellerie, où l'opinion publique nous envoie
souvent de singuliers voyageurs; mais enfin nous saurons toujours où
placer nos fidèles serviteurs.
Cette ouverture moqueuse fut suivie d'une ordonnance qui donnait à
monsieur de Fontaine une administration dans le domaine extraordinaire
de la Couronne. Par suite de l'intelligente attention avec laquelle il
écoutait les sarcasmes de son royal ami, son nom se trouva sur les
lèvres de Sa Majesté, toutes les fois qu'il fallut créer une commission
dont les membres devaient être lucrativement appointés. Il eut le bon
esprit de taire la faveur dont l'honorait le monarque et sut
l'entretenir par une manière piquante de narrer, dans une de ces
causeries familières auxquelles Louis XVIII se plaisait autant qu'aux
billets agréablement écrits, les anecdotes politiques et, s'il est
permis de se servir de cette expression, les cancans diplomatiques ou
parlementaires qui abondaient alors. On sait que les détails de sa
_gouvernementabilité_, mot adopté par l'auguste railleur, l'amusaient
infiniment. Grâce au bon sens, à l'esprit et à l'adresse de monsieur le
comte de Fontaine, chaque membre de sa nombreuse famille, quelque jeune
qu'il fût, finit, ainsi qu'il le disait plaisamment à son maître, par se
poser comme un ver-à-soie sur les feuilles du budget. Ainsi, par les
bontés du roi, l'aîné de ses fils parvint à une place éminente dans la
magistrature inamovible. Le second, simple capitaine avant la
restauration, obtint une légion immédiatement après son retour de Gand;
puis, à la faveur des mouvements de 1815 pendant lesquels on méconnut
les règlements, il passa dans la garde royale, repassa dans les
gardes-du-corps, revint dans la ligne, et se trouva lieutenant-général
avec un commandement dans la garde, après l'affaire du Trocadéro. Le
dernier, nommé sous-préfet, devint bientôt maître des requêtes et
directeur d'une administration municipale de la Ville de Paris, où il se
trouvait à l'abri des tempêtes législatives. Ces grâces sans éclat,
secrètes comme la faveur du comte, pleuvaient inaperçues. Quoique le
père et les trois fils eussent chacun assez de sinécures pour jouir d'un
revenu budgétaire presque aussi considérable que celui d'un
directeur-général, leur fortune politique n'excita l'envie de personne.
Dans ces temps de premier établissement du système constitutionnel, peu
de personnes avaient des idées justes sur les régions paisibles du
budget, où d'adroits favoris surent trouver l'équivalent des abbayes
détruites. Monsieur le comte de Fontaine, qui naguère encore se vantait
de n'avoir pas lu la Charte et se montrait si courroucé contre l'avidité
des courtisans, ne tarda pas à prouver à son auguste maître qu'il
comprenait aussi bien que lui l'esprit et les ressources du
_représentatif_. Cependant, malgré la sécurité des carrières ouvertes à
ses trois fils, malgré les avantages pécuniaires qui résultaient du
cumul de quatre places, monsieur de Fontaine se trouvait à la tête d'une
famille trop nombreuse pour pouvoir promptement et facilement rétablir
sa fortune. Ses trois fils étaient riches d'avenir, de faveur et de
talent; mais il avait trois filles, et craignait de lasser la bonté du
monarque. Il imagina de ne jamais lui parler que d'une seule de ces
vierges pressées d'allumer leur flambeau. Le roi avait trop bon goût
pour laisser son oeuvre imparfaite. Le mariage de la première avec un
receveur-général fut conclu par une de ces phrases royales qui ne
coûtent rien et valent des millions. Un soir où le monarque était
maussade, il sourit en apprenant l'existence d'une autre demoiselle de
Fontaine qu'il fit épouser à un jeune magistrat d'extraction bourgeoise,
il est vrai, mais riche, plein de talent, et qu'il créa baron. Lorsque,
l'année suivante, le Vendéen parla de Mademoiselle Émilie de Fontaine,
le roi lui répondit, de sa petite voix aigrelette:--_Amicus Plato, sed
magis amica Natio_. Puis, quelques jours après, il régala son _ami
Fontaine_ d'un quatrain assez innocent qu'il appelait une épigramme, et
dans lequel il le plaisantait sur ses trois filles si habilement
produites sous la forme d'une trinité. S'il faut en croire la chronique,
le monarque avait été chercher son bon mot dans l'unité des trois
personnes divines.
--Si le roi daignait changer son épigramme en épithalame? dit le comte
en essayant de faire tourner cette boutade à son profit.
--Si j'en vois la rime, je n'en vois pas la raison, répondit durement le
roi qui ne goûta point cette plaisanterie faite sur sa poésie quelque
douce qu'elle fût.
Dès ce jour, son commerce avec M. de Fontaine eut moins d'aménité. Les
rois aiment plus qu'on ne le croit la contradiction. Comme presque tous
les enfants venus les derniers, Émilie de Fontaine était un Benjamin
gâté par tout le monde. Le refroidissement du monarque causa donc
d'autant plus de peine au comte, que jamais mariage ne fut plus
difficile à conclure que celui de cette fille chérie. Pour concevoir
tous ces obstacles, il faut pénétrer dans l'enceinte du bel hôtel où
l'administrateur était logé aux dépens de la Liste-Civile. Émilie avait
passé son enfance à la terre de Fontaine en y jouissant de cette
abondance qui suffit aux premiers plaisirs de la jeunesse. Ses moindres
désirs y étaient des lois pour ses soeurs, pour ses frères, pour sa
mère, et même pour son père. Tous ses parents raffolaient d'elle.
Arrivée à l'âge de raison, précisément au moment où sa famille fut
comblée des faveurs de la fortune, l'enchantement de sa vie continua. Le
luxe de Paris lui sembla tout aussi naturel que la richesse en fleurs ou
en fruits, et que cette opulence champêtre qui firent le bonheur de ses
premières années. De même qu'elle n'avait éprouvé aucune contrariété
dans son enfance quand elle voulait satisfaire de joyeux désirs, de même
elle se vit encore obéie lorsqu'à l'âge de quatorze ans elle se lança
dans le tourbillon du monde. Accoutumée ainsi par degrés aux jouissances
de la fortune, les recherches de la toilette, l'élégance des salons
dorés et des équipages lui devinrent aussi nécessaires que les
compliments vrais ou faux de la flatterie, que les fêtes et les vanités
de la cour. Tout lui souriait d'ailleurs: elle aperçut pour elle de la
bienveillance dans tous les yeux. Comme la plupart des enfants gâtés,
elle tyrannisa ceux qui l'aimaient, et réserva ses coquetteries aux
indifférents. Ses défauts ne firent que grandir avec elle, et ses
parents allaient bientôt recueillir les fruits amers de cette éducation
funeste. Arrivée à l'âge de dix-neuf ans, Émilie de Fontaine n'avait pas
encore voulu faire de choix parmi les nombreux jeunes gens que la
politique de monsieur de Fontaine assemblait dans ses fêtes. Quoique
jeune encore, elle jouissait dans le monde de toute la liberté d'esprit
que peut y avoir une femme. Sa beauté était si remarquable que, pour
elle, paraître dans un salon, c'était y régner. Semblable aux rois, elle
n'avait pas d'amis, et se voyait partout l'objet d'une complaisance à
laquelle un naturel meilleur que le sien n'eût peut-être pas résisté.
Aucun homme, fût-ce même un vieillard, n'avait la force de contredire
les opinions d'une jeune fille dont un seul regard ranimait l'amour dans
un coeur froid. Élevée avec des soins qui manquèrent à ses soeurs, elle
peignait assez bien, parlait l'italien et l'anglais, jouait du piano
d'une façon désespérante; enfin sa voix, perfectionnée par les meilleurs
maîtres, avait un timbre qui donnait à son chant d'irrésistibles
séductions. Spirituelle et nourrie de toutes les littératures, elle
aurait pu faire croire que, comme dit Mascarille, les gens de qualité
viennent au monde en sachant tout. Elle raisonnait facilement sur la
peinture italienne ou flamande, sur le Moyen-âge ou la Renaissance;
jugeait à tort et à travers les livres anciens ou nouveaux, et faisait
ressortir avec une cruelle grâce d'esprit les défauts d'un ouvrage. La
plus simple de ses phrases était reçue par la foule idolâtre, comme par
les Turcs un _fetfa_ du sultan. Elle éblouissait ainsi les gens
superficiels; quant aux gens profonds, son tact naturel l'aidait à les
reconnaître; et pour eux, elle déployait tant de coquetterie, qu'à la
faveur de ses séductions, elle pouvait échapper à leur examen. Ce vernis
séduisant couvrait un coeur insouciant, l'opinion commune à beaucoup de
jeunes filles que personne n'habitait une sphère assez élevée pour
pouvoir comprendre l'excellence de son âme, et un orgueil qui s'appuyait
autant sur sa naissance que sur sa beauté. En l'absence du sentiment
violent qui ravage tôt ou tard le coeur d'une femme, elle portait sa
jeune ardeur dans un amour immodéré des distinctions, et témoignait le
plus profond mépris pour les roturiers. Fort impertinente avec la
nouvelle noblesse, elle faisait tous ses efforts pour que ses parents
marchassent de pair au milieu des familles les plus illustres du
faubourg Saint-Germain.
Ces sentiments n'avaient pas échappé à l'oeil observateur de monsieur de
Fontaine, qui plus d'une fois, lors du mariage de ses deux premières
filles, eut à gémir des sarcasmes et des bons mots d'Émilie. Les gens
logiques s'étonneront d'avoir vu le vieux Vendéen donnant sa première
fille à un receveur-général qui possédait bien, à la vérité, quelques
anciennes terres seigneuriales, mais dont le nom n'était pas précédé de
cette particule à laquelle le trône dut tant de défenseurs, et la
seconde à un magistrat trop récemment baronifié pour faire oublier que
le père avait vendu des fagots. Ce notable changement dans les idées du
noble, au moment où il atteignait sa soixantième année, époque à
laquelle les hommes quittent rarement leurs croyances, n'était pas dû
seulement à la déplorable habitation de la moderne Babylone où tous les
gens de province finissent par perdre leurs rudesses; la nouvelle
conscience politique du comte de Fontaine était encore le résultat des
conseils et de l'amitié du roi. Ce prince philosophe avait pris plaisir
à convertir le Vendéen aux idées qu'exigeaient la marche du dix-neuvième
siècle et la rénovation de la monarchie. Louis XVIII voulait fondre les
partis, comme Napoléon avait fondu les choses et les hommes. Le roi
légitime, peut-être aussi spirituel que son rival, agissait en sens
contraire. Le dernier chef de la maison de Bourbon était aussi empressé
à satisfaire le tiers-état et les gens de l'empire, en contenant le
clergé, que le premier des Napoléon fut jaloux d'attirer auprès de lui
les grands seigneurs ou de doter l'église. Confident des royales
pensées, le Conseiller d'État était insensiblement devenu l'un des
chefs les plus influents et les plus sages de ce parti modéré qui
désirait vivement, au nom de l'intérêt national, la fusion des opinions.
Il prêchait les coûteux principes du gouvernement constitutionnel et
secondait de toute sa puissance les jeux de la bascule politique qui
permettait à son maître de gouverner la France au milieu des agitations.
Peut-être monsieur de Fontaine se flattait-il d'arriver à la pairie par
un de ces coups de vent législatifs dont les effets si bizarres
surprenaient alors les plus vieux politiques. Un de ses principes les
plus fixes consistait à ne plus reconnaître en France d'autre noblesse
que la pairie, dont les familles étaient les seules qui eussent des
priviléges.
--Une noblesse sans priviléges, disait-il, est un manche sans outil.
Aussi éloigné du parti de Lafayette que du parti de La Bourdonnaye, il
entreprenait avec ardeur la réconciliation générale d'où devaient sortir
une ère nouvelle et de brillantes destinées pour la France. Il cherchait
à convaincre les familles chez lesquelles il avait accès, du peu de
chances favorables qu'offraient désormais la carrière militaire et
l'administration. Il engageait les mères à lancer leurs enfants dans les
professions indépendantes et industrielles, en leur donnant à entendre
que les emplois militaires et les hautes fonctions du gouvernement
finiraient par appartenir très-constitutionnellement aux cadets des
familles nobles de la pairie. Selon lui, la nation avait conquis une
part assez large dans l'administration par son assemblée élective, par
les places de la magistrature et par celles de la finance qui,
disait-il, seraient toujours comme autrefois l'apanage des notabilités
du tiers-état. Les nouvelles idées du chef de la famille de Fontaine, et
les sages alliances qui en résultèrent pour ses deux premières filles,
avaient rencontré de fortes résistances au sein de son ménage. La
comtesse de Fontaine resta fidèle aux vieilles croyances que ne devait
pas renier une femme qui appartenait aux Rohan par sa mère. Quoiqu'elle
se fût opposée pendant un moment au bonheur et à la fortune qui
attendaient ses deux filles aînées, elle se rendit à ces considérations
secrètes que les époux se confient le soir quand leurs têtes reposent
sur le même oreiller. Monsieur de Fontaine démontra froidement à sa
femme, par d'exacts calculs, que le séjour de Paris, l'obligation d'y
représenter, la splendeur de sa maison qui les dédommageait des
privations si courageusement partagées au fond de la Vendée, les
dépenses faites pour leurs fils absorbaient la plus grande partie de
leur revenu budgétaire. Il fallait donc saisir, comme une faveur
céleste, l'occasion qui se présentait pour eux d'établir si richement
leurs filles. Ne devaient-elles pas jouir un jour de soixante ou
quatre-vingt mille livres de rente? Des mariages si avantageux ne se
rencontraient pas tous les jours pour des filles sans dot. Enfin, il
était temps de penser à économiser pour augmenter la terre de Fontaine
et reconstruire l'antique fortune territoriale de la famille. La
comtesse céda, comme toutes les mères l'eussent fait à sa place, quoique
de meilleure grâce peut-être, à des arguments si persuasifs. Mais elle
déclara qu'au moins sa fille Émilie serait mariée de manière à
satisfaire l'orgueil qu'elle avait contribué malheureusement à
développer dans cette jeune âme.
Ainsi les événements qui auraient dû répandre la joie dans cette famille
y introduisirent un léger levain de discorde. Le receveur-général et le
jeune magistrat furent en butte aux froideurs d'un cérémonial que
surent créer la comtesse et sa fille Émilie. Leur étiquette trouva
bien plus amplement lieu d'exercer ses tyrannies domestiques: le
lieutenant-général épousa la fille unique d'un banquier; le président se
maria sensément avec une demoiselle dont le père, deux ou trois fois
millionnaire, avait fait le commerce des toiles peintes; enfin le
troisième frère se montra fidèle à ses doctrines roturières en prenant
sa femme dans la famille d'un riche notaire de Paris. Les trois
belles-soeurs, les deux beaux-frères trouvaient tant de charmes et
d'avantages personnels, à rester dans la haute sphère des puissances
politiques et à hanter les salons du faubourg Saint-Germain, qu'ils
s'accordèrent tous pour former une petite cour à la hautaine Émilie. Ce
pacte d'intérêt et d'orgueil ne fut cependant pas tellement bien cimenté
que la jeune souveraine n'excitât souvent des révolutions dans son petit
État. Des scènes, que le bon ton n'eût pas désavouées, entretenaient
entre tous les membres de cette puissante famille une humeur moqueuse
qui, sans altérer sensiblement l'amitié affichée en public, dégénérait
quelquefois dans l'intérieur en sentiments peu charitables. Ainsi la
femme du lieutenant-général, devenue baronne, se croyait tout aussi
noble qu'une Kergarouët, et prétendait que cent bonnes mille livres de
rente lui donnaient le droit d'être aussi impertinente que sa
belle-soeur Émilie à laquelle elle souhaitait parfois avec ironie un
mariage heureux, en annonçant que la fille de tel pair venait d'épouser
monsieur un tel, tout court. La femme du vicomte de Fontaine s'amusait à
éclipser Émilie par le bon goût et par la richesse qui se faisaient
remarquer dans ses toilettes, dans ses ameublements et ses équipages.
L'air moqueur avec lequel les belles-soeurs et les deux beaux-frères
accueillirent quelquefois les prétentions avouées par mademoiselle de
Fontaine excitait chez elle un courroux à peine calmé par une grêle
d'épigrammes. Lorsque le chef de la famille éprouva quelque
refroidissement dans la tacite et précaire amitié du monarque, il
trembla d'autant plus, que, par suite des défis railleurs de ses soeurs,
jamais sa fille chérie n'avait jeté ses vues si haut.
Au milieu de ces circonstances et au moment où cette petite lutte
domestique était devenue fort grave, le monarque, auprès duquel monsieur
de Fontaine croyait rentrer en grâce, fut attaqué de la maladie dont il
devait périr. Le grand politique qui sut si bien conduire sa nauf au
sein des orages ne tarda pas à succomber. Certain de la faveur à venir,
le comte de Fontaine fit donc les plus grands efforts pour rassembler
autour de sa dernière fille l'élite des jeunes gens à marier. Ceux qui
ont tâché de résoudre le problème difficile que présente l'établissement
d'une fille orgueilleuse et fantasque comprendront peut-être les peines
que se donna le pauvre Vendéen. Achevée au gré de son enfant chéri,
cette dernière entreprise eût couronné dignement la carrière que le
comte parcourait depuis dix ans à Paris. Par la manière dont sa famille
envahissait les traitements de tous les ministères, elle pouvait se
comparer à la maison d'Autriche, qui, par ses alliances, menace
d'envahir l'Europe. Aussi le vieux Vendéen ne se rebutait-il pas dans
ses présentations de prétendus, tant il avait à coeur le bonheur de sa
fille; mais rien n'était plus plaisant que la façon dont l'impertinente
créature prononçait ses arrêts et jugeait le mérite de ses adorateurs.
On eût dit que, semblable à l'une de ces princesses des Mille et un
Jours, Émilie fût assez riche, assez belle pour avoir le droit de
choisir parmi tous les princes du monde; ses objections étaient plus
bouffonnes les unes que les autres: l'un avait les jambes trop grosses
ou les genoux cagneux, l'autre était myope; celui-ci s'appelait Durand,
celui-là boitait; presque tous lui semblaient trop gras. Plus vive, plus
charmante, plus gaie que jamais après avoir rejeté deux ou trois
prétendus, elle s'élançait dans les fêtes de l'hiver et courait aux bals
où ses yeux perçants examinaient les célébrités du jour; où souvent, à
l'aide de son ravissant babil, elle parvenait à deviner les secrets du
coeur le plus mystérieux, où elle se plaisait à tourmenter tous les
jeunes gens, à exciter avec une coquetterie instinctive des demandes
qu'elle rejetait toujours.
La nature lui avait donné en profusion les avantages nécessaires au rôle
qu'elle jouait. Grande et svelte, Émilie de Fontaine possédait une
démarche imposante ou folâtre, à son gré. Son col un peu long lui
permettait de prendre de charmantes attitudes de dédain et
d'impertinence. Elle s'était fait un fécond répertoire de ces airs de
tête et de ces gestes féminins qui expliquent si cruellement ou si
heureusement les demi-mots et les sourires. De beaux cheveux noirs, des
sourcils très-fournis et fortement arqués prêtaient à sa physionomie une
expression de fierté que la coquetterie autant que son miroir lui
avaient appris à rendre terrible ou à tempérer par la fixité ou par la
douceur de son regard, par l'immobilité ou par les légères inflexions de
ses lèvres, par la froideur ou la grâce de son sourire. Quand Émilie
voulait s'emparer d'un coeur, sa voix pure ne manquait pas de mélodie;
mais elle pouvait aussi lui imprimer une sorte de clarté brève quand
elle entreprenait de paralyser la langue indiscrète d'un cavalier. Sa
figure blanche et son front de marbre étaient semblables à la surface
limpide d'un lac qui tour à tour se ride sous l'effort d'une brise ou
reprend sa sérénité joyeuse quand l'air se calme. Plus d'un jeune homme
en proie à ses dédains l'accusait de jouer la comédie; mais tant de feux
éclataient, tant de promesses jaillissaient de ses yeux noirs, qu'elle
se justifiait en faisant bondir le coeur de ses élégants danseurs sous
leurs fracs noirs. Parmi les jeunes filles à la mode, nulle mieux
qu'elle ne savait prendre un air de hauteur en recevant le salut d'un
homme qui n'avait que du talent, ou déployer cette politesse insultante
pour les personnes qu'elle regardait comme ses inférieures, et déverser
son impertinence sur tous ceux qui essayaient de marcher au pair avec
elle. Elle semblait, partout où elle se trouvait, recevoir plutôt des
hommages que des compliments; et même chez une princesse, sa tournure et
ses airs eussent converti le fauteuil sur lequel elle se serait assise,
en un trône impérial.
Monsieur de Fontaine découvrit trop tard combien l'éducation de la fille
qu'il aimait le plus avait été faussée par la tendresse de toute la
famille. L'admiration que le monde témoigne d'abord à une jeune
personne, mais de laquelle il ne tarde pas à se venger, avait encore
exalté l'orgueil d'Émilie et accru sa confiance en elle. Une
complaisance générale avait développé chez elle l'égoïsme naturel aux
enfants gâtés qui, semblables à des rois, s'amusent de tout ce qui les
approche. En ce moment, la grâce de la jeunesse et le charme des talents
cachaient à tous les yeux ces défauts, d'autant plus odieux chez une
femme qu'elle ne peut plaire que par le dévouement et par l'abnégation;
mais rien n'échappe à l'oeil d'un bon père: monsieur de Fontaine essaya
souvent d'expliquer à sa fille les principales pages du livre
énigmatique de la vie. Vaine entreprise! Il eut trop souvent à gémir sur
l'indocilité capricieuse et sur la sagesse ironique de sa fille pour
persévérer dans une tâche aussi difficile que celle de corriger un si
pernicieux naturel. Il se contenta de donner de temps en temps des
conseils pleins de douceur et de bonté; mais il avait la douleur de voir
ses plus tendres paroles glissant sur le coeur de sa fille comme s'il
eût été de marbre. Les yeux d'un père se dessillent si tard, qu'il
fallut au vieux Vendéen plus d'une épreuve pour s'apercevoir de l'air de
condescendance avec laquelle sa fille lui accordait de rares caresses.
Elle ressemblait à ces jeunes enfants qui paraissent dire à leur
mère:--Dépêche-toi de m'embrasser pour que j'aille jouer. Enfin, Émilie
daignait avoir de la tendresse pour ses parents. Mais souvent, par des
caprices soudains qui semblent inexplicables chez les jeunes filles,
elle s'isolait et ne se montrait plus que rarement; elle se plaignait
d'avoir à partager avec trop de monde le coeur de son père et de sa
mère, elle devenait jalouse de tout, même de ses frères et de ses
soeurs. Puis, après avoir pris bien de la peine à créer un désert autour
d'elle, cette fille bizarre accusait la nature entière de sa solitude
factice et de ses peines volontaires. Armée de son expérience de vingt
ans, elle condamnait le sort parce que, ne sachant pas que le premier
principe du bonheur est en nous, elle demandait aux choses de la vie de
le lui donner. Elle aurait fui au bout du globe pour éviter des mariages
semblables à ceux de ses deux soeurs; et néanmoins elle avait dans le
coeur une affreuse jalousie de les voir mariées, riches et heureuses.
Enfin, quelquefois elle donnait à penser à sa mère, victime de ses
procédés tout autant que monsieur de Fontaine, qu'elle avait un grain de
folie. Cette aberration était assez explicable: rien n'est plus commun
que cette secrète fierté née au coeur des jeunes personnes qui
appartiennent à des familles haut placées sur l'échelle sociale, et que
la nature a douées d'une grande beauté. Presque toutes sont persuadées
que leurs mères, arrivées à l'âge de quarante ou cinquante ans, ne
peuvent plus ni sympathiser avec leurs jeunes âmes, ni en concevoir les
fantaisies. Elles s'imaginent que la plupart des mères, jalouses de
leurs filles, veulent les habiller à leur mode dans le dessein prémédité
de les éclipser ou de leur ravir des hommages. De là, souvent, des
larmes secrètes ou de sourdes révoltes contre la prétendue tyrannie
maternelle. Au milieu de ces chagrins qui deviennent réels, quoique
assis sur une base imaginaire, elles ont encore la manie de composer un
thème pour leur existence, et se tirent à elles-mêmes un brillant
horoscope. Leur magie consiste à prendre leurs rêves pour des réalités.
Elles résolvent secrètement, dans leurs longues méditations, de
n'accorder leur coeur et leur main qu'à l'homme qui possédera tel ou tel
avantage. Elles dessinent dans leur imagination un type auquel il faut,
bon gré mal gré, que leur futur ressemble. Après avoir expérimenté la
vie et fait les réflexions sérieuses qu'amènent les années, à force de
voir le monde et son train prosaïque, à force d'exemples malheureux, les
belles couleurs de leur figure idéale s'abolissent; puis, elles se
trouvent un beau jour, dans le courant de la vie, tout étonnées d'être
heureuses sans la nuptiale poésie de leurs rêves. Suivant cette
poétique, mademoiselle Émilie de Fontaine avait arrêté, dans sa fragile
sagesse, un programme auquel devait se conformer son prétendu pour être
accepté. De là ses dédains et ses sarcasmes.
--Quoique jeune et de noblesse ancienne, s'était-elle dit, il sera pair
de France ou fils aîné d'un pair! Il me serait insupportable de ne pas
voir mes armes peintes sur les panneaux de ma voiture au milieu des plis
flottants d'un manteau d'azur, et de ne pas courir comme les princes
dans la grande allée des Champs-Élysées, les jours de Longchamp.
D'ailleurs, mon père prétend que ce sera un jour la plus belle dignité
de France. Je le veux militaire en me réservant de lui faire donner sa
démission, et je le veux décoré pour qu'on nous porte les armes.
Ces rares qualités ne servaient à rien, si cet être de raison ne
possédait pas encore une grande amabilité, une jolie tournure, de
l'esprit, et s'il n'était pas svelte. La maigreur, cette grâce du corps,
quelque fugitive qu'elle pût être, surtout dans un gouvernement
représentatif, était une clause de rigueur. Mademoiselle de Fontaine
avait une certaine mesure idéale qui lui servait de modèle. Le jeune
homme qui, au premier coup d'oeil, ne remplissait pas les conditions
voulues, n'obtenait même pas un second regard.
--Oh, mon Dieu! voyez combien ce monsieur est gras! était chez elle la
plus haute expression du mépris.
A l'entendre, les gens d'une honnête corpulence étaient incapables de
sentiments, mauvais maris et indignes d'entrer dans une société
civilisée. Quoique ce fût une beauté recherchée en Orient, l'embonpoint
lui semblait un malheur chez les femmes; mais chez un homme, c'était un
crime. Ces opinions paradoxales amusaient, grâce à une certaine gaieté
d'élocution. Néanmoins le comte sentit que plus tard les prétentions de
sa fille, dont le ridicule allait être visible pour certaines femmes
aussi clairvoyantes que peu charitables, deviendraient un fatal sujet de
raillerie. Il craignit que les idées bizarres de sa fille ne se
changeassent en mauvais ton. Il tremblait que le monde impitoyable ne se
moquât déjà d'une personne qui restait si longtemps en scène sans donner
un dénoûment à la comédie qu'elle y jouait. Plus d'un acteur, mécontent
d'un refus, paraissait attendre le moindre incident malheureux pour se
venger. Les indifférents, les oisifs commençaient à se lasser:
l'admiration est toujours une fatigue pour l'espèce humaine. Le vieux
Vendéen savait mieux que personne que s'il faut choisir avec art le
moment d'entrer sur les tréteaux du monde, sur ceux de la cour, dans un
salon ou sur la scène, il est encore plus difficile d'en sortir à
propos. Aussi, pendant le premier hiver qui suivit l'avénement de
Charles X au trône, redoubla-t-il d'efforts, conjointement avec ses
trois fils et ses gendres, pour réunir dans les salons de son hôtel les
meilleurs partis que Paris et les différentes députations des
départements pouvaient présenter. L'éclat de ses fêtes, le luxe de sa
salle à manger et ses dîners parfumés de truffes rivalisaient avec les
célèbres repas par lesquels les ministres du temps s'assuraient le vote
de leurs soldats parlementaires.
L'honorable Vendéen fut alors signalé comme un des plus puissants
corrupteurs de la probité législative de cette illustre chambre qui
sembla mourir d'indigestion. Chose bizarre! ses tentatives pour marier
sa fille le maintinrent dans une éclatante faveur. Peut-être trouva-t-il
quelque avantage secret à vendre deux fois ses truffes. Cette accusation
due à certains libéraux railleurs qui compensaient, par l'abondance de
leurs paroles, la rareté de leurs adhérents dans la chambre, n'eut
aucun succès. La conduite du gentilhomme poitevin était en général si
noble et si honorable, qu'il ne reçut pas une seule de ces épigrammes
par lesquelles les malins journaux de cette époque assaillirent les
trois cents votants du centre, les ministres, les cuisiniers, les
directeurs généraux, les princes de la fourchette et les défenseurs
d'office qui soutenaient l'administration-Villèle. A la fin de cette
campagne, pendant laquelle monsieur de Fontaine avait, à plusieurs
reprises, fait donner toutes ses troupes, il crut que son assemblée de
prétendus ne serait pas, cette fois, une fantasmagorie pour sa fille, et
qu'il était temps de la consulter. Il avait une certaine satisfaction
intérieure d'avoir bien rempli son devoir de père. Puis ayant fait
flèche de tout bois, il espérait que, parmi tant de coeurs offerts à la
capricieuse Émilie, il pouvait s'en rencontrer au moins un qu'elle eût
distingué. Incapable de renouveler cet effort, et d'ailleurs lassé de la
conduite de sa fille, vers la fin du carême, un matin que la séance de
la chambre ne réclamait pas trop impérieusement son vote, il résolut de
faire un coup d'autorité. Pendant qu'un valet de chambre dessinait
artistement sur son crâne jaune le delta de poudre qui complétait, avec
des ailes de pigeon pendantes, sa coiffure vénérable, le père d'Émilie
ordonna, non sans une secrète émotion, à son vieux valet de chambre
d'aller avertir l'orgueilleuse demoiselle de comparaître immédiatement
devant le chef de la famille.
--Joseph, lui dit-il au moment où il eut achevé sa coiffure, ôtez cette
serviette, tirez ces rideaux, mettez ces fauteuils en place, secouez le
tapis de la cheminée, essuyez partout. Allons! Donnez un peu d'air à mon
cabinet en ouvrant la fenêtre.
Le comte multipliait ses ordres, essoufflait Joseph, qui, devinant les
intentions de son maître, restitua quelque fraîcheur à cette pièce
naturellement la plus négligée de toute la maison, et réussit à imprimer
une sorte d'harmonie à des monceaux de comptes, aux cartons, aux livres,
aux meubles de ce sanctuaire où se débattaient les intérêts du domaine
royal. Quand Joseph eut achevé de mettre un peu d'ordre dans ce chaos et
de placer en évidence, comme dans un magasin de nouveautés, les choses
qui pouvaient être les plus agréables à voir, ou produire par leurs
couleurs une sorte de poésie bureaucratique, il s'arrêta au milieu du
dédale des paperasses étalées en quelques endroits jusque sur le tapis,
il s'admira lui-même un moment, hocha la tête et sortit.
Le pauvre sinécuriste ne partagea pas la bonne opinion de son serviteur.
Avant de s'asseoir dans son immense fauteuil à oreilles, il jeta un
regard de méfiance autour de lui, examina d'un air hostile sa robe de
chambre, en chassa quelques grains de tabac, s'essuya soigneusement le
nez, rangea les pelles et les pincettes, attisa le feu, releva les
quartiers de ses pantoufles, rejeta en arrière sa petite queue
horizontalement logée entre le col de son gilet et celui de sa robe de
chambre, et lui fit reprendre sa position perpendiculaire; puis, il
donna un coup de balai aux cendres d'un foyer qui attestait
l'obstination de son catarrhe. Enfin le vieux Vendéen ne s'assit
qu'après avoir repassé une dernière fois en revue son cabinet, en
espérant que rien n'y pourrait donner lieu aux remarques aussi
plaisantes qu'impertinentes par lesquelles sa fille avait coutume de
répondre à ses sages avis. En cette occurrence, il ne voulait pas
compromettre sa dignité paternelle. Il prit délicatement une prise de
tabac, et toussa deux ou trois fois comme s'il se disposait à demander
l'appel nominal: il entendait le pas léger de sa fille, qui entra en
fredonnant un air d'_il Barbiere_.
--Bonjour, mon père. Que me voulez-vous donc si matin?
Après ces paroles jetées comme la ritournelle de l'air qu'elle chantait,
elle embrassa le comte, non pas avec cette tendresse familière qui rend
le sentiment filial chose si douce, mais avec l'insouciante légèreté
d'une maîtresse sûre de toujours plaire quoi qu'elle fasse.
--Ma chère enfant, dit gravement monsieur de Fontaine, je t'ai fait
venir pour causer très-sérieusement avec toi, sur ton avenir. La
nécessité où tu es en ce moment de choisir un mari de manière à rendre
ton bonheur durable...
--Mon bon père, répondit Émilie en employant les sons les plus
caressants de sa voix pour l'interrompre, il me semble que l'armistice
que nous avons conclu relativement à mes prétendus n'est pas encore
expiré.
--Émilie, cessons aujourd'hui de badiner sur un sujet si important.
Depuis quelque temps les efforts de ceux qui t'aiment véritablement, ma
chère enfant, se réunissent pour te procurer un établissement
convenable, et ce serait être coupable d'ingratitude que d'accueillir
légèrement les marques d'intérêt que je ne suis pas seul à te prodiguer.
En entendant ces paroles et après avoir lancé un regard malicieusement
investigateur sur les meubles du cabinet paternel, la jeune fille alla
prendre celui des fauteuils qui paraissait avoir le moins servi aux
solliciteurs, l'apporta elle-même de l'autre côté de la cheminée, de
manière à se placer en face de son père, prit une attitude si grave
qu'il était impossible de n'y pas voir les traces d'une moquerie, et se
croisa les bras sur la riche garniture d'une pèlerine _à la neige_ dont
les nombreuses ruches de tulle furent impitoyablement froissées. Après
avoir regardé de côté, et en riant, la figure soucieuse de son vieux
père, elle rompit le silence.
--Je ne vous ai jamais entendu dire, mon cher père, que le gouvernement
fît ses communications en robe de chambre. Mais, ajouta-t-elle en
souriant, n'importe, le peuple ne doit pas être difficile. Voyons donc
vos projets de lois et vos présentations officielles.
--Je n'aurai pas toujours la facilité de vous en faire, jeune folle!
Écoute, Émilie. Mon intention n'est pas de compromettre plus longtemps
mon caractère, qui est une partie de la fortune de mes enfants, à
recruter ce régiment de danseurs que tu mets en déroute à chaque
printemps. Déjà tu as été la cause innocente de bien des brouilleries
dangereuses avec certaines familles. J'espère que tu comprendras mieux
aujourd'hui les difficultés de ta position et de la nôtre. Tu as vingt
ans, ma fille, et voici près de trois ans que tu devrais être mariée.
Tes frères, tes deux soeurs sont tous établis richement et heureusement.
Mais, mon enfant, les dépenses que nous ont suscitées ces mariages, et
le train de maison que tu fais tenir à ta mère, ont absorbé tellement
nos revenus, qu'à peine pourrai-je te donner cent mille francs de dot.
Dès aujourd'hui je veux m'occuper du sort à venir de ta mère, qui ne
doit pas être sacrifiée à ses enfants. Émilie, si je venais à manquer à
ma famille, madame de Fontaine ne saurait être à la merci de personne,
et doit continuer à jouir de l'aisance par laquelle j'ai récompensé trop
tard son dévouement à mes malheurs. Tu vois, mon enfant, que la
faiblesse de ta dot ne saurait être en harmonie avec tes idées de
grandeur. Encore sera-ce un sacrifice que je n'ai fait pour aucun autre
de mes enfants; mais ils se sont généreusement accordés à ne pas se
prévaloir un jour de l'avantage que nous ferons à un enfant trop chéri.
--Dans leur position! dit Émilie en agitant la tête avec ironie.
--Ma fille, ne dépréciez jamais ainsi ceux qui vous aiment. Sachez qu'il
n'y a que les pauvres de généreux! Les riches ont toujours
d'excellentes raisons pour ne pas abandonner vingt mille francs à un
parent. Eh bien! ne boude pas, mon enfant, et parlons raisonnablement.
Parmi les jeunes gens à marier, n'as-tu pas remarqué monsieur de
Manerville?
--Oh! il dit _zeu_ au lieu de jeu, il regarde toujours son pied parce
qu'il le croit petit, et il se mire! D'ailleurs, il est blond, je n'aime
pas les blonds.
--Eh bien! monsieur de Beaudenord?
--Il n'est pas noble. Il est mal fait et gros. A la vérité, il est brun.
Il faudrait que ces deux messieurs s'entendissent pour réunir leurs
fortunes, et que le premier donnât son corps et son nom au second qui
garderait ses cheveux, et alors... peut-être...
--Qu'as-tu à dire contre monsieur de Rastignac?
--Il est devenu presque banquier, dit-elle malicieusement.
--Et le vicomte de Portenduère, notre parent?
--Un enfant qui danse mal, et d'ailleurs sans fortune. Enfin, mon père,
ces gens-là n'ont pas de titre. Je veux être au moins comtesse comme
l'est ma mère.
--Tu n'as donc vu personne cet hiver qui...
--Non, mon père.
--Que veux-tu donc?
--Le fils d'un pair de France.
--Ma fille, vous êtes folle! dit monsieur de Fontaine en se levant.
Mais tout à coup il leva les yeux au ciel, sembla puiser une nouvelle
dose de résignation dans une pensée religieuse; puis, jetant un regard
de pitié paternelle sur son enfant, qui devint émue, il lui prit la
main, la serra, et lui dit avec attendrissement:--Dieu m'en est témoin,
pauvre créature égarée! j'ai consciencieusement rempli mes devoirs de
père envers toi, que dis-je, consciencieusement? avec amour, mon Émilie.
Oui, Dieu le sait, cet hiver j'ai amené près de toi plus d'un honnête
homme dont les qualités, les moeurs, le caractère m'étaient connus, et
tous ont paru dignes de toi. Mon enfant, ma tâche est remplie.
D'aujourd'hui je te rends l'arbitre de ton sort, me trouvant heureux et
malheureux tout ensemble de me voir déchargé de la plus lourde des
obligations paternelles. Je ne sais pas si longtemps encore tu entendras
une voix qui, par malheur, n'a jamais été sévère; mais souviens-toi que
le bonheur conjugal ne se fonde pas tant sur des qualités brillantes et
sur la fortune, que sur une estime réciproque. Cette félicité est, de sa
nature, modeste et sans éclat. Va, ma fille, mon aveu est acquis à celui
que tu me présenteras pour gendre; mais si tu devenais malheureuse,
songe que tu n'auras pas le droit d'accuser ton père. Je ne me refuserai
pas à faire des démarches et à t'aider; seulement, que ton choix soit
sérieux, définitif! je ne compromettrai pas deux fois le respect dû à
mes cheveux blancs.
L'affection que lui témoignait son père et l'accent solennel qu'il mit à
son onctueuse allocution touchèrent vivement mademoiselle de Fontaine;
mais elle dissimula son attendrissement, sauta sur les genoux du comte
qui s'était assis tout tremblant encore, lui fit les caresses les plus
douces, et le câlina avec tant de grâce que le front du vieillard se
dérida. Quand Émilie jugea que son père était remis de sa pénible
émotion, elle lui dit à voix basse:--Je vous remercie bien de votre
gracieuse attention, mon cher père. Vous avez arrangé votre appartement
pour recevoir votre fille chérie. Vous ne saviez peut-être pas la
trouver si folle et si rebelle. Mais, mon père, est-il donc bien
difficile d'épouser un pair de France? vous prétendiez qu'on en faisait
par douzaines. Ah! du moins vous ne me refuserez pas des conseils.
--Non, pauvre enfant, non, et je te crierai plus d'une fois: Prends
garde! Songe donc que la pairie est un ressort trop nouveau dans notre
gouvernementabilité, comme disait le feu roi, pour que les pairs
puissent posséder de grandes fortunes. Ceux qui sont riches veulent le
devenir encore plus. Le plus opulent de tous les membres de notre pairie
n'a pas la moitié du revenu que possède le moins riche lord de la
chambre haute en Angleterre. Or les pairs de France chercheront tous de
riches héritières pour leurs fils, n'importe où elles se trouveront. La
nécessité où ils sont tous de faire des mariages d'argent durera plus de
deux siècles. Il est possible qu'en attendant l'heureux hasard que tu
désires, recherche qui peut te coûter tes plus belles années, tes
charmes (car on s'épouse considérablement par amour dans notre siècle),
tes charmes, dis-je, opèrent un prodige. Lorsque l'expérience se cache
sous un visage aussi frais que le tien, l'on peut en espérer des
merveilles. N'as-tu pas d'abord la facilité de reconnaître les vertus
dans le plus ou le moins de volume que prennent les corps? ce n'est pas
un petit mérite. Aussi n'ai-je pas besoin de prévenir une personne aussi
sage que toi de toutes les difficultés de l'entreprise. Je suis certain
que tu ne supposeras jamais à un inconnu du bon sens en lui voyant une
figure flatteuse, ou des vertus en lui trouvant une jolie tournure.
Enfin je suis parfaitement de ton avis sur l'obligation dans laquelle
sont tous les fils de pair d'avoir un air à eux et des manières tout à
fait distinctives. Quoique aujourd'hui rien ne marque le haut rang, ces
jeunes gens-là auront pour toi peut-être un _je ne sais quoi_ qui te les
révélera. D'ailleurs, tu tiens ton coeur en bride comme un bon cavalier
certain de ne pas laisser broncher son coursier. Ma fille, bonne chance.
--Tu te moques de moi, mon père. Eh bien! je te déclare que j'irai
plutôt mourir au couvent de mademoiselle de Condé, que de ne pas être la
femme d'un pair de France.
Elle s'échappa des bras de son père, et, fière d'être sa maîtresse, elle
s'en alla en chantant l'air de _Cara non dubitare_ du _Matrimonio
secreto_. Par hasard la famille fêtait ce jour-là l'anniversaire d'une
fête domestique. Au dessert, madame Planat, la femme du receveur-général
et l'aînée d'Émilie, parla assez hautement d'un jeune Américain,
possesseur d'une immense fortune, qui, devenu passionnément épris de sa
soeur, lui avait fait des propositions extrêmement brillantes.
--C'est un banquier, je crois, dit négligemment Émilie. Je n'aime pas
les gens de finance.
--Mais, Emilie, répondit le baron de Villaine, le mari de la seconde
soeur de mademoiselle de Fontaine, vous n'aimez pas non plus la
magistrature, de manière que je ne vois pas trop, si vous repoussez les
propriétaires non titrés, dans quelle classe vous choisirez un mari.
--Surtout, Emilie, avec ton système de maigreur, ajouta le
lieutenant-général.
--Je sais, répondit la jeune fille, ce qu'il me faut.
--Ma soeur veut un grand nom, dit la baronne de Fontaine, et cent mille
livres de rente, monsieur de Marsay par exemple!
--Je sais, ma chère soeur, reprit Émilie, que je ne ferai pas un sot
mariage comme j'en ai tant vu faire. D'ailleurs, pour éviter ces
discussions nuptiales, je déclare que je regarderai comme les ennemis de
mon repos ceux qui me parleront de mariage.
Un oncle d'Émilie, un vice-amiral, dont la fortune venait de s'augmenter
d'une vingtaine de mille livres de rente par suite de la loi
d'indemnité, vieillard septuagénaire en possession de dire de dures
vérités à sa petite-nièce de laquelle il raffolait, s'écria pour
dissiper l'aigreur de cette conversation:--Ne tourmentez donc pas ma
pauvre Émilie! ne voyez-vous pas qu'elle attend la majorité du duc de
Bordeaux!
Un rire universel accueillit la plaisanterie du vieillard.
--Prenez garde que je ne vous épouse, vieux fou! repartit la jeune
fille, dont les dernières paroles furent heureusement étouffées par le
bruit.
--Mes enfants, dit madame de Fontaine pour adoucir cette impertinence,
Émilie, de même que vous tous, ne prendra conseil que de sa mère.
--Oh! mon Dieu! je n'écouterai que moi dans une affaire qui ne regarde
que moi, dit fort distinctement mademoiselle de Fontaine.
Tous les regards se portèrent alors sur le chef de la famille. Chacun
semblait être curieux de voir comment il allait s'y prendre pour
maintenir sa dignité. Non-seulement le vénérable Vendéen jouissait d'une
grande considération dans le monde; mais encore, plus heureux que bien
des pères, il était apprécié par sa famille, dont tous les membres
avaient su reconnaître les qualités solides qui lui servaient à faire la
fortune des siens. Aussi était-il entouré de ce profond respect que
témoignent les familles anglaises et quelques maisons aristocratiques du
continent au représentant de l'arbre généalogique. Il s'établit un
profond silence, et les yeux des convives se portèrent alternativement
sur la figure boudeuse et altière de l'enfant gâté et sur les visages
sévères de monsieur et de madame de Fontaine.
--J'ai laissé ma fille Émilie maîtresse de son sort, fut la réponse que
laissa tomber le comte d'un son de voix profond.
Les parents et les convives regardèrent alors mademoiselle de Fontaine
avec une curiosité mêlée de pitié. Cette parole semblait annoncer que la
bonté paternelle s'était lassée de lutter contre un caractère que la
famille savait être incorrigible. Les gendres murmurèrent, et les frères
lancèrent à leurs femmes des sourires moqueurs. Dès ce moment, chacun
cessa de s'intéresser au mariage de l'orgueilleuse fille. Son vieil
oncle fut le seul qui, en sa qualité d'ancien marin, osât courir des
bordées avec elle et essuyer ses boutades, sans être jamais embarrassé
de lui rendre feu pour feu.
Quand la belle saison fut venue après le vote du budget, cette famille,
véritable modèle des familles parlementaires de l'autre bord de la
Manche, qui ont un pied dans toutes les administrations et dix voix aux
Communes, s'envola, comme une nichée d'oiseaux, vers les beaux sites
d'Aulnay, d'Antony et de Châtenay. L'opulent receveur-général avait
récemment acheté dans ces parages une maison de campagne pour sa femme,
qui ne restait à Paris que pendant les sessions. Quoique la belle Émilie
méprisât la roture, ce sentiment n'allait pas jusqu'à dédaigner les
avantages de la fortune amassée par les bourgeois. Elle accompagna donc
sa soeur à sa _villa_ somptueuse, moins par amitié pour les personnes de
sa famille qui s'y réfugièrent, que parce que le bon ton ordonne
impérieusement à toute femme qui se respecte d'abandonner Paris pendant
l'été. Les vertes campagnes de Sceaux remplissaient admirablement bien
les conditions exigées par le bon ton et le devoir des charges
publiques. Comme il est un peu douteux que la réputation du bal
champêtre de Sceaux ait jamais dépassé l'enceinte du département de la
Seine, il est nécessaire de donner quelques détails sur cette fête
hebdomadaire qui, par son importance, menaçait alors de devenir une
institution. Les environs de la petite ville de Sceaux jouissent d'une
renommée due à des sites qui passent pour être ravissants. Peut-être
sont-ils fort ordinaires et ne doivent-ils leur célébrité qu'à la
stupidité des bourgeois de Paris, qui, au sortir des abîmes de moellon
où ils sont ensevelis, seraient disposés à admirer les plaines de la
Beauce. Cependant les poétiques ombrages d'Aulnay, les collines d'Antony
et la vallée de Bièvre étant habités par quelques artistes qui ont
voyagé, par des étrangers, gens fort difficiles, et par nombre de jolies
femmes qui ne manquent pas de goût, il est à croire que les Parisiens
ont raison. Mais Sceaux possède un autre attrait non moins puissant sur
le Parisien. Au milieu d'un jardin d'où se découvrent de délicieux
aspects, se trouve une immense rotonde ouverte de toutes parts dont le
dôme aussi léger que vaste est soutenu par d'élégants piliers. Ce dais
champêtre protége une salle de danse. Il est rare que les propriétaires
les plus collets-montés du voisinage n'émigrent pas une fois ou deux
pendant la saison, vers ce palais de la Terpsichore villageoise, soit en
cavalcades brillantes, soit dans ces élégantes et légères voitures qui
saupoudrent de poussière les piétons philosophes. L'espoir de rencontrer
là quelques femmes du beau monde et d'être vus par elles, l'espoir
moins souvent trompé d'y voir de jeunes paysannes aussi rusées que des
juges, fait accourir le dimanche, au bal de Sceaux, de nombreux essaims
de clercs d'avoué, de disciples d'Esculape et de jeunes gens dont le
teint blanc et la fraîcheur sont entretenus par l'air humide des
arrière-boutiques parisiennes. Aussi bon nombre de mariages bourgeois se
sont-ils ébauchés aux sons de l'orchestre qui occupe le centre de cette
salle circulaire. Si le toit pouvait parler, que d'amours ne
raconterait-il pas! Cette intéressante mêlée rend le bal de Sceaux plus
piquant que ne le sont deux ou trois autres bals des environs de Paris,
sur lesquels sa rotonde, la beauté du site et les agréments de son
jardin lui donnent d'incontestables avantages. Émilie, la première,
manifesta le désir d'aller _faire peuple_ à ce joyeux bal de
l'arrondissement, en se promettant un énorme plaisir à se trouver au
milieu de cette assemblée. On s'étonna de son désir d'errer au sein
d'une telle cohue; mais l'incognito n'est-il pas pour les grands une
très-vive jouissance! Mademoiselle de Fontaine se plaisait à se figurer
toutes ces tournures citadines, elle se voyait laissant dans plus d'un
coeur bourgeois le souvenir d'un regard et d'un sourire enchanteurs,
riait déjà des danseuses à prétentions, et taillait ses crayons pour les
scènes avec lesquelles elle comptait enrichir les pages de son album
satirique. Le dimanche n'arriva jamais assez tôt au gré de son
impatience. La société du pavillon Planat se mit en route à pied, afin
de ne pas commettre d'indiscrétion sur le rang des personnages qui
voulaient honorer le bal de leur présence. On avait dîné de bonne heure.
Enfin, le mois de mai favorisa cette escapade aristocratique par la plus
belle de ses soirées. Mademoiselle de Fontaine fut toute surprise de
trouver, sous la rotonde, quelques quadrilles composés de personnes qui
paraissaient appartenir à la bonne compagnie. Elle vit bien, çà et là,
quelques jeunes gens qui semblaient avoir employé les économies d'un
mois pour briller pendant une journée, et reconnut plusieurs couples
dont la joie trop franche n'accusait rien de conjugal; mais elle n'eut
qu'à glaner au lieu de récolter. Elle s'étonna de voir le plaisir
habillé de percale ressembler si fort au plaisir vêtu de satin, et la
bourgeoise danser avec autant de grâce et quelquefois mieux que ne
dansait la noblesse. La plupart des toilettes étaient simples et bien
portées. Ceux qui, dans cette assemblée, représentaient les suzerains du
territoire, c'est-à-dire les paysans, se tenaient dans leur coin avec
une incroyable politesse. Il fallut même à mademoiselle Émilie une
certaine étude des divers éléments qui composaient cette réunion avant
de pouvoir y trouver un sujet de plaisanterie. Mais elle n'eut ni le
temps de se livrer à ses malicieuses critiques, ni le loisir d'entendre
beaucoup de ces propos saillants que les caricaturistes recueillent avec
joie. L'orgueilleuse créature rencontra subitement dans ce vaste champ
une fleur, la métaphore est de saison, dont l'éclat et les couleurs
agirent sur son imagination avec les prestiges d'une nouveauté. Il nous
arrive souvent de regarder une robe, une tenture, un papier blanc avec
assez de distraction pour n'y pas apercevoir sur-le-champ une tache ou
quelque point brillant qui plus tard frappent tout à coup notre oeil
comme s'ils y survenaient à l'instant seulement où nous les voyons; par
une espèce de phénomène moral assez semblable à celui-là, mademoiselle
de Fontaine reconnut dans un jeune homme le type des perfections
extérieures qu'elle rêvait depuis si longtemps.
Assise sur une de ces chaises grossières qui décrivaient l'enceinte
obligée de la salle, elle s'était placée à l'extrémité du groupe formé
par sa famille, afin de pouvoir se lever ou s'avancer suivant ses
fantaisies, en se comportant avec les vivants tableaux et les groupes
offerts par cette salle, comme à l'exposition du Musée. Elle braquait
impertinemment son lorgnon sur une personne qui se trouvait à deux pas
d'elle, et faisait ses réflexions comme si elle eût critiqué ou loué une
tête d'étude, une scène de genre. Ses regards, après avoir erré sur
cette vaste toile animée, furent tout à coup saisis par cette figure qui
semblait avoir été mise exprès dans un coin du tableau, sous le plus
beau jour, comme un personnage hors de toute proportion avec le reste.
L'inconnu, rêveur et solitaire, légèrement appuyé sur une des colonnes
qui supportent le toit, avait les bras croisés et se tenait penché comme
s'il se fût placé là pour permettre à un peintre de faire son portrait.
Quoique pleine d'élégance et de fierté, cette attitude était exempte
d'affectation. Aucun geste ne démontrait qu'il eût mis sa face de trois
quarts et faiblement incliné sa tête à droite, comme Alexandre, comme
lord Byron, et quelques autres grands hommes, dans le seul but d'attirer
sur lui l'attention. Son regard fixe suivait les mouvements d'une
danseuse, en trahissant quelque sentiment profond. Sa taille svelte et
dégagée rappelait les belles proportions de l'Apollon. De beaux cheveux
noirs se bouclaient naturellement sur son front élevé. D'un seul coup
d'oeil mademoiselle de Fontaine remarqua la finesse de son linge, la
fraîcheur de ses gants de chevreau évidemment pris chez le bon faiseur,
et la petitesse d'un pied bien chaussé dans une botte de peau d'Irlande.
Il ne portait aucun de ces ignobles brimborions dont se chargent les
anciens petits-maîtres de la garde nationale, ou les Adonis de comptoir.
Seulement un ruban noir auquel était suspendu son lorgnon flottait sur
un gilet d'une coupe distinguée. Jamais la difficile Émilie n'avait vu
les yeux d'un homme ombragés par des cils si longs et si recourbés. La
mélancolie et la passion respiraient dans cette figure caractérisée par
un teint olivâtre et mâle. Sa bouche semblait toujours prête à sourire
et à relever les coins de deux lèvres éloquentes; mais cette
disposition, loin de tenir à la gaieté, révélait plutôt une sorte de
grâce triste. Il y avait trop d'avenir dans cette tête, trop de
distinction dans la personne, pour qu'on pût dire:--Voilà un bel homme
ou un joli homme! on désirait le connaître. En voyant l'inconnu,
l'observateur le plus perspicace n'aurait pu s'empêcher de le prendre
pour un homme de talent attiré par quelque intérêt puissant à cette fête
de village.
Cette masse d'observations ne coûta guère à Émilie qu'un moment
d'attention, pendant lequel cet homme privilégié, soumis à une analyse
sévère, devint l'objet d'une secrète admiration. Elle ne se dit pas:--Il
faut qu'il soit pair de France! mais--Oh! s'il est noble, et il doit
l'être... Sans achever sa pensée, elle se leva tout à coup, alla, suivie
de son frère le lieutenant-général, vers cette colonne en paraissant
regarder les joyeux quadrilles; mais par un artifice d'optique familier
aux femmes, elle ne perdait pas un seul des mouvements du jeune homme,
de qui elle s'approcha. L'inconnu s'éloigna poliment pour céder la place
aux deux survenants, et s'appuya sur une autre colonne. Émilie, aussi
piquée de la politesse de l'étranger qu'elle l'eût été d'une
impertinence, se mit à causer avec son frère en élevant la voix beaucoup
plus que le bon ton ne le voulait; elle prit des airs de tête, multiplia
ses gestes et rit sans trop en avoir sujet, moins pour amuser son frère
que pour attirer l'attention de l'imperturbable inconnu. Aucun de ces
petits artifices ne réussit. Mademoiselle de Fontaine suivit alors la
direction que prenaient les regards du jeune homme, et aperçut la cause
de cette insouciance.
Au milieu du quadrille qui se trouvait devant elle, dansait une jeune
personne pâle, et semblable à ces déités écossaises que Girodet a
placées dans son immense composition des guerriers français reçus par
Ossian. Émilie crut reconnaître en elle une illustre lady qui était
venue habiter depuis peu de temps une campagne voisine. Elle avait pour
cavalier un jeune homme de quinze ans, aux mains rouges, en pantalon de
nankin, en habit bleu, en souliers blancs, qui prouvait que son amour
pour la danse ne la rendait pas difficile sur le choix de ses partners.
Ses mouvements ne se ressentaient pas de son apparente faiblesse; mais
une rougeur légère colorait déjà ses joues blanches, et son teint
commençait à s'animer. Mademoiselle de Fontaine s'approcha du quadrille
pour pouvoir examiner l'étrangère au moment où elle reviendrait à sa
place, pendant que les vis-à-vis répéteraient la figure qu'elle
exécutait. Mais l'inconnu s'avança, se pencha vers la jolie danseuse, et
la curieuse Émilie put entendre distinctement ces paroles, quoique
prononcées d'une voix à la fois impérieuse et douce:
--Clara, mon enfant, ne dansez plus.
Clara fit une petite moue boudeuse, inclina la tête en signe
d'obéissance et finit par sourire. Après la contredanse, le jeune homme
eut les précautions d'un amant en mettant sur les épaules de la jeune
fille un châle de cachemire, et la fit asseoir de manière à ce qu'elle
fût à l'abri du vent. Puis bientôt mademoiselle de Fontaine, qui les vit
se lever et se promener autour de l'enceinte comme des gens disposés à
partir, trouva le moyen de les suivre sous prétexte d'admirer les points
de vue du jardin. Son frère se prêta avec une malicieuse bonhomie aux
caprices de cette marche assez vagabonde. Émilie aperçut alors ce joli
couple montant dans un élégant tilbury que gardait un domestique à
cheval et en livrée. Au moment où le jeune homme fut assis et tâcha de
rendre les guides égales, elle obtint d'abord de lui un de ces regards
que l'on jette sans but sur les grandes foules; mais elle eut la faible
satisfaction de lui voir retourner la tête à deux reprises différentes,
et la jeune inconnue l'imita. Était-ce jalousie?
--Je présume que tu as maintenant assez observé le jardin, lui dit son
frère, nous pouvons retourner à la danse.
--Je le veux bien, répondit-elle. Croyez-vous que ce soit lady Dudley?
--Elle ne sortirait pas sans Félix de Vandenesse, lui dit son frère en
souriant.
--Lady Dudley ne peut-elle pas avoir chez elle des parents...
--Un jeune homme, oui, reprit le baron de Fontaine; mais une jeune
personne, non!
Le lendemain, mademoiselle de Fontaine manifesta le désir de faire une
promenade à cheval. Insensiblement elle accoutuma son vieil oncle et ses
frères à l'accompagner dans certaines courses matinales,
très-salutaires, disait-elle, pour sa santé. Elle affectionnait
singulièrement les alentours du village habité par lady Dudley. Malgré
ses manoeuvres de cavalerie, elle ne revit pas l'étranger aussi
promptement que la joyeuse recherche à laquelle elle se livrait pouvait
le lui faire espérer. Elle retourna plusieurs fois au bal de Sceaux,
sans pouvoir y trouver le jeune Anglais tombé du ciel pour dominer ses
rêves et les embellir. Quoique rien n'aiguillonne plus le naissant amour
d'une jeune fille qu'un obstacle, il y eut cependant un moment où
mademoiselle Emilie de Fontaine fut sur le point d'abandonner son
étrange et secrète poursuite, en désespérant presque du succès d'une
entreprise dont la singularité peut donner une idée de la hardiesse de
son caractère. Elle aurait pu en effet tourner longtemps autour du
village de Châtenay sans revoir son inconnu. La jeune Clara, puisque tel
est le nom que mademoiselle de Fontaine avait entendu, n'était pas
Anglaise, et le prétendu étranger n'habitait pas les bosquets fleuris et
embaumés de Châtenay.
Un soir, Émilie sortie à cheval avec son oncle, qui depuis les beaux
jours avait obtenu de sa goutte une assez longue cessation d'hostilités,
rencontra lady Dudley. L'illustre étrangère avait auprès d'elle dans sa
calèche monsieur Vandenesse. Émilie reconnut le couple, et ses
suppositions furent en un moment dissipées comme se dissipent les rêves.
Dépitée comme toute femme frustrée dans son attente, elle tourna bride
si rapidement, que son oncle eut toutes les peines du monde à les
suivre, tant elle avait lancé son poney.
--Je suis apparemment devenu trop vieux pour comprendre ces esprits de
vingt ans, se dit le marin en mettant son cheval au galop, ou peut-être
la jeunesse d'aujourd'hui ne ressemble-t-elle plus à celle d'autrefois.
Mais qu'a donc ma nièce? La voilà maintenant qui marche à petits pas
comme un gendarme en patrouille dans les rues de Paris. Ne dirait-on pas
qu'elle veut cerner ce brave bourgeois qui m'a l'air d'être un auteur
rêvassant à ses poésies, car il a, je crois, un _album_ à la main. Par
ma foi, je suis un grand sot! Ne serait-ce pas le jeune homme en quête
de qui nous sommes?
A cette pensée le vieux marin fit marcher tout doucement son cheval sur
le sable, de manière à pouvoir arriver sans bruit auprès de sa nièce. Le
vice-amiral avait fait trop de noirceurs dans les années 1771 et
suivantes, époques de nos annales où la galanterie était en honneur,
pour ne pas deviner sur-le-champ qu'Émilie avait par le plus grand
hasard rencontré l'inconnu du bal de Sceaux. Malgré le voile que l'âge
répandait sur ses yeux gris, le comte de Kergarouët sut reconnaître les
indices d'une agitation extraordinaire chez sa nièce, en dépit de
l'immobilité qu'elle essayait d'imprimer à son visage. Les yeux perçants
de la jeune fille étaient fixés avec une sorte de stupeur sur l'étranger
qui marchait paisiblement devant elle.
--C'est bien ça! se dit le marin, elle va le suivre comme un vaisseau
marchand suit un corsaire. Puis, quand elle l'aura vu s'éloigner, elle
sera au désespoir de ne pas savoir qui elle aime, et d'ignorer si c'est
un marquis ou un bourgeois. Vraiment les jeunes têtes devraient toujours
avoir auprès d'elles une vieille perruque comme moi...
Il poussa tout à coup son cheval à l'improviste de manière à faire
partir celui de sa nièce, et passa si vite entre elle et le jeune
promeneur, qu'il le força de se jeter sur le talus de verdure qui
encaissait le chemin. Arrêtant aussitôt son cheval, le comte s'écria:
--Ne pouviez-vous pas vous ranger?
--Ah! pardon, monsieur, répondit l'inconnu. J'ignorais que ce fût à moi
de vous faire des excuses de ce que vous avez failli me renverser.
--Eh! l'ami, finissons, reprit aigrement le marin en prenant un son de
voix dont le ricanement avait quelque chose d'insultant.
En même temps le comte leva sa cravache comme pour fouetter son cheval,
et toucha l'épaule de son interlocuteur en disant:--Le bourgeois libéral
est raisonneur, tout raisonneur doit être sage.
Le jeune homme gravit le talus de la route en entendant ce sarcasme; il
se croisa les bras et répondit d'un ton fort ému:--Monsieur, je ne puis
croire, en voyant vos cheveux blancs, que vous vous amusiez encore à
chercher des duels.
--Cheveux blancs? s'écria le marin en l'interrompant, tu en as menti par
ta gorge, ils ne sont que gris.
Une dispute ainsi commencée devint en quelques secondes si chaude, que
le jeune adversaire oublia le ton de modération qu'il s'était efforcé de
conserver. Au moment où le comte de Kergarouët vit sa nièce arrivant à
eux avec toutes les marques d'une vive inquiétude, il donnait son nom à
son antagoniste en lui disant de garder le silence devant la jeune
personne confiée à ses soins. L'inconnu ne put s'empêcher de sourire et
remit une carte au vieux marin en lui faisant observer qu'il habitait
une maison de campagne à Chevreuse, et s'éloigna rapidement après la lui
avoir indiquée.
--Vous avez manqué blesser ce pauvre pékin, ma nièce, dit le comte en
s'empressant d'aller au-devant d'Émilie. Vous ne savez donc plus tenir
votre cheval en bride. Vous me laissez là compromettre ma dignité pour
couvrir vos folies; tandis que si vous étiez restée, un seul de vos
regards ou une de vos paroles polies, une de celles que vous dites si
joliment quand vous n'êtes pas impertinente, aurait tout raccommodé, lui
eussiez-vous cassé le bras.
--Eh! mon cher oncle, c'est votre cheval, et non le mien, qui est la
cause de cet accident. Je crois, en vérité, que vous ne pouvez plus
monter à cheval, vous n'êtes déjà plus si bon cavalier que vous l'étiez
l'année dernière. Mais au lieu de dire des riens...
--Diantre! des riens. Ce n'est donc rien que de faire une impertinence à
votre oncle?
--Ne devrions-nous pas aller savoir si ce jeune homme est blessé? Il
boite, mon oncle, voyez donc.
--Non, il court. Ah! je l'ai rudement morigéné.
--Ah! mon oncle, je vous reconnais là.
--Halte-là, ma nièce, dit le comte en arrêtant le cheval d'Émilie par la
bride. Je ne vois pas la nécessité de faire des avances à quelque
boutiquier trop heureux d'avoir été jeté à terre par une charmante jeune
fille ou par le commandant de la _Belle-Poule_.
--Pourquoi croyez-vous que ce soit un roturier, mon cher oncle? Il me
semble qu'il a des manières fort distinguées.
--Tout le monde a des manières aujourd'hui, ma nièce.
--Non, mon oncle, tout le monde n'a pas l'air et la tournure que donne
l'habitude des salons, et je parierais avec vous volontiers que ce jeune
homme est noble.
--Vous n'avez pas trop eu le temps de l'examiner.
--Mais ce n'est pas la première fois que je le vois.
--Et ce n'est pas non plus la première fois que vous le cherchez, lui
répliqua l'amiral en riant.
Émilie rougit, son oncle se plut à la laisser quelque temps dans
l'embarras; puis il lui dit:--Émilie, vous savez que je vous aime comme
mon enfant, précisément parce que vous êtes la seule de la famille qui
ayez cet orgueil légitime que donne une haute naissance. Diantre! ma
petite-nièce, qui aurait cru que les bons principes deviendraient si
rares? Eh bien, je veux être votre confident. Ma chère petite, je vois
que ce jeune gentilhomme ne vous est pas indifférent. Chut! Ils se
moqueraient de nous dans la famille si nous nous embarquions sous un
méchant pavillon. Vous savez ce que cela veut dire. Ainsi laissez-moi
vous aider, ma nièce. Gardons-nous tous deux le secret, et je vous
promets de l'amener au milieu du salon.
--Et quand, mon oncle?
--Demain.
--Mais, mon cher oncle, je ne serai obligée à rien?
--A rien du tout, et vous pourrez le bombarder, l'incendier, et le
laisser là comme une vieille caraque si cela vous plaît. Ce ne sera pas
le premier, n'est-ce pas?
--Êtes-vous bon, mon oncle!
Aussitôt que le comte fut rentré, il mit ses besicles, tira secrètement
la carte de sa poche et lut: MAXIMILIEN LONGUEVILLE, RUE DU SENTIER.
--Soyez tranquille, ma chère nièce, dit-il à Émilie, vous pouvez le
harponner en toute sécurité de conscience, il appartient à l'une de nos
familles historiques; et s'il n'est pas pair de France, il le sera
infailliblement.
--D'où savez-vous tant de choses?
--C'est mon secret.
--Vous connaissez donc son nom?
Le comte inclina en silence sa tête grise qui ressemblait assez à un
vieux tronc de chêne autour duquel auraient voltigé quelques feuilles
roulées par le froid d'automne; à ce signe, sa nièce vint essayer sur
lui le pouvoir toujours neuf de ses coquetteries. Instruite dans l'art
de cajoler le vieux marin, elle lui prodigua les caresses les plus
enfantines, les paroles les plus tendres; elle alla même jusqu'à
l'embrasser, afin d'obtenir de lui la révélation d'un secret si
important. Le vieillard, qui passait sa vie à faire jouer à sa nièce ces
sortes de scènes, et qui les payait souvent par le prix d'une parure ou
par l'abandon de sa loge aux Italiens, se complut cette fois à se
laisser prier et surtout caresser. Mais, comme il faisait durer ses
plaisirs trop longtemps, Émilie se fâcha, passa des caresses aux
sarcasmes et bouda, puis elle revint dominée par la curiosité. Le marin
diplomate obtint solennellement de sa nièce une promesse d'être à
l'avenir plus réservée, plus douce, moins volontaire, de dépenser moins
d'argent, et surtout de lui tout dire. Le traité conclu et signé par un
baiser qu'il déposa sur le front blanc d'Émilie, il l'amena dans un coin
du salon, l'assit sur ses genoux, plaça la carte sous ses deux pouces de
manière à la cacher, découvrit lettre à lettre le nom de Longueville, et
refusa fort obstinément d'en laisser voir davantage. Cet événement
rendit le sentiment secret de mademoiselle de Fontaine plus intense.
Elle déroula pendant une grande partie de la nuit les tableaux les plus
brillants des rêves par lesquels elle avait nourri ses espérances.
Enfin, grâce à ce hasard imploré si souvent, elle voyait maintenant tout
autre chose qu'une chimère à la source des richesses imaginaires avec
lesquelles elle dorait sa vie conjugale. Comme toutes les jeunes
personnes, ignorant les dangers de l'amour et du mariage, elle se
passionna pour les dehors trompeurs du mariage et de l'amour. N'est-ce
pas dire que son sentiment naquit comme naissent presque tous ces
caprices du premier âge, douces et cruelles erreurs qui exercent une si
fatale influence sur l'existence des jeunes filles assez inexpérimentées
pour ne s'en remettre qu'à elles-mêmes du soin de leur bonheur à venir?
Le lendemain matin, avant qu'Émilie fût réveillée, son oncle avait couru
à Chevreuse. En reconnaissant dans la cour d'un élégant pavillon le
jeune homme qu'il avait si résolument insulté la veille, il alla vers
lui avec cette affectueuse politesse des vieillards de l'ancienne cour.
--Eh! mon cher monsieur, qui aurait dit que je me ferais une affaire, à
l'âge de soixante-treize ans, avec le fils ou le petit-fils d'un de mes
meilleurs amis? Je suis vice-amiral, monsieur. N'est-ce pas vous dire
que je m'embarrasse aussi peu d'un duel que de fumer un cigare. Dans mon
temps, deux jeunes gens ne pouvaient devenir intimes qu'après avoir vu
la couleur de leur sang. Mais, ventre-de-biche! hier, j'avais, en ma
qualité de marin, embarqué un peu trop de rhum à bord, et j'ai sombré
sur vous. Touchez là! j'aimerais mieux recevoir cent rebuffades d'un
Longueville que de causer la moindre peine à sa famille.
Quelque froideur que le jeune homme s'efforçât de marquer au comte de
Kergarouët, il ne put longtemps tenir à la franche bonté de ses
manières, et se laissa serrer la main.
--Vous alliez monter à cheval, dit le comte, ne vous gênez pas. Mais à
moins que vous n'ayez des projets, venez avec moi, je vous invite à
dîner aujourd'hui au pavillon Planat. Mon neveu, le comte de Fontaine,
est un homme essentiel à connaître. Ah! je prétends, morbleu, vous
dédommager de ma brusquerie en vous présentant à cinq des plus jolies
femmes de Paris. Hé! hé! jeune homme, votre front se déride. J'aime les
jeunes gens, et j'aime à les voir heureux. Leur bonheur me rappelle les
bienfaisantes années de ma jeunesse où les aventures ne manquaient pas
plus que les duels. On était gai, alors! Aujourd'hui, vous raisonnez, et
l'on s'inquiète de tout, comme s'il n'y avait eu ni quinzième ni
seizième siècles.
--Mais, monsieur, n'avons-nous pas raison! Le seizième siècle n'a donné
que la liberté religieuse à l'Europe, et le dix-neuvième lui donnera la
liberté pol...
--Ah! ne parlons pas politique. Je suis une _ganache_ d'ultrà,
voyez-vous. Mais je n'empêche pas les jeunes gens d'être
révolutionnaires, pourvu qu'ils laissent au Roi la liberté de dissiper
leurs attroupements.
A quelques pas de là, lorsque le comte et son jeune compagnon furent au
milieu des bois, le marin avisa un jeune bouleau assez mince, arrêta son
cheval, prit un de ses pistolets, et la balle alla se loger au milieu de
l'arbre à quinze pas de distance.
--Vous voyez, mon cher, que je ne crains pas un duel, dit-il avec une
gravité comique en regardant monsieur Longueville.
--Ni moi non plus, répliqua ce dernier qui arma promptement son
pistolet, visa le trou fait par la balle du comte, et plaça la sienne
près de ce but.
--Voilà ce qui s'appelle un jeune homme bien élevé, s'écria le marin
avec une sorte d'enthousiasme.
Pendant la promenade qu'il fit avec celui qu'il regardait déjà comme son
neveu, il trouva mille occasions de l'interroger sur toutes les
bagatelles dont la parfaite connaissance constituait, selon son code
particulier, un gentilhomme accompli.
--Avez-vous des dettes? demanda-t-il enfin à son compagnon après bien
des questions.
--Non, monsieur.
--Comment! vous payez tout ce qui vous est fourni?
--Exactement, monsieur; autrement, nous perdrions tout crédit et toute
espèce de considération.
--Mais au moins vous avez plus d'une maîtresse? Ah! vous rougissez, mon
camarade?... les moeurs ont bien changé. Avec ces idées d'ordre légal,
de kantisme et de liberté, la jeunesse s'est gâtée. Vous n'avez ni
Guimard, ni Duthé, ni créanciers, et vous ne savez pas le blason; mais,
mon jeune ami, vous n'êtes pas _élevé_! Sachez que celui qui ne fait pas
ses folies au printemps les fait en hiver. Si j'ai quatre-vingt mille
livres de rente à soixante-dix ans, c'est que j'en ai mangé le capital à
trente ans... Oh! avec ma femme, en tout bien tout honneur. Néanmoins,
vos imperfections ne m'empêcheront pas de vous annoncer au pavillon
Planat. Songez que vous m'avez promis d'y venir, et je vous y attends.
--Quel singulier petit vieillard, se dit le jeune Longueville, il est
vert et gaillard; mais quoiqu'il veuille paraître bon homme, je ne m'y
fierai pas.
Le lendemain, vers quatre heures, au moment où la compagnie était éparse
dans les salons ou au billard, un domestique annonça aux habitants du
pavillon Planat: Monsieur _de_ Longueville. Au nom du favori du vieux
comte de Kergarouët, tout le monde, jusqu'au joueur qui allait manquer
une bille, accourut, autant pour observer la contenance de mademoiselle
de Fontaine que pour juger le phénix humain qui avait mérité une mention
honorable au détriment de tant de rivaux. Une mise aussi élégante que
simple, des manières pleines d'aisance, des formes polies, une voix
douce et d'un timbre qui faisait vibrer les cordes du coeur,
concilièrent à monsieur Longueville la bienveillance de toute la
famille. Il ne sembla pas étranger au luxe de la demeure du fastueux
receveur-général. Quoique sa conversation fût celle d'un homme du monde,
chacun put facilement deviner qu'il avait reçu la plus brillante
éducation et que ses connaissances étaient aussi solides qu'étendues. Il
trouva si bien le mot propre dans une discussion assez légère suscitée
par le vieux marin sur les constructions navales, qu'une des femmes fit
observer qu'il semblait être sorti de l'École Polytechnique.
--Je crois, madame, répondit-il, qu'on peut regarder comme un titre de
gloire d'y être entré.
Malgré toutes les instances qui lui furent faites, il se refusa avec
politesse, mais avec fermeté, au désir qu'on lui témoigna de le garder à
dîner, et arrêta les observations des dames en disant qu'il était
l'Hippocrate d'une jeune soeur dont la santé délicate exigeait beaucoup
de soins.
--Monsieur est sans doute médecin? demanda avec ironie une des
belles-soeurs d'Émilie.
--Monsieur est sorti de l'École Polytechnique, répondit avec bonté
mademoiselle de Fontaine dont la figure s'anima des teintes les plus
riches au moment où elle apprit que la jeune fille du bal était la soeur
de monsieur Longueville.
--Mais, ma chère, on peut être médecin et avoir été à l'École
Polytechnique, n'est-ce pas, monsieur?
--Madame, rien ne s'y oppose, répondit le jeune homme.
Tous les yeux se portèrent sur Émilie qui regardait alors avec une sorte
de curiosité inquiète le séduisant inconnu. Elle respira plus librement
quand il ajouta, non sans un sourire:--Je n'ai pas l'honneur d'être
médecin, madame, et j'ai même renoncé à entrer dans le service des
ponts-et-chaussées afin de conserver mon indépendance.
--Et vous avez bien fait, dit le comte. Mais comment pouvez-vous
regarder comme un honneur d'être médecin? ajouta le noble Breton. Ah!
mon jeune ami, pour un homme comme vous...
--Monsieur le comte, je respecte infiniment toutes les professions qui
ont un but d'utilité.
--Eh! nous sommes d'accord: vous respectez ces professions-là,
j'imagine, comme un jeune homme respecte une douairière.
La visite de monsieur Longueville ne fut ni trop longue, ni trop courte.
Il se retira au moment où il s'aperçut qu'il avait plu à tout le monde,
et que la curiosité de chacun s'était éveillée sur son compte.
--C'est un rusé compère, dit le comte en rentrant au salon après l'avoir
reconduit.
Mademoiselle de Fontaine, qui seule était dans le secret de cette
visite, avait fait une toilette assez recherchée pour attirer les
regards du jeune homme; mais elle eut le petit chagrin de voir qu'il ne
lui accorda pas autant d'attention qu'elle croyait en mériter. La
famille fut assez surprise du silence dans lequel elle s'était
renfermée. Émilie déployait ordinairement pour les nouveaux venus sa
coquetterie, son babil spirituel, et l'inépuisable éloquence de ses
regards et de ses attitudes. Soit que la voix mélodieuse du jeune homme
et l'attrait de ses manières l'eussent charmée, qu'elle aimât
sérieusement, et que ce sentiment eût opéré en elle un changement, son
maintien perdit toute affectation. Devenue simple et naturelle, elle dut
sans doute paraître plus belle. Quelques-unes de ses soeurs et une
vieille dame, amie de la famille, virent un raffinement de coquetterie
dans cette conduite. Elles supposèrent que, jugeant le jeune homme digne
d'elle, Émilie se proposait peut-être de ne montrer que lentement ses
avantages, afin de l'éblouir tout à coup, au moment où elle lui aurait
plu. Toutes les personnes de la famille étaient curieuses de savoir ce
que cette capricieuse fille pensait de cet étranger; mais lorsque,
pendant le dîner, chacun prit plaisir à doter monsieur Longueville d'une
qualité nouvelle, en prétendant l'avoir seul découverte, mademoiselle de
Fontaine resta muette pendant quelque temps. Un léger sarcasme de son
oncle la réveilla tout à coup de son apathie; elle dit d'une manière
assez épigrammatique que cette perfection céleste devait couvrir quelque
grand défaut, et qu'elle se garderait bien de juger à la première vue un
homme qui paraissait être si habile. Elle ajouta que ceux qui plaisaient
ainsi à tout le monde ne plaisaient à personne, et que le pire de tous
les défauts était de n'en avoir aucun. Comme toutes les jeunes filles
qui aiment, elle caressait l'espérance de pouvoir cacher son sentiment
au fond de son coeur en donnant le change aux Argus qui l'entouraient;
mais, au bout d'une quinzaine de jours, il n'y eut pas un des membres de
cette nombreuse famille qui ne fût initié dans ce petit secret
domestique. A la troisième visite que fit monsieur Longueville, Émilie
crut y être pour beaucoup. Cette découverte lui causa un plaisir si
enivrant, qu'elle l'étonna quand elle put réfléchir. Il y avait là
quelque chose de pénible pour son orgueil. Habituée à se faire le centre
du monde, elle était obligée de reconnaître une force qui l'attirait
hors d'elle-même. Elle essaya de se révolter, mais elle ne put chasser
de son coeur la séduisante image du jeune homme. Puis vinrent bientôt
des inquiétudes. En effet, deux qualités de monsieur Longueville
très-contraires à la curiosité générale, et surtout à celle de
mademoiselle de Fontaine, étaient une discrétion et une modestie
inattendues. Il ne parlait jamais ni de lui, ni de ses occupations, ni
de sa famille. Les finesses qu'Émilie semait dans sa conversation et les
piéges qu'elle y tendait pour arracher à ce jeune homme des détails sur
lui-même, il savait les déconcerter avec l'adresse d'un diplomate qui
veut cacher des secrets. Parlait-elle peinture, monsieur Longueville
répondait en connaisseur. Faisait-elle de la musique, le jeune homme
prouvait sans fatuité qu'il était assez fort sur le piano. Un soir, il
enchanta toute la compagnie, en mariant sa voix délicieuse à celle
d'Émilie dans un des plus beaux duos de Cimarosa; mais quand on essaya
de s'informer s'il était artiste, il plaisanta avec tant de grâce, qu'il
ne laissa pas à ces femmes si exercées dans l'art de deviner les
sentiments, la possibilité de découvrir à quelle sphère sociale il
appartenait. Avec quelque courage que le vieil oncle jetât le grappin
sur ce bâtiment, Longueville s'esquivait avec souplesse afin de se
conserver le charme du mystère; et il lui fut d'autant plus facile de
rester le _bel inconnu_ au pavillon Planat, que la curiosité n'y
excédait pas les bornes de la politesse. Émilie, tourmentée de cette
réserve, espéra tirer meilleur parti de la soeur que du frère pour ces
sortes de confidences. Secondée par son oncle, qui s'entendait aussi
bien à cette manoeuvre qu'à celle d'un bâtiment, elle essaya de mettre
en scène le personnage jusqu'alors muet de mademoiselle Clara
Longueville. La société du pavillon manifesta bientôt le plus grand
désir de connaître une si aimable personne, et de lui procurer quelque
distraction. Un bal sans cérémonie fut proposé et accepté. Les dames ne
désespérèrent pas complétement de faire parler une jeune fille de seize
ans.
Malgré ces petits nuages amoncelés par le soupçon et créés par la
curiosité, une vive lumière pénétrait l'âme de mademoiselle de Fontaine
qui jouissait délicieusement de l'existence en la rapportant à un autre
qu'à elle. Elle commençait à concevoir les rapports sociaux. Soit que le
bonheur nous rende meilleurs, soit qu'elle fût trop occupée pour
tourmenter les autres, elle devint moins caustique, plus indulgente,
plus douce. Le changement de son caractère enchanta sa famille étonnée.
Peut-être, après tout, son égoïsme se métamorphosait-il en amour.
Attendre l'arrivée de son timide et secret adorateur était une joie
profonde. Sans qu'un seul mot de passion eût été prononcé entre eux,
elle se savait aimée, et avec quel art ne se plaisait-elle pas à faire
déployer au jeune inconnu les trésors d'une instruction qui se montra
variée! Elle s'aperçut qu'elle aussi était observée avec soin, et alors
elle essaya de vaincre tous les défauts que son éducation avait laissés
croître en elle. N'était-ce pas un premier hommage rendu à l'amour, et
un reproche cruel qu'elle s'adressait à elle-même? Elle voulait plaire,
elle enchanta; elle aimait, elle fut idolâtrée. Sa famille, sachant
qu'elle était gardée par son orgueil, lui donnait assez de liberté pour
qu'elle pût savourer ces petites félicités enfantines qui donnent tant
de charme et de violence aux premières amours. Plus d'une fois, le jeune
homme et mademoiselle de Fontaine se promenèrent seuls dans les allées
de ce parc où la nature était parée comme une femme qui va au bal. Plus
d'une fois, ils eurent de ces entretiens sans but ni physionomie dont
les phrases les plus vides de sens sont celles qui cachent le plus de
sentiments. Ils admirèrent souvent ensemble le soleil couchant et ses
riches couleurs. Ils cueillirent des marguerites pour les effeuiller, et
chantèrent des duos les plus passionnés en se servant des notes trouvées
par Pergolèse ou par Rossini, comme de truchements fidèles pour exprimer
leurs secrets.
Le jour du bal arriva. Clara Longueville et son frère, que les valets
s'obstinaient à décorer de la noble particule, en furent les héros. Pour
la première fois de sa vie, mademoiselle de Fontaine vit le triomphe
d'une jeune fille avec plaisir. Elle prodigua sincèrement à Clara ces
caresses gracieuses et ces petits soins que les femmes ne se rendent
ordinairement entre elles que pour exciter la jalousie des hommes. Mais
Émilie avait un but, elle voulait surprendre des secrets. La réserve de
mademoiselle Longueville fut au moins égale à celle de son frère; mais,
en sa qualité de fille, peut-être montra-t-elle plus de finesse et
d'esprit que lui, car elle n'eut pas même l'air d'être discrète et sut
tenir la conversation sur des sujets étrangers aux intérêts matériels,
tout en y jetant un si grand charme que mademoiselle de Fontaine en
conçut une sorte d'envie, et surnomma Clara _la sirène_. Quoique Émilie
eût formé le dessein de faire causer Clara, ce fut Clara qui interrogea
Émilie; elle voulait la juger, et fut jugée par elle. Elle se dépita
souvent d'avoir laissé percer son caractère dans quelques réponses que
lui arracha malicieusement Clara dont l'air modeste et candide éloignait
tout soupçon de perfidie. Il y eut un moment où mademoiselle de
Fontaine parut fâchée d'avoir fait contre les roturiers une imprudente
sortie provoquée par Clara.
--Mademoiselle, lui dit cette charmante créature, j'ai tant entendu
parler de vous par Maximilien, que j'avais le plus vif désir de vous
connaître par attachement pour lui; mais vouloir vous connaître,
n'est-ce pas vouloir vous aimer?
--Ma chère Clara, j'avais peur de vous déplaire en parlant ainsi de ceux
qui ne sont pas nobles.
--Oh! rassurez-vous. Aujourd'hui, ces sortes de discussions sont sans
objet. Quant à moi, elles ne m'atteignent pas: je suis en dehors de la
question.
Quelque ambitieuse que fût cette réponse, mademoiselle de Fontaine en
ressentit une joie profonde; car, semblable à tous les gens passionnés,
elle s'expliqua comme s'expliquent les oracles, dans le sens qui
s'accordait avec ses désirs, et revint à la danse plus joyeuse que
jamais en regardant Longueville dont les formes, dont l'élégance
surpassaient peut-être celles de son type imaginaire. Elle ressentit une
satisfaction de plus en songeant qu'il était noble, ses yeux noirs
scintillèrent, elle dansa avec tout le plaisir qu'on y trouve en
présence de celui qu'on aime. Jamais les deux amants ne s'entendirent
mieux qu'en ce moment; et plus d'une fois ils sentirent le bout de leurs
doigts frémir et trembler lorsque les lois de la contredanse les
mariaient.
Ce joli couple atteignit le commencement de l'automne au milieu des
fêtes et des plaisirs de la campagne, en se laissant doucement
abandonner au courant du sentiment le plus doux de la vie, en le
fortifiant par mille petits accidents que chacun peut imaginer: les
amours se ressemblent toujours en quelques points. L'un et l'autre, ils
s'étudiaient, autant que l'on peut s'étudier quand on aime.
--Enfin, jamais amourette n'a si promptement tourné en mariage
d'inclination, disait le vieil oncle qui suivait les deux jeunes gens de
l'oeil comme un naturaliste examine un insecte au microscope.
Ce mot effraya monsieur et madame de Fontaine. Le vieux Vendéen cessa
d'être aussi indifférent au mariage de sa fille qu'il avait naguère
promis de l'être. Il alla chercher à Paris des renseignements et n'en
trouva pas. Inquiet de ce mystère, et ne sachant pas encore quel serait
le résultat de l'enquête qu'il avait prié un administrateur parisien de
lui faire sur la famille Longueville, il crut devoir avertir sa fille de
se conduire prudemment. L'observation paternelle fut reçue avec une
feinte obéissance pleine d'ironie.
--Au moins ma chère Émilie, si vous l'aimez, ne le lui avouez pas!
--Mon père, il est vrai que je l'aime, mais j'attendrai pour le lui dire
que vous me le permettiez.
--Cependant, Émilie, songez que vous ignorez encore quelle est sa
famille, son état.
--Si je l'ignore, je le veux bien. Mais, mon père, vous avez souhaité me
voir mariée, vous m'avez donné la liberté de faire un choix, le mien est
fait irrévocablement, que faut-il de plus?
--Il faut savoir, ma chère enfant, si celui que tu as choisi est fils
d'un pair de France, répondit ironiquement le vénérable gentilhomme.
Émilie resta un moment silencieuse. Elle releva bientôt la tête, regarda
son père, et lui dit avec une sorte d'inquiétude:--Est-ce que les
Longueville?...
--Sont éteints en la personne du vieux duc de Rostein-Limbourg, qui a
péri sur l'échafaud en 1793. Il était le dernier rejeton de la dernière
branche cadette.
--Mais, mon père, il y a de fort bonnes maisons issues de bâtards.
L'histoire de France fourmille de princes qui mettaient des barres à
leur écu.
--Tes idées ont bien changé, dit le vieux gentilhomme en souriant.
Le lendemain était le dernier jour que la famille Fontaine dût passer au
pavillon Planat. Émilie, que l'avis de son père avait fortement
inquiétée, attendit avec une vive impatience l'heure à laquelle le jeune
Longueville avait l'habitude de venir, afin d'obtenir de lui une
explication. Elle sortit après le dîner et alla se promener seule dans
le parc en se dirigeant vers le bosquet aux confidences où elle savait
que l'empressé jeune homme la chercherait; et tout en courant, elle
songeait à la meilleure manière de surprendre, sans se compromettre, un
secret si important: chose assez difficile! Jusqu'à présent, aucun aveu
direct n'avait sanctionné le sentiment qui l'unissait à cet inconnu.
Elle avait secrètement joui, comme Maximilien, de la douceur d'un
premier amour, mais aussi fiers l'un que l'autre, il semblait que chacun
d'eux craignît d'avouer qu'il aimât.
Maximilien Longueville, à qui Clara avait inspiré sur le caractère
d'Émilie des soupçons assez fondés, se trouvait tour à tour emporté par
la violence d'une passion de jeune homme, et retenu par le désir de
connaître et d'éprouver la femme à laquelle il devait confier son
bonheur. Son amour ne l'avait pas empêché de reconnaître en Émilie les
préjugés qui gâtaient ce jeune caractère; mais il désirait savoir s'il
était aimé d'elle avant de les combattre, car il ne voulait pas plus
hasarder le sort de son amour que celui de sa vie. Il s'était donc
constamment tenu dans un silence que ses regards, son attitude et ses
moindres actions démentaient. De l'autre côté, la fierté naturelle à une
jeune fille, encore augmentée chez mademoiselle de Fontaine par la sotte
vanité que lui donnaient sa naissance et sa beauté, l'empêchait d'aller
au-devant d'une déclaration qu'une passion croissante lui persuadait
quelquefois de solliciter. Aussi les deux amants avaient-ils
instinctivement compris leur situation sans s'expliquer leurs secrets
motifs. Il est des moments de la vie où le vague plaît à de jeunes âmes.
Par cela même que l'un et l'autre avaient trop tardé de parler, ils
semblaient tous deux se faire un jeu cruel de leur attente. L'un
cherchait à découvrir s'il était aimé par l'effort que coûterait un aveu
à son orgueilleuse maîtresse, l'autre espérait voir rompre à tout moment
un trop respectueux silence.
Assise sur un banc rustique, Émilie songeait aux événements qui venaient
de se passer pendant ces trois mois pleins d'enchantements. Les soupçons
de son père étaient les dernières craintes qui pouvaient l'atteindre,
elle en fit même justice par deux ou trois de ces réflexions de jeune
fille inexpérimentée qui lui semblèrent victorieuses. Avant tout, elle
convint avec elle-même qu'il était impossible qu'elle se trompât. Durant
toute la saison, elle n'avait pu apercevoir en Maximilien, ni un seul
geste, ni une seule parole qui indiquassent une origine ou des
occupations communes; bien mieux, sa manière de discuter décelait un
homme occupé des hauts intérêts du pays.--D'ailleurs, se dit-elle, un
homme de bureau, un financier ou un commerçant n'aurait pas eu le loisir
de rester une saison entière à me faire la cour au milieu des champs et
des bois, en dispensant son temps aussi libéralement qu'un noble qui a
devant lui toute une vie libre de soins. Elle s'abandonnait au cours
d'une méditation beaucoup plus intéressante pour elle que ces pensées
préliminaires, quand un léger bruissement du feuillage lui annonça que
depuis un moment Maximilien la contemplait sans doute avec admiration.
--Savez-vous que cela est fort mal de surprendre ainsi les jeunes
filles? lui dit-elle en souriant.
--Surtout lorsqu'elles sont occupées de leurs secrets, répondit finement
Maximilien.
--Pourquoi n'aurais-je pas les miens? vous avez bien les vôtres!
--Vous pensiez donc réellement à vos secrets? reprit-il en riant.
--Non, je songeais aux vôtres. Les miens, je les connais.
--Mais, s'écria doucement le jeune homme en saisissant le bras de
mademoiselle de Fontaine et le mettant sous le sien, peut-être mes
secrets sont-ils les vôtres, et vos secrets les miens.
Après avoir fait quelques pas, ils se trouvèrent sous un massif d'arbres
que les couleurs du couchant enveloppaient comme d'un nuage rouge et
brun. Cette magie naturelle imprima une sorte de solennité à ce moment.
L'action vive et libre du jeune homme, et surtout l'agitation de son
coeur bouillant dont les pulsations précipitées parlaient au bras
d'Émilie, la jetèrent dans une exaltation d'autant plus pénétrante
qu'elle ne fut excitée que par les accidents les plus simples et les
plus innocents. La réserve dans laquelle vivent les jeunes filles du
grand monde donne une force incroyable aux explosions de leurs
sentiments, et c'est un des plus grands dangers qui puissent les
atteindre quand elles rencontrent un amant passionné. Jamais les yeux
d'Émilie et de Maximilien n'avaient dit tant de ces choses qu'on n'ose
pas dire. En proie à cette ivresse, ils oublièrent aisément les petites
stipulations de l'orgueil et les froides considérations de la défiance.
Ils ne purent même s'exprimer d'abord que par un serrement de mains qui
servit d'interprète à leurs joyeuses pensées.
--Monsieur, j'ai une question à vous faire, dit en tremblant et d'une
voix émue mademoiselle de Fontaine après un long silence et après avoir
fait quelques pas avec une certaine lenteur. Mais songez, de grâce,
qu'elle m'est en quelque sorte commandée par la situation assez étrange
où je me trouve vis-à-vis de ma famille.
Une pause effrayante pour Émilie succéda à ces phrases qu'elle avait
presque bégayées. Pendant le moment que dura le silence, cette jeune
fille si fière n'osa soutenir le regard éclatant de celui qu'elle
aimait, car elle avait un secret sentiment de la bassesse des mots
suivants qu'elle ajouta:--Êtes-vous noble?
Quand ces dernières paroles furent prononcées, elle aurait voulu être au
fond d'un lac.
--Mademoiselle, reprit gravement Longueville dont la figure altérée
contracta une sorte de dignité sévère, je vous promets de répondre sans
détour à cette demande quand vous aurez répondu avec sincérité à celle
que je vais vous faire. Il quitta le bras de la jeune fille, qui tout à
coup se crut seule dans la vie et lui dit:--Dans quelle intention me
questionnez-vous sur ma naissance? Elle demeura immobile, froide et
muette.--Mademoiselle, reprit Maximilien, n'allons pas plus loin si nous
ne nous comprenons pas.--Je vous aime, ajouta-t-il d'un son de voix
profond et attendri. Eh bien! reprit-il d'un air joyeux après avoir
entendu l'exclamation de bonheur que ne put retenir la jeune fille,
pourquoi me demander si je suis noble?
--Parlerait-il ainsi s'il ne l'était pas? s'écria une voix intérieure
qu'Émilie crut sortie du fond de son coeur. Elle releva gracieusement la
tête, sembla puiser une nouvelle vie dans le regard du jeune homme et
lui tendit le bras comme pour faire une nouvelle alliance.
--Vous avez cru que je tenais beaucoup à des dignités, demanda-t-elle
avec une finesse malicieuse.
--Je n'ai pas de titres à offrir à ma femme, répondit-il d'un air moitié
gai, moitié sérieux. Mais si je la prends dans un haut rang et parmi
celles que la fortune paternelle habitue au luxe et aux plaisirs de
l'opulence, je sais à quoi ce choix m'oblige. L'amour donne tout,
ajouta-t-il avec gaieté, mais aux amants seulement. Quant aux époux, il
leur faut un peu plus que le dôme du ciel et le tapis des prairies.
--Il est riche, pensa-t-elle. Quant aux titres, peut-être veut-il
m'éprouver! On lui aura dit que j'étais entichée de noblesse, et que je
ne voulais épouser qu'un pair de France. Mes bégueules de soeurs
m'auront joué ce tour-là.--Je vous assure, monsieur, dit-elle à haute
voix, que j'ai eu des idées bien exagérées sur la vie et le monde; mais
aujourd'hui, reprit-elle avec intention en le regardant d'une manière à
le rendre fou, je sais où sont pour une femme les véritables richesses.
--J'ai besoin de croire que vous parlez à coeur ouvert, répondit-il avec
une gravité douce. Mais cet hiver, ma chère Émilie, dans moins de deux
mois peut-être, je serai fier de ce que je pourrai vous offrir, si vous
tenez aux jouissances de la fortune. Ce sera le seul secret que je
garderai là, dit-il en montrant son coeur; car de sa réussite dépend mon
bonheur, je n'ose dire le nôtre...
--Oh dites, dites!
Ce fut au milieu des plus doux propos qu'ils revinrent à pas lents
rejoindre la compagnie au salon. Jamais mademoiselle de Fontaine ne
trouva son prétendu plus aimable, ni plus spirituel: ses formes sveltes,
ses manières engageantes lui semblèrent plus charmantes encore depuis
une conversation qui venait en quelque sorte de lui confirmer la
possession d'un coeur digne d'être envié par toutes les femmes. Ils
chantèrent un duo italien avec tant d'expression, que l'assemblée les
applaudit avec enthousiasme. Leur adieu prit un accent de convention
sous lequel ils cachèrent leur bonheur. Enfin, cette journée devint pour
la jeune fille comme une chaîne qui la lia plus étroitement encore à la
destinée de l'inconnu. La force et la dignité qu'il venait de déployer
dans la scène où ils s'étaient révélé leurs sentiments avaient peut-être
imposé à mademoiselle de Fontaine ce respect sans lequel il n'existe pas
de véritable amour. Lorsqu'elle resta seule avec son père dans le salon,
le vénérable Vendéen s'avança vers elle, lui prit affectueusement les
mains, et lui demanda si elle avait acquis quelque lumière sur la
fortune et sur la famille de monsieur Longueville.
--Oui, mon cher père, répondit-elle, je suis plus heureuse que je ne
pouvais le désirer. Enfin monsieur de Longueville est le seul homme que
je veuille épouser.
--C'est bien, Émilie, reprit le comte, je sais ce qu'il me reste à
faire.
--Connaîtriez-vous quelque obstacle? demanda-t-elle avec une véritable
anxiété.
--Ma chère enfant, ce jeune homme est absolument inconnu; mais, à moins
que ce ne soit un malhonnête homme, du moment où tu l'aimes, il m'est
aussi cher qu'un fils.
--Un malhonnête homme? reprit Émilie, je suis bien tranquille. Mon
oncle, qui nous l'a présenté, peut vous répondre de lui. Dites, cher
oncle, a-t-il été flibustier, forban, corsaire?
--Je savais bien que j'allais me trouver là, s'écria le vieux marin en
se réveillant.
Il regarda dans le salon, mais sa nièce avait disparu comme un feu
Saint-Elme, pour se servir de son expression habituelle.
--Eh bien mon oncle! reprit monsieur de Fontaine, comment avez-vous pu
nous cacher tout ce que vous saviez sur ce jeune homme? Vous avez
cependant dû vous apercevoir de nos inquiétudes. Monsieur de Longueville
est-il de bonne famille?
--Je ne le connais ni d'Ève ni d'Adam, s'écria le comte de Kergarouët.
Me fiant au tact de cette petite folle, je lui ai amené son Saint-Preux
par un moyen à moi connu. Je sais que ce garçon tire le pistolet
admirablement, chasse très-bien, joue merveilleusement au billard, aux
échecs et au trictrac; il fait des armes et monte à cheval comme feu le
chevalier de Saint-Georges. Il a une érudition corsée relativement à nos
vignobles. Il calcule comme Barême, dessine, danse et chante bien. Eh!
diantre, qu'avez-vous donc, vous autres? Si ce n'est pas là un
gentilhomme parfait, montrez-moi un bourgeois qui sache tout cela,
trouvez-moi un homme qui vive aussi noblement que lui? Fait-il quelque
chose? Compromet-il sa dignité à aller dans des bureaux, à se courber
devant des parvenus que vous appelez des directeurs-généraux? Il marche
droit. C'est un homme. Mais, au surplus, je viens de retrouver dans la
poche de mon gilet la carte qu'il m'a donnée quand il croyait que je
voulais lui couper la gorge, pauvre innocent! La jeunesse d'aujourd'hui
n'est guère rusée. Tenez, voici.
--Rue du Sentier, nº 5, dit monsieur de Fontaine en cherchant à se
rappeler parmi tous les renseignements qu'il avait obtenus celui qui
pouvait concerner le jeune inconnu. Que diable cela signifie-t-il?
Messieurs Palma, Werbrust et compagnie, dont le principal commerce est
celui des mousselines, calicots et toiles peintes en gros, demeurent là.
Bon, j'y suis! Longueville, le député, a un intérêt dans leur maison.
Oui; mais je ne connais à Longueville qu'un fils de trente-deux ans, qui
ne ressemble pas du tout au nôtre et auquel il donne cinquante mille
livres de rente en mariage afin de lui faire épouser la fille d'un
ministre; il a envie d'être fait pair tout comme un autre. Jamais je ne
lui ai entendu parler de ce Maximilien. A-t-il une fille? Qu'est-ce que
cette Clara? Au surplus, permis à plus d'un intrigant de s'appeler
Longueville. Mais la maison Palma, Werbrust et compagnie n'est-elle pas
à moitié ruinée par une spéculation au Mexique ou aux Indes?
J'éclaircirai tout cela.
--Tu parles tout seul comme si tu étais sur un théâtre, et tu parais me
compter pour zéro, dit tout à coup le vieux marin. Tu ne sais donc pas
que s'il est gentilhomme, j'ai plus d'un sac dans ces écoutilles pour
parer à son défaut de fortune?
--Quant à cela, s'il est fils de Longueville, il n'a besoin de rien;
mais, dit monsieur de Fontaine en agitant la tête de droite à gauche,
son père n'a pas même acheté de savonnette à vilain. Avant la
révolution, il était procureur; et le _de_ qu'il a pris depuis la
restauration lui appartient tout autant que la moitié de sa fortune.
--Bah! bah! heureux ceux dont les pères ont été pendus, s'écria gaiement
le marin.
Trois ou quatre jours après cette mémorable journée, et dans une de ces
belles matinées du mois de novembre qui font voir aux Parisiens leurs
boulevards nettoyés soudain par le froid piquant d'une première gelée,
mademoiselle de Fontaine, parée d'une fourrure nouvelle qu'elle voulait
mettre à la mode, était sortie avec deux de ses belles-soeurs sur
lesquelles elle avait jadis décoché le plus d'épigrammes. Ces trois
femmes étaient bien moins invitées à cette promenade parisienne par
l'envie d'essayer une voiture très-élégante et des robes qui devaient
donner le ton aux modes de l'hiver que par le désir de voir une pèlerine
qu'une de leurs amies avait remarquée dans un riche magasin de lingerie
situé au coin de la rue de la Paix. Quand les trois dames furent entrées
dans la boutique, madame la baronne de Fontaine tira Émilie par la
manche et lui montra Maximilien Longueville assis dans le comptoir et
occupé à rendre avec une grâce mercantile la monnaie d'une pièce d'or à
la lingère avec laquelle il semblait en conférence. Le _bel inconnu_
tenait à la main quelques échantillons qui ne laissaient aucun doute sur
son honorable profession. Sans qu'on pût s'en apercevoir, Émilie fut
saisie d'un frisson glacial. Cependant, grâce au savoir-vivre de la
bonne compagnie, elle dissimula parfaitement la rage qu'elle avait dans
le coeur, et répondit à sa soeur un:--Je le savais! dont la richesse
d'intonation et l'accent inimitable eussent fait envie à la plus célèbre
actrice de ce temps. Elle s'avança vers le comptoir. Longueville leva la
tête, mit les échantillons dans sa poche avec grâce et avec un
sang-froid désespérant, salua mademoiselle de Fontaine et s'approcha
d'elle en lui jetant un regard pénétrant.
--Mademoiselle, dit-il à la lingère qui l'avait suivi d'un air
très-inquiet, j'enverrai régler ce compte; ma maison le veut ainsi.
Mais, tenez, ajouta-t-il à l'oreille de la jeune femme en lui remettant
un billet de mille francs, prenez: ce sera une affaire entre nous.--Vous
me pardonnerez, j'espère, mademoiselle, dit-il en se retournant vers
Émilie. Vous aurez la bonté d'excuser la tyrannie qu'exercent les
affaires.
--Mais il me semble, monsieur, que cela m'est fort indifférent, répondit
mademoiselle de Fontaine en le regardant avec une assurance et un air
d'insouciance moqueuse qui pouvaient faire croire qu'elle le voyait pour
la première fois.
--Parlez-vous sérieusement? demanda Maximilien d'une voix entrecoupée.
Émilie lui avait tourné le dos avec une incroyable impertinence. Ce peu
de mots, prononcés à voix basse, avaient échappé à la curiosité des deux
belles-soeurs. Quand, après avoir pris la pèlerine, les trois dames
furent remontées en voiture, Émilie, qui se trouvait assise sur le
devant, ne put s'empêcher d'embrasser par son dernier regard la
profondeur de cette odieuse boutique où elle vit Maximilien debout et
les bras croisés, dans l'attitude d'un homme supérieur au malheur qui
l'atteignait si subitement. Leurs yeux se rencontrèrent et se lancèrent
deux regards implacables. Chacun d'eux espéra qu'il blessait cruellement
le coeur qu'il aimait. En un moment tous deux se trouvèrent aussi loin
l'un de l'autre que s'ils eussent été, l'un à la Chine et l'autre au
Groënland. La vanité n'a-t-elle pas un souffle qui dessèche tout? En
proie au plus violent combat qui puisse agiter le coeur d'une jeune
fille, mademoiselle de Fontaine recueillit la plus ample moisson de
douleurs que jamais les préjugés et les petitesses aient semée dans une
âme humaine. Son visage, frais et velouté naguère, était sillonné de
tons jaunes, de taches rouges, et parfois les teintes blanches de ses
joues verdissaient soudain. Dans l'espoir de dérober son trouble à ses
soeurs, elle leur montrait en riant ou un passant ou une toilette
ridicule; mais ce rire était convulsif. Elle se sentait plus vivement
blessée de la compassion silencieuse de ses soeurs que des épigrammes
par lesquelles elles auraient pu se venger. Elle employa tout son esprit
à les entraîner dans une conversation où elle essaya d'exhaler sa colère
par des paradoxes insensés, en accablant les négociants des injures les
plus piquantes et d'épigrammes de mauvais ton. En rentrant, elle fut
saisie d'une fièvre dont le caractère eut d'abord quelque chose de
dangereux. Au bout d'un mois, les soins des parents, ceux du médecin, la
rendirent aux voeux de sa famille. Chacun espéra que cette leçon
pourrait servir à dompter le caractère d'Émilie, qui reprit
insensiblement ses anciennes habitudes et s'élança de nouveau dans le
monde. Elle prétendit qu'il n'y avait pas de honte à se tromper. Si,
comme son père, elle avait quelque influence à la chambre, disait-elle,
elle provoquerait une loi pour obtenir que les commerçants, surtout les
marchands de calicot, fussent marqués au front comme les moutons du
Berri, jusqu'à la troisième génération. Elle voulait que les nobles
eussent seuls le droit de porter ces anciens habits français qui
allaient si bien aux courtisans de Louis XV. C'était peut-être, à
l'entendre, un malheur pour la monarchie qu'il n'y eût aucune différence
entre un marchand et un pair de France. Mille autres plaisanteries,
faciles à deviner, se succédaient rapidement quand un accident imprévu
la mettait sur ce sujet. Mais ceux qui aimaient Émilie remarquaient à
travers ses railleries une teinte de mélancolie qui leur fit croire que
Maximilien Longueville régnait toujours au fond de ce coeur
inexplicable. Parfois elle devenait douce comme pendant la saison
fugitive qui vit naître son amour, et parfois aussi elle se montrait
plus insupportable qu'elle ne l'avait jamais été. Chacun excusait en
silence les inégalités d'une humeur qui prenait sa source dans une
souffrance à la fois secrète et connue. Le comte de Kergarouët obtint un
peu d'empire sur elle, grâce à un surcroît de prodigalités, genre de
consolation qui manque rarement son effet sur les jeunes Parisiennes. La
première fois que mademoiselle de Fontaine alla au bal, ce fut chez
l'ambassadeur de Naples. Au moment où elle prit place au plus brillant
des quadrilles, elle aperçut à quelques pas d'elle Longueville qui fit
un léger signe de tête à son danseur.
--Ce jeune homme est un de vos amis? demanda-t-elle à son cavalier d'un
air de dédain.
--C'est mon frère, répondit-il.
Émilie ne put s'empêcher de tressaillir.
--Ah! reprit-il d'un ton d'enthousiasme, c'est bien la plus belle âme
qui soit au monde...
--Savez-vous mon nom? lui demanda Émilie en l'interrompant avec
vivacité.
--Non, mademoiselle. C'est un crime, je l'avoue, de ne pas avoir retenu
un nom qui est sur toutes les lèvres, je devrais dire dans tous les
coeurs; mais j'ai une excuse valable: j'arrive d'Allemagne. Mon
ambassadeur, qui est à Paris en congé, m'a envoyé ce soir ici pour
servir de chaperon à son aimable femme, que vous pouvez voir là-bas dans
un coin.
--Un vrai masque tragique, dit Émilie après avoir examiné
l'ambassadrice.
--Voilà cependant sa figure de bal, reprit en riant le jeune homme. Il
faudra bien que je la fasse danser! Aussi ai-je voulu avoir une
compensation.
Mademoiselle de Fontaine s'inclina.
--J'ai été bien surpris, dit le babillard secrétaire d'ambassade en
continuant, de trouver mon frère ici. En arrivant de Vienne, j'ai appris
que le pauvre garçon était malade et au lit. Je comptais bien le voir
avant d'aller au bal; mais la politique ne nous laisse pas toujours le
loisir d'avoir des affections de famille. La _padrona della casa_ ne m'a
pas permis de monter chez mon pauvre Maximilien.
--Monsieur votre frère n'est pas comme vous dans la diplomatie? dit
Émilie.
--Non, dit le secrétaire en soupirant, le pauvre garçon s'est sacrifié
pour moi! Lui et ma soeur Clara ont renoncé à la fortune de mon père,
afin qu'il pût réunir sur ma tête un majorat. Mon père rêve la pairie
comme tous ceux qui votent pour le ministère. Il a la promesse d'être
nommé, ajouta-t-il à voix basse. Après avoir réuni quelques capitaux,
mon frère s'est alors associé à une maison de banque; et je sais qu'il
vient de faire avec le Brésil une spéculation qui peut le rendre
millionnaire. Vous me voyez tout joyeux d'avoir contribué par mes
relations diplomatiques au succès. J'attends même avec impatience une
dépêche de la légation brésilienne qui sera de nature à lui dérider le
front. Comment le trouvez-vous?
--Mais la figure de monsieur votre frère ne me semble pas être celle
d'un homme occupé d'argent.
Le jeune diplomate scruta par un seul regard la figure en apparence
calme de sa danseuse.
--Comment! dit-il en souriant, les demoiselles devinent donc aussi les
pensées d'amour à travers les fronts muets?
--Monsieur votre frère est amoureux? demanda-t-elle en laissant échapper
un geste de curiosité.
--Oui. Ma soeur Clara, pour laquelle il a des soins maternels, m'a écrit
qu'il s'était amouraché, cet été, d'une fort jolie personne, mais depuis
je n'ai pas eu de nouvelles de ses amours. Croiriez-vous que le pauvre
garçon se levait à cinq heures du matin, et allait expédier ses affaires
afin de pouvoir se trouver à quatre heures à la campagne de la belle?
Aussi a-t-il abîmé un charmant cheval de race que je lui avais envoyé.
Pardonnez-moi mon babil, mademoiselle: j'arrive d'Allemagne. Depuis un
an je n'ai pas entendu parler correctement le français, je suis sevré de
visages français et rassasié d'allemands, si bien que dans ma rage
patriotique je parlerais, je crois, aux chimères d'un candélabre
parisien. Puis, si je cause avec un abandon peu convenable chez un
diplomate, la faute en est à vous, mademoiselle. N'est-ce pas vous qui
m'avez montré mon frère? Quand il est question de lui, je suis
intarissable. Je voudrais pouvoir dire à la terre tout entière combien
il est bon et généreux. Il ne s'agissait de rien moins que de cent mille
livres de rente que rapporte la terre de Longueville.
Si mademoiselle de Fontaine obtint ces révélations importantes, elle les
dut en partie à l'adresse avec laquelle elle sut interroger son confiant
cavalier, du moment où elle apprit qu'il était le frère de son amant
dédaigné.
--Est-ce que vous avez pu, sans quelque peine, voir monsieur votre frère
vendant des mousselines et des calicots? demanda Émilie après avoir
accompli la troisième figure de la contredanse.
--D'où savez-vous cela? lui demanda le diplomate. Dieu merci! tout en
débitant un flux de paroles, j'ai déjà l'art de ne dire que ce que je
veux, ainsi que tous les apprentis-diplomates de ma connaissance.
--Vous me l'avez dit, je vous assure.
Monsieur de Longueville regarda mademoiselle de Fontaine avec un
étonnement plein de perspicacité. Un soupçon entra dans son âme. Il
interrogea successivement les yeux de son frère et de sa danseuse, il
devina tout, pressa ses mains l'une contre l'autre, leva les yeux au
plafond, se mit à rire et dit:--Je ne suis qu'un sot! Vous êtes la plus
belle personne du bal, mon frère vous regarde à la dérobée, il danse
malgré la fièvre, et vous feignez de ne pas le voir. Faites son bonheur,
dit-il en la reconduisant auprès de son vieil oncle, je n'en serai pas
jaloux; mais je tressaillerai toujours un peu en vous nommant ma
soeur...
Cependant les deux amants devaient être aussi inexorables l'un que
l'autre pour eux-mêmes. Vers les deux heures du matin, l'on servit un
ambigu dans une immense galerie où, pour laisser les personnes d'une
même coterie libres de se réunir, les tables avaient été disposées comme
elles le sont chez les restaurateurs. Par un de ces hasards qui arrivent
toujours aux amants, mademoiselle de Fontaine se trouva placée à une
table voisine de celle autour de laquelle se mirent les personnes les
plus distinguées. Maximilien faisait partie de ce groupe. Émilie, qui
prêta une oreille attentive aux discours tenus par ses voisins, put
entendre une de ces conversations qui s'établissent si facilement entre
les jeunes femmes et les jeunes gens qui ont les grâces et la tournure
de Maximilien Longueville. L'interlocutrice du jeune banquier était une
duchesse napolitaine dont les yeux lançaient des éclairs, dont la peau
blanche avait l'éclat du satin. L'intimité que le jeune Longueville
affectait d'avoir avec elle blessa d'autant plus mademoiselle de
Fontaine qu'elle venait de rendre à son amant vingt fois plus de
tendresse qu'elle ne lui en portait jadis.
--Oui, monsieur, dans mon pays, le véritable amour sait faire toute
espèce de sacrifices, disait la duchesse en minaudant.
--Vous êtes plus passionnées que ne le sont les Françaises, dit
Maximilien dont le regard enflammé tomba sur Émilie. Elles sont tout
vanité.
--Monsieur, reprit vivement la jeune fille, n'est-ce pas une mauvaise
action que de calomnier sa patrie? Le dévouement est de tous les pays.
--Croyez-vous, mademoiselle, reprit l'Italienne avec un sourire
sardonique, qu'une Parisienne soit capable de suivre son amant partout?
--Ah! entendons-nous, madame. On va dans un désert y habiter une tente,
on ne va pas s'asseoir dans une boutique.
Elle acheva sa pensée en laissant échapper un geste de dédain. Ainsi
l'influence exercée sur Émilie par sa funeste éducation tua deux fois
son bonheur naissant, et lui fit manquer son existence. La froideur
apparente de Maximilien et le sourire d'une femme lui arrachèrent un de
ces sarcasmes dont les perfides jouissances la séduisaient toujours.
--Mademoiselle, lui dit à voix basse Longueville à la faveur du bruit
que firent les femmes en se levant de table, personne ne formera pour
votre bonheur des voeux plus ardents que ne le seront les miens:
permettez-moi de vous donner cette assurance en prenant congé de vous.
Dans quelques jours, je partirai pour l'Italie.
--Avec une duchesse, sans doute?
--Non, mademoiselle, mais avec une maladie mortelle peut être.
--N'est-ce pas une chimère? demanda Émilie en lui lançant un regard
inquiet.
--Non, dit-il, il est des blessures qui ne se cicatrisent jamais.
--Vous ne partirez pas, dit l'impérieuse jeune fille en souriant.
--Je partirai, reprit gravement Maximilien.
--Vous me trouverez mariée au retour, je vous en préviens, dit-elle avec
coquetterie.
--Je le souhaite.
--L'impertinent! s'écria-t-elle, se venge-t-il assez cruellement!
Quinze jours après, Maximilien Longueville partit avec sa soeur Clara
pour les chaudes et poétiques contrées de la belle Italie, laissant
mademoiselle de Fontaine en proie aux plus violents regrets. Le jeune
secrétaire d'ambassade épousa la querelle de son frère, et sut tirer une
vengeance éclatante des dédains d'Émilie en publiant les motifs de la
rupture des deux amants. Il rendit avec usure à sa danseuse les
sarcasmes qu'elle avait jadis lancés sur Maximilien, et fit souvent
sourire plus d'une Excellence en peignant la belle ennemie des
comptoirs, l'amazone qui prêchait une croisade contre les banquiers, la
jeune fille dont l'amour s'était évaporé devant un demi-tiers de
mousseline. Le comte de Fontaine fut obligé d'user de son crédit pour
faire obtenir à Auguste Longueville une mission en Russie, afin de
soustraire sa fille au ridicule que ce jeune et dangereux persécuteur
versait sur elle à pleines mains. Bientôt le ministère, obligé de lever
une conscription de pairs pour soutenir les opinions aristocratiques qui
chancelaient dans la noble chambre à la voix d'un illustre écrivain,
nomma monsieur _Guiraudin_ de Longueville pair de France et vicomte.
Monsieur de Fontaine obtint aussi la pairie, récompense due autant à sa
fidélité pendant les mauvais jours qu'à son nom qui manquait à la
chambre héréditaire.
Vers cette époque, Émilie devenue majeure fit sans doute de sérieuses
réflexions sur la vie; car elle changea sensiblement de ton et de
manières: au lieu de s'exercer à dire des méchancetés à son oncle, elle
lui prodigua les soins les plus affectueux, elle lui apportait sa
béquille avec une persévérance de tendresse qui faisait rire les
plaisants; elle lui offrait le bras, allait dans sa voiture, et
l'accompagnait dans toutes ses promenades; elle lui persuada même
qu'elle n'était point incommodée par l'odeur de la pipe, et lui lisait
sa chère _Quotidienne_ au milieu des bouffées de tabac que le malicieux
marin lui envoyait à dessein; elle apprit le piquet pour faire la partie
du vieux comte; enfin cette jeune personne si fantasque écoutait avec
attention les récits que son oncle recommençait périodiquement du combat
de _la Belle-Poule_, des manoeuvres de _la Ville-de-Paris_, de la
première expédition de monsieur de Suffren, ou de la bataille d'Aboukir.
Quoique le vieux marin eût souvent dit qu'il connaissait trop sa
longitude et sa latitude pour se laisser capturer par une jeune
corvette, un beau matin les salons de Paris apprirent que mademoiselle
de Fontaine avait épousé le comte de Kergarouët. La jeune comtesse donna
des fêtes splendides pour s'étourdir; mais elle trouva sans doute le
néant au fond de ce tourbillon. Le luxe cachait imparfaitement le vide
et le malheur de son âme souffrante. La plupart du temps, malgré les
éclats d'une gaieté feinte, sa belle figure exprimait une sourde
mélancolie. Émilie paraissait d'ailleurs pleine d'attentions et d'égards
pour son vieux mari, qui souvent, en s'en allant dans son appartement le
soir au bruit d'un joyeux orchestre, disait qu'il ne se reconnaissait
plus, et qu'il ne croyait pas qu'à l'âge de soixante-douze ans il dût
s'embarquer comme pilote sur LA BELLE ÉMILIE, après avoir déjà fait
vingt ans de galères conjugales.
La conduite de la comtesse était empreinte d'une telle sévérité, que la
critique la plus clairvoyante n'avait rien à y reprendre. Les
observateurs pensaient que le vice-amiral s'était réservé le droit de
disposer de sa fortune pour enchaîner plus fortement sa femme. Cette
supposition faisait injure à l'oncle et à la nièce. L'attitude des deux
époux fut d'ailleurs si savamment calculée, qu'il devint presque
impossible aux jeunes gens intéressés à deviner le secret de ce ménage,
de savoir si le vieux comte traitait sa femme en époux ou en père. On
lui entendait dire souvent qu'il avait recueilli sa nièce comme une
naufragée, et que, jadis, il n'avait jamais abusé de l'hospitalité
quand il lui arrivait de sauver un ennemi de la fureur des orages.
Quoique la comtesse aspirât à régner sur Paris et qu'elle essayât de
marcher de pair avec mesdames les duchesses de Maufrigneuse, de
Chaulieu, les marquises d'Espard et d'Aiglemont, les comtesses Féraud,
de Montcornet, de Restaud, madame de Camps et mademoiselle Des Touches,
elle ne céda point à l'amour du jeune vicomte de Portenduère qui fit
d'elle son idole.
Deux ans après son mariage, dans un des antiques salons du faubourg
Saint-Germain où l'on admirait son caractère digne des anciens temps,
Émilie entendit annoncer monsieur le vicomte de Longueville; et dans le
coin du salon où elle faisait le piquet de l'évêque de Persépolis, son
émotion ne put être remarquée de personne: en tournant la tête, elle
avait vu entrer son ancien prétendu dans tout l'éclat de la jeunesse. La
mort de son père et celle de son frère tué par l'inclémence du climat de
Pétersbourg, avaient posé sur la tête de Maximilien les plumes
héréditaires du chapeau de la pairie; sa fortune égalait ses
connaissances et son mérite: la veille même, sa jeune et bouillante
éloquence avait éclairé l'assemblée. En ce moment, il apparaissait à la
triste comtesse, libre et paré de tous les dons qu'elle avait rêvés pour
son idole. Toutes les mères qui avaient des filles à marier faisaient de
coquettes avances à un jeune homme doué des vertus qu'on lui supposait
en admirant sa grâce; mais mieux que toute autre, Émilie savait qu'il
possédait cette fermeté de caractère dans laquelle les femmes prudentes
voient un gage de bonheur. Elle jeta les yeux sur l'amiral, qui selon
son expression familière paraissait devoir tenir encore long-temps sur
son bord, et maudit les erreurs de son enfance.
En ce moment, monsieur de Persépolis lui dit avec sa grâce
épiscopale:--Ma belle dame, vous avez écarté le roi de coeur, j'ai
gagné. Mais ne regrettez pas votre argent, je le réserve pour mes petits
séminaires.
  Paris, décembre 1829.

LA BOURSE.
  A SOFKA.
  _N'avez-vous pas remarqué, Mademoiselle, qu'en mettant deux figures en
  adoration aux côtés d'une belle sainte, les peintres ou les sculpteurs
  ne manquaient jamais de leur imprimer une ressemblance filiale? En
  voyant votre nom parmi ceux qui me sont chers et sous la protection
  desquels je place mes oeuvres, souvenez-vous de cette touchante
  harmonie, et vous trouverez ici moins un hommage que l'expression de
  l'affection fraternelle que vous a vouée_
  _Votre serviteur_,
  DE BALZAC.
Il est pour les âmes faciles à s'épanouir une heure délicieuse qui
survient au moment où la nuit n'est pas encore et où le jour n'est plus.
La lueur crépusculaire jette alors ses teintes molles ou ses reflets
bizarres sur tous les objets, et favorise une rêverie qui se marie
vaguement aux jeux de la lumière et de l'ombre. Le silence qui règne
presque toujours en cet instant le rend plus particulièrement cher aux
artistes qui se recueillent, se mettent à quelques pas de leurs oeuvres
auxquelles ils ne peuvent plus travailler, et ils les jugent en
s'enivrant du sujet dont le sens intime éclate alors aux yeux intérieurs
du génie. Celui qui n'est pas demeuré pensif près d'un ami pendant ce
moment de songes poétiques, en comprendra difficilement les indicibles
bénéfices. A la faveur du clair-obscur, les ruses matérielles employées
par l'art pour faire croire à des réalités disparaissent entièrement.
S'il s'agit d'un tableau, les personnages qu'il représente semblent et
parler et marcher: l'ombre devient ombre, le jour est jour, la chair est
vivante, les yeux remuent, le sang coule dans les veines, et les étoffes
chatoient. L'imagination aide au naturel de chaque détail et ne voit
plus que les beautés de l'oeuvre. A cette heure, l'illusion règne
despotiquement: peut-être se lève-t-elle avec la nuit! l'illusion
n'est-elle pas pour la pensée une espèce de nuit que nous meublons de
songes? L'illusion déploie alors ses ailes, elle emporte l'âme dans le
monde des fantaisies, monde fertile en voluptueux caprices et où
l'artiste oublie le monde positif, la veille et le lendemain, l'avenir,
tout jusqu'à ses misères, les bonnes comme les mauvaises. A cette heure
de magie, un jeune peintre, homme de talent, et qui dans l'art ne voyait
que l'art même, était monté sur la double échelle qui lui servait à
peindre une grande, une haute toile presque terminée. Là, se critiquant,
s'admirant avec bonne foi, nageant au cours de ses pensées, il s'abîmait
dans une de ces méditations qui ravissent l'âme et la grandissent, la
caressent et la consolent. Sa rêverie dura longtemps sans doute. La nuit
vint. Soit qu'il voulût descendre de son échelle, soit qu'il eût fait un
mouvement imprudent en se croyant sur le plancher, l'événement ne lui
permit pas d'avoir un souvenir exact des causes de son accident, il
tomba, sa tête porta sur un tabouret, il perdit connaissance et resta
sans mouvement pendant un laps de temps dont la durée lui fut inconnue.
Une douce voix le tira de l'espèce d'engourdissement dans lequel il
était plongé. Lorsqu'il ouvrit les yeux, la vue d'une vive lumière les
lui fit refermer promptement; mais à travers le voile qui enveloppait
ses sens, il entendit le chuchotement de deux femmes, et sentit deux
jeunes, deux timides mains entre lesquelles reposait sa tête. Il reprit
bientôt connaissance et put apercevoir, à la lueur d'une de ces vieilles
lampes dites _à double courant d'air_, la plus délicieuse tête de jeune
fille qu'il eût jamais vue, une de ces têtes qui souvent passent pour un
caprice du pinceau, mais qui tout à coup réalisa pour lui les théories
de ce beau idéal que se crée chaque artiste et d'où procède son talent.
Le visage de l'inconnue appartenait, pour ainsi dire, au type fin et
délicat de l'école de Prudhon, et possédait aussi cette poésie que
Girodet donnait à ses figures fantastiques. La fraîcheur des tempes, la
régularité des sourcils, la pureté des lignes, la virginité fortement
empreinte dans tous les traits de cette physionomie faisaient de la
jeune fille une création accomplie. La taille était souple et mince, les
formes étaient frêles. Ses vêtements, quoique simples et propres,
n'annonçaient ni fortune ni misère. En reprenant possession de lui-même,
le peintre exprima son admiration par un regard de surprise, et balbutia
de confus remercîments. Il trouva son front pressé par un mouchoir, et
reconnut, malgré l'odeur particulière aux ateliers, la senteur forte de
l'éther, sans doute employé pour le tirer de son évanouissement. Puis,
il finit par voir une vieille femme, qui ressemblait aux marquises de
l'ancien régime, et qui tenait la lampe en donnant des conseils à la
jeune inconnue.
--Monsieur, répondit la jeune fille à l'une des demandes faites par le
peintre pendant le moment où il était encore en proie à tout le vague
que la chute avait produit dans ses idées, ma mère et moi, nous avons
entendu le bruit de votre corps sur le plancher, nous avons cru
distinguer un gémissement. Le silence qui a succédé à la chute nous a
effrayées, et nous nous sommes empressées de monter. En trouvant la clef
sur la porte, nous nous sommes heureusement permis d'entrer, et nous
vous avons aperçu étendu par terre, sans mouvement. Ma mère a été
chercher tout ce qu'il fallait pour faire une compresse et vous ranimer.
Vous êtes blessé au front, là, sentez-vous!
--Oui, maintenant, dit-il.
--Oh! cela ne sera rien, reprit la vieille mère. Votre tête a, par
bonheur, porté sur ce mannequin.
--Je me sens infiniment mieux, répondit le peintre, je n'ai plus besoin
que d'une voiture pour retourner chez moi. La portière ira m'en chercher
une.
Il voulut réitérer ses remercîments aux deux inconnues; mais, à chaque
phrase, la vieille dame l'interrompait en disant:--Demain, monsieur,
ayez bien soin de mettre des sangsues ou de vous faire saigner, buvez
quelques tasses de vulnéraire, soignez-vous, les chutes sont
dangereuses.
La jeune fille regardait à la dérobée le peintre et les tableaux de
l'atelier. Sa contenance et ses regards révélaient une décence
parfaite; sa curiosité ressemblait à de la distraction, et ses yeux
paraissaient exprimer cet intérêt que les femmes portent, avec une
spontanéité pleine de grâce, à tout ce qui est malheur en nous. Les deux
inconnues semblaient oublier les oeuvres du peintre en présence du
peintre souffrant. Lorsqu'il les eut rassurées sur sa situation, elles
sortirent en l'examinant avec une sollicitude également dénuée d'emphase
et de familiarité, sans lui faire de questions indiscrètes, ni sans
chercher à lui inspirer le désir de les connaître. Leurs actions furent
marquées au coin d'un naturel exquis et du bon goût. Leurs manières
nobles et simples produisirent d'abord peu d'effet sur le peintre; mais
plus tard, lorsqu'il se souvint de toutes les circonstances de cet
événement, il en fut vivement frappé. En arrivant à l'étage au-dessus
duquel était situé l'atelier du peintre, la vieille femme s'écria
doucement:--Adélaïde, tu as laissé la porte ouverte.
--C'était pour me secourir, répondit le peintre avec un sourire de
reconnaissance.
--Ma mère, vous êtes descendue tout à l'heure, répliqua la jeune fille
en rougissant.
--Voulez-vous que nous vous accompagnions jusqu'en bas! dit la mère au
peintre. L'escalier est sombre.
--Je vous remercie, madame, je suis bien mieux.
--Tenez bien la rampe!
Les deux femmes restèrent sur le palier pour éclairer le jeune homme en
écoutant le bruit de ses pas.
Afin de faire comprendre tout ce que cette scène pouvait avoir de
piquant et d'inattendu pour le peintre, il faut ajouter que depuis
quelques jours seulement il avait installé son atelier dans les combles
de cette maison, sise à l'endroit le plus obscur, partant le plus boueux
de la rue de Suresne, presque devant l'église de la Madeleine, à deux
pas de son appartement qui se trouvait rue des Champs-Élysées. La
célébrité que son talent lui avait acquise ayant fait de lui l'un des
artistes les plus chers à la France, il commençait à ne plus connaître
le besoin, et jouissait, selon son expression, de ses dernières misères.
Au lieu d'aller travailler dans un de ces ateliers situés près des
barrières et dont le loyer modique était jadis en rapport avec la
modestie de ses gains, il avait satisfait à un désir qui renaissait tous
les jours, en s'évitant une longue course et la perte d'un temps devenu
pour lui plus précieux que jamais. Personne au monde n'eût inspiré
autant d'intérêt qu'Hippolyte Schinner s'il eût consenti à se faire
connaître; mais il ne confiait pas légèrement les secrets de sa vie. Il
était l'idole d'une mère pauvre qui l'avait élevé au prix des plus dures
privations. Mademoiselle Schinner, fille d'un fermier alsacien, n'avait
jamais été mariée. Son âme tendre fut jadis cruellement froissée par un
homme riche qui ne se piquait pas d'une grande délicatesse en amour. Le
jour où, jeune fille et dans tout l'éclat de sa beauté, dans toute la
gloire de sa vie, elle subit, aux dépens de son coeur et de ses belles
illusions, ce désenchantement qui nous atteint si lentement et si vite,
car nous voulons croire le plus tard possible au mal et il nous semble
toujours venu trop promptement, ce jour fut tout un siècle de
réflexions, et ce fut aussi le jour des pensées religieuses et de la
résignation. Elle refusa les aumônes de celui qui l'avait trompée,
renonça au monde, et se fit une gloire de sa faute. Elle se donna toute
à l'amour maternel en lui demandant, pour les jouissances sociales
auxquelles elle disait adieu, toutes ses délices. Elle vécut de son
travail, en accumulant un trésor dans son fils. Aussi plus tard, un
jour, une heure lui paya-t-elle les longs et lents sacrifices de son
indigence. A la dernière exposition, son fils avait reçu la croix de la
Légion d'honneur. Les journaux, unanimes en faveur d'un talent ignoré,
retentissaient encore de louanges sincères. Les artistes eux-mêmes
reconnaissaient Schinner pour un maître, et les marchands couvraient
d'or ses tableaux. A vingt-cinq ans, Hippolyte Schinner, auquel sa mère
avait transmis son âme de femme, avait, mieux que jamais, compris sa
situation dans le monde. Voulant rendre à sa mère les jouissances dont
la société l'avait privée pendant si longtemps, il vivait pour elle,
espérant à force de gloire et de fortune la voir un jour heureuse,
riche, considérée, entourée d'hommes célèbres. Schinner avait donc
choisi ses amis parmi les hommes les plus honorables et les plus
distingués. Difficile dans le choix de ses relations, il voulait encore
élever sa position que son talent faisait déjà si haute. En le forçant à
demeurer dans la solitude, cette mère des grandes pensées, le travail
auquel il s'était voué dès sa jeunesse l'avait laissé dans les belles
croyances qui décorent les premiers jours de la vie. Son âme adolescente
ne méconnaissait aucune des mille pudeurs qui font du jeune homme un
être à part dont le coeur abonde en félicités, en poésies, en
espérances vierges, faibles aux yeux des gens blasés, mais profondes
parce qu'elles sont simples. Il avait été doué de ces manières douces et
polies qui vont si bien à l'âme et séduisent ceux mêmes par qui elles ne
sont pas comprises. Il était bien fait. Sa voix, qui partait du coeur, y
remuait chez les autres des sentiments nobles, et témoignait d'une
modestie vraie par une certaine candeur dans l'accent. En le voyant, on
se sentait porté vers lui par une de ces attractions morales que les
savants ne savent heureusement pas encore analyser, ils y trouveraient
quelque phénomène de galvanisme ou le jeu de je ne sais quel fluide, et
formuleraient nos sentiments par des proportions d'oxygène et
d'électricité. Ces détails feront peut-être comprendre aux gens hardis
par caractère et aux hommes bien cravatés pourquoi, pendant l'absence du
portier, qu'il avait envoyé chercher une voiture au bout de la rue de la
Madeleine, Hippolyte Schinner ne fit à la portière aucune question sur
les deux personnes dont le bon coeur s'était dévoilé pour lui. Mais
quoiqu'il répondît par oui et non aux demandes, naturelles en semblable
occurrence, qui lui furent faites par cette femme sur son accident et
sur l'intervention officieuse des locataires qui occupaient le quatrième
étage, il ne put l'empêcher d'obéir à l'instinct des portiers: elle lui
parla des deux inconnues selon les intérêts de sa politique et d'après
les jugements souterrains de la loge.
--Ah! dit-elle, c'est sans doute mademoiselle Leseigneur et sa mère!
Elles demeurent ici depuis quatre ans, et nous ne savons pas encore ce
qu'elles font. Le matin, jusqu'à midi seulement, une vieille femme de
ménage à moitié sourde, et qui ne parle pas plus qu'un mur, vient les
servir. Le soir, deux ou trois vieux messieurs, décorés comme vous,
monsieur, dont l'un a équipage, des domestiques, et auquel on donne aux
environs de cinquante mille livres de rente, arrivent chez elles, et
restent souvent très-tard. C'est d'ailleurs des locataires bien
tranquilles, comme vous, monsieur. Et puis, c'est économe, ça vit de
rien. Aussitôt qu'il arrive une lettre, elles la paient. C'est drôle,
monsieur, la mère se nomme autrement que sa fille. Ah! quand elles vont
aux Tuileries, mademoiselle est bien flambante, et ne sort pas de fois
qu'elle ne soit suivie de jeunes gens auxquels elle ferme la porte au
nez, et elle fait bien. Le propriétaire ne souffrirait pas...
La voiture était arrivée, Hippolyte n'en entendit pas davantage et
revint chez lui. Sa mère, à laquelle il raconta son aventure, pansa de
nouveau sa blessure, et ne lui permit pas de retourner le lendemain à
son atelier. Consultation faite, diverses prescriptions furent
ordonnées, et Hippolyte resta trois jours au logis. Pendant cette
réclusion, son imagination inoccupée lui rappela vivement, et comme par
fragments, les détails de la scène qu'il avait eue sous les yeux après
son évanouissement. Le profil de la jeune fille tranchait fortement sur
les ténèbres de sa vision intérieure: il revoyait le visage flétri de la
mère ou sentait encore les mains d'Adélaïde, il retrouvait un geste qui
l'avait peu frappé d'abord mais dont les grâces exquises étaient mises
en relief par le souvenir; puis une attitude ou les sons d'une voix
mélodieuse embellis par le lointain de la mémoire reparaissaient tout à
coup, comme ces objets qui plongés au fond des eaux reviennent à la
surface. Aussi, le jour où il lui fut permis de reprendre ses travaux,
retourna-t-il de bonne heure à son atelier; mais la visite qu'il avait
incontestablement le droit de faire à ses voisines était la véritable
cause de son empressement, il oubliait déjà ses tableaux commencés. Au
moment où une passion brise ses langes, il se rencontre des plaisirs
inexplicables que comprennent ceux qui ont aimé. Ainsi quelques
personnes sauront pourquoi le peintre monta lentement les marches du
quatrième étage, et seront dans le secret des pulsations qui se
succédèrent rapidement dans son coeur au moment où il vit la porte brune
du modeste appartement qu'habitait mademoiselle Leseigneur. Cette fille,
qui ne portait pas le nom de sa mère, avait éveillé mille sympathies
chez le jeune peintre; il voulait voir entre eux quelques similitudes de
position, et la dotait des malheurs de sa propre origine. Tout en
travaillant, Hippolyte se livra fort complaisamment à des pensées
d'amour, et, dans un but qui ne s'expliquait pas trop, il fit beaucoup
de bruit pour obliger les deux dames à s'occuper de lui comme il
s'occupait d'elles. Il resta très-tard à son atelier, il y dîna; puis,
vers sept heures, descendit chez ses voisines.
Aucun peintre de moeurs n'a osé nous initier, par pudeur peut-être, aux
intérieurs vraiment curieux de certaines existences parisiennes, au
secret de ces habitations d'où sortent de si fraîches, de si élégantes
toilettes, des femmes si brillantes qui, riches au dehors, laissent voir
partout chez elles les signes d'une fortune équivoque. Si la peinture
est ici trop franchement dessinée, si vous y trouvez des longueurs, n'en
accusez pas la description qui fait, pour ainsi dire, corps avec
l'histoire; car l'aspect de l'appartement habité par ses deux voisines
influa beaucoup sur les sentiments et sur les espérances d'Hippolyte
Schinner.
La maison appartenait à l'un de ces propriétaires chez lesquels
préexiste une horreur profonde pour les réparations et pour les
embellissements, un de ces hommes qui considèrent leur position de
propriétaire parisien comme un état. Dans la grande chaîne des espèces
morales, ces gens tiennent le milieu entre l'avare et l'usurier.
Optimistes par calcul, ils sont tous fidèles au _statu quo_ de
l'Autriche. Si vous parlez de déranger un placard ou une porte, de
pratiquer la plus nécessaire des ventouses, leurs yeux brillent, leur
bile s'émeut, ils se cabrent comme des chevaux effrayés. Quand le vent a
renversé quelques faîteaux de leurs cheminées, ils sont malades et se
privent d'aller au Gymnase ou à la Porte-Saint-Martin pour cause de
réparations. Hippolyte, qui, à propos de certains embellissements à
faire dans son atelier, avait eu _gratis_ la représentation d'une scène
comique avec le sieur Molineux, ne s'étonna pas des tons noirs et gras,
des teintes huileuses, des taches et autres accessoires assez
désagréables qui décoraient les boiseries. Ces stigmates de misère ne
sont point d'ailleurs sans poésie aux yeux d'un artiste.
Mademoiselle Leseigneur vint elle-même ouvrir la porte. En voyant le
jeune peintre, elle le salua; puis, en même temps, avec cette dextérité
parisienne et cette présence d'esprit que la fierté donne, elle se
retourna pour fermer la porte d'une cloison vitrée à travers laquelle
Hippolyte aurait pu voir quelques linges étendus sur des cordes
au-dessus des fourneaux économiques, un vieux lit de sangles, la braise,
le charbon, les fers à repasser, la fontaine filtrante, la vaisselle et
tous les ustensiles particuliers aux petits ménages. Des rideaux de
mousseline assez propres cachaient soigneusement ce _capharnaüm_, mot en
usage pour désigner familièrement ces espèces de laboratoires, mal
éclairé d'ailleurs par des jours de souffrance pris sur une cour
voisine. Avec le rapide coup d'oeil des artistes, Hippolyte vit la
destination, les meubles, l'ensemble et l'état de cette première pièce
coupée en deux. La partie honorable, qui servait à la fois d'antichambre
et de salle à manger, était tendue d'un vieux papier de couleur aurore,
à bordure veloutée, sans doute fabriqué par Réveillon, et dont les trous
ou les taches avaient été soigneusement dissimulés sous des pains à
cacheter. Des estampes représentant les batailles d'Alexandre par
Lebrun, mais à cadres dédorés, garnissaient symétriquement les murs. Au
milieu de cette pièce était une table d'acajou massif, vieille de formes
et à bords usés. Un petit poêle, dont le tuyau droit et sans coude
s'apercevait à peine, se trouvait devant la cheminée, dont l'âtre
contenait une armoire. Par un contraste bizarre, les chaises offraient
quelques vestiges d'une splendeur passée, elles étaient en acajou
sculpté; mais le maroquin rouge du siége, les clous dorés et les
cannetilles montraient des cicatrices aussi nombreuses que celles des
vieux sergents de la garde impériale. Cette pièce servait de musée à
certaines choses qui ne se rencontrent que dans ces sortes de ménages
amphibies, objets innommés participant à la fois du luxe et de la
misère. Entre autres curiosités, Hippolyte vit une longue-vue
magnifiquement ornée, suspendue au-dessus de la petite glace verdâtre
qui décorait la cheminée. Pour appareiller cet étrange mobilier, il y
avait entre la cheminée et la cloison un mauvais buffet peint en acajou,
celui de tous les bois qu'on réussit le moins à simuler. Mais le carreau
rouge et glissant, mais les méchants petits tapis placés devant les
chaises, mais les meubles, tout reluisait de cette propreté frotteuse
qui prête un faux lustre aux vieilleries en accusant encore mieux leurs
défectuosités, leur âge et leurs longs services. Il régnait dans cette
pièce une senteur indéfinissable résultant des exhalaisons du capharnaüm
mêlées aux vapeurs de la salle à manger et à celles de l'escalier,
quoique la fenêtre fût entr'ouverte et que l'air de la rue agitât les
rideaux de percale soigneusement étendus, de manière à cacher
l'embrasure où les précédents locataires avaient signé leur présence par
diverses incrustations, espèces de fresques domestiques. Adélaïde ouvrit
promptement la porte de l'autre chambre, où elle introduisit le peintre
avec un certain plaisir. Hippolyte, qui jadis avait vu chez sa mère les
mêmes signes d'indigence, les remarqua avec la singulière vivacité
d'impression qui caractérise les premières acquisitions de notre
mémoire, et entra mieux que tout autre ne l'aurait fait dans les détails
de cette existence. En reconnaissant les choses de sa vie d'enfance, ce
bon jeune homme n'eut ni mépris de ce malheur caché, ni orgueil du luxe
qu'il venait de conquérir pour sa mère.
--Eh bien, monsieur! j'espère que vous ne vous sentez plus de votre
chute? lui dit la vieille mère en se levant d'une antique bergère
placée au coin de la cheminée et en lui présentant un fauteuil.
--Non, madame. Je viens vous remercier des bons soins que vous m'avez
donnés, et surtout mademoiselle qui m'a entendu tomber.
En disant cette phrase, empreinte de l'adorable stupidité que donnent à
l'âme les premiers troubles de l'amour vrai, Hippolyte regardait la
jeune fille. Adélaïde allumait la lampe à double courant d'air, afin de
faire disparaître une chandelle contenue dans un grand martinet de
cuivre et ornée de quelques cannelures saillantes par un coulage
extraordinaire. Elle salua légèrement, alla mettre le martinet dans
l'antichambre, revint placer la lampe sur la cheminée et s'assit près de
sa mère, un peu en arrière du peintre, afin de pouvoir le regarder à son
aise en paraissant très-occupée du début de la lampe dont la lumière,
saisie par l'humidité d'un verre terni, pétillait en se débattant avec
une mèche noire et mal coupée. En voyant la grande glace qui ornait la
cheminée, Hippolyte y jeta promptement les yeux pour admirer Adélaïde.
La petite ruse de la jeune fille ne servit donc qu'à les embarrasser
tous deux. En causant avec madame Leseigneur, car Hippolyte lui donna ce
nom à tout hasard, il examina le salon, mais décemment et à la dérobée.
Le foyer était si plein de cendres que l'on voyait à peine les figures
égyptiennes des chenets en fer. Deux tisons essayaient de se rejoindre
devant une bûche de terre, enterrée aussi soigneusement que peut l'être
le trésor d'un avare. Un vieux tapis d'Aubusson, bien raccommodé, bien
passé, usé comme l'habit d'un invalide, ne couvrait pas tout le carreau
dont la froideur était à peine amortie. Les murs avaient pour ornement
un papier rougeâtre, figurant une étoffe en lampasse à dessins jaunes.
Au milieu de la paroi opposée à celle où se trouvaient les fenêtres, le
peintre vit une fente et les plis faits dans le papier par les deux
portes d'une alcôve où madame Leseigneur couchait sans doute. Un canapé
placé devant cette ouverture secrète la déguisait imparfaitement. En
face de la cheminée, il y avait une très-belle commode en acajou dont
les ornements ne manquaient ni de richesse ni de goût. Un portrait
accroché au-dessus représentait un militaire de haut grade; mais le peu
de lumière ne permit pas au peintre de distinguer à quelle arme il
appartenait. Cette effroyable croûte paraissait d'ailleurs avoir été
plutôt faite en Chine qu'à Paris. Aux fenêtres, des rideaux en soie
rouge étaient décolorés comme le meuble en tapisserie jaune et rouge qui
garnissait ce salon à deux fins. Sur le marbre de la commode, un
précieux plateau de malachite supportait une douzaine de tasses à café,
magnifiques de peinture, et sans doute faites à Sèvres. Sur la cheminée
s'élevait l'éternelle pendule de l'empire, un guerrier guidant les
quatre chevaux d'un char dont la roue porte à chaque raie le chiffre
d'une heure. Les bougies des flambeaux étaient jaunies par la fumée, et
à chaque coin du chambranle on voyait un vase en porcelaine dans lequel
se trouvait un bouquet de fleurs artificielles plein de poussière et
garni de mousse. Au milieu de la pièce, Hippolyte remarqua une table de
jeu dressée et des cartes neuves. Pour un observateur, il y avait je ne
sais quoi de désolant dans le spectacle de cette misère fardée comme une
vieille femme qui veut faire mentir son visage. A ce spectacle, tout
homme de bon sens se serait proposé secrètement et tout d'abord cette
espèce de dilemme: ou ces deux femmes sont la probité même, ou elles
vivent d'intrigues et de jeu. Mais en voyant Adélaïde, un jeune homme
aussi pur que l'était Schinner devait croire à l'innocence la plus
parfaite, et prêter aux incohérences de ce mobilier les plus honorables
causes.
--Ma fille, dit la vieille dame à la jeune personne, j'ai froid,
faites-nous un peu de feu, et donnez-moi mon châle.
Adélaïde alla dans une chambre contiguë au salon où sans doute elle
couchait, et revint en apportant à sa mère un châle de cachemire qui
neuf dut avoir un grand prix, les dessins étaient indiens; mais vieux,
sans fraîcheur et plein de reprises, il s'harmoniait avec les meubles.
Madame Leseigneur s'en enveloppa très-artistement et avec l'adresse
d'une vieille femme qui voulait faire croire à la vérité de ses paroles.
La jeune fille courut lestement au capharnaüm; et reparut avec une
poignée de menu bois qu'elle jeta bravement dans le feu pour le
rallumer.
Il serait assez difficile de traduire la conversation qui eut lieu entre
ces trois personnes. Guidé par le tact que donnent presque toujours les
malheurs éprouvés dès l'enfance, Hippolyte n'osait se permettre la
moindre observation relative à la position de ses voisines, en voyant
autour de lui les symptômes d'une gêne si mal déguisée. La plus simple
question eût été indiscrète et ne devait être faite que par une amitié
déjà vieille. Néanmoins le peintre était profondément préoccupé de
cette misère cachée, son âme généreuse en souffrait; mais sachant ce que
toute espèce de pitié, même la plus amie, peut avoir d'offensif, il se
trouvait mal à l'aise du désaccord qui existait entre ses pensées et ses
paroles. Les deux dames parlèrent d'abord de peinture, car les femmes
devinent très-bien les secrets embarras que cause une première visite;
elles les éprouvent peut-être, et la nature de leur esprit leur fournit
mille ressources pour les faire cesser. En interrogeant le jeune homme
sur les procédés matériels de son art, sur ses études, Adélaïde et sa
mère surent l'enhardir à causer. Les riens indéfinissables de leur
conversation animée de bienveillance amenèrent tout naturellement
Hippolyte à lancer des remarques ou des réflexions qui peignirent la
nature de ses moeurs et de son âme. Les chagrins avaient prématurément
flétri le visage de la vieille dame, sans doute belle autrefois; mais il
ne lui restait plus que les traits saillants, les contours, en un mot le
squelette d'une physionomie dont l'ensemble indiquait une grande
finesse, beaucoup de grâce dans le jeu des yeux où se retrouvait
l'expression particulière aux femmes de l'ancienne cour et que rien ne
saurait définir. Ces traits si fins, si déliés pouvaient tout aussi bien
dénoter des sentiments mauvais, faire supposer l'astuce et la ruse
féminines à un haut degré de perversité que révéler les délicatesses
d'une belle âme. En effet, le visage de la femme a cela d'embarrassant
pour les observateurs vulgaires, que la différence entre la franchise et
la duplicité, entre le génie de l'intrigue et le génie du coeur, y est
imperceptible. L'homme doué d'une vue pénétrante devine ces nuances
insaisissables que produisent une ligne plus ou moins courbe, une
fossette plus ou moins creuse, une saillie plus ou moins bombée ou
proéminente. L'appréciation de ces diagnostics est tout entière dans le
domaine de l'intuition, qui peut seule faire découvrir ce que chacun est
intéressé à cacher. Il en était du visage de cette vieille dame comme de
l'appartement qu'elle habitait: il semblait aussi difficile de savoir si
cette misère couvrait des vices ou une haute probité, que de reconnaître
si la mère d'Adélaïde était une ancienne coquette habituée à tout peser,
à tout calculer, à tout vendre, ou une femme aimante, pleine de noblesse
et d'aimables qualités. Mais à l'âge de Schinner, le premier mouvement
du coeur est de croire au bien. Aussi en contemplant le front noble et
presque dédaigneux d'Adélaïde, en regardant ses yeux pleins d'âme et de
pensées, respira-t-il, pour ainsi dire, les suaves et modestes parfums
de la vertu. Au milieu de la conversation, il saisit l'occasion de
parler des portraits en général, pour avoir le droit d'examiner
l'effroyable pastel dont toutes les teintes avaient pâli, et dont la
poussière était en grande partie tombée.
--Vous tenez sans doute à cette peinture en faveur de la ressemblance,
mesdames, car le dessin en est horrible? dit-il en regardant Adélaïde.
--Elle a été faite à Calcutta, en grande hâte, répondit la mère d'une
voix émue.
Elle contempla l'esquisse informe avec cet abandon profond que donnent
les souvenirs de bonheur quand ils se réveillent et tombent sur le
coeur, comme une bienfaisante rosée aux fraîches impressions de laquelle
on aime à s'abandonner; mais il y eut aussi dans l'expression du visage
de la vieille dame les vestiges d'un deuil éternel. Le peintre voulut du
moins interpréter ainsi l'attitude et la physionomie de sa voisine, près
de laquelle il vint alors s'asseoir.
--Madame, dit-il, encore un peu de temps, et les couleurs de ce pastel
auront disparu. Le portrait n'existera plus que dans votre mémoire. Là
où vous verrez une figure qui vous est chère, les autres ne pourront
plus rien apercevoir. Voulez-vous me permettre de transporter cette
ressemblance sur la toile? elle y sera plus solidement fixée qu'elle ne
l'est sur ce papier. Accordez-moi, en faveur de notre voisinage, le
plaisir de vous rendre ce service. Il se rencontre des heures pendant
lesquelles un artiste aime à se délasser de ses grandes compositions par
des travaux d'une portée moins élevée, ce sera donc pour moi une
distraction que de refaire cette tête.
La vieille dame tressaillit en entendant ces paroles, et Adélaïde jeta
sur le peintre un de ces regards recueillis qui semblent être un jet de
l'âme. Hippolyte voulait appartenir à ses deux voisines par quelque
lien, et conquérir le droit de se mêler à leur vie. Son offre, en
s'adressant aux plus vives affections du coeur, était la seule qu'il lui
fût possible de faire: elle contentait sa fierté d'artiste, et n'avait
rien de blessant pour les deux dames. Madame Leseigneur accepta sans
empressement ni regret, mais avec cette conscience des grandes âmes qui
savent l'étendue des liens que nouent de semblables obligations et qui
en font un magnifique éloge, une preuve d'estime.
--Il me semble, dit le peintre, que cet uniforme est celui d'un officier
de marine?
--Oui, dit-elle, c'est celui des capitaines de vaisseau. Monsieur de
Rouville, mon mari, est mort à Batavia des suites d'une blessure reçue
dans un combat contre un vaisseau anglais qui le rencontra sur les côtes
d'Asie. Il montait une frégate de cinquante-six canons, et le _Revenge_
était un vaisseau de quatre-vingt-seize. La lutte fut très-inégale; mais
il se défendit si courageusement qu'il la maintint jusqu'à la nuit et
put échapper. Quand je revins en France, Bonaparte n'avait pas encore le
pouvoir, et l'on me refusa une pension. Lorsque, dernièrement, je la
sollicitai de nouveau, le ministre me dit avec dureté que si le baron de
Rouville eût émigré, je l'aurais conservé; qu'il serait sans doute
aujourd'hui contre-amiral; enfin, son excellence finit par m'opposer je
ne sais quelle loi sur les déchéances. Je n'ai fait cette démarche à
laquelle des amis m'avaient poussée, que pour ma pauvre Adélaïde. J'ai
toujours eu de la répugnance à tendre la main au nom d'une douleur qui
ôte à une femme sa voix et ses forces. Je n'aime pas cette évaluation
pécuniaire d'un sang irréparablement versé...
--Ma mère, ce sujet de conversation vous fait toujours mal.
Sur ce mot d'Adélaïde, la baronne Leseigneur de Rouville inclina la tête
et garda le silence.
--Monsieur, dit la jeune fille à Hippolyte, je croyais que les travaux
des peintres étaient en général peu bruyants!
A cette question, Schinner se prit à rougir en se souvenant du tapage
qu'il avait fait. Adélaïde n'acheva pas et lui sauva quelque mensonge en
se levant tout à coup au bruit d'une voiture qui s'arrêtait à la porte,
elle alla dans sa chambre d'où elle revint aussitôt en tenant deux
flambeaux dorés garnis de bougies entamées qu'elle alluma promptement;
et sans attendre le tintement de la sonnette, elle ouvrit la porte de la
première pièce où elle laissa la lampe. Le bruit d'un baiser reçu et
donné retentit jusque dans le coeur d'Hippolyte. L'impatience que le
jeune homme eut de voir celui qui traitait si familièrement Adélaïde ne
fut pas promptement satisfaite. Les arrivants eurent avec la jeune fille
une conversation à voix basse qu'il trouva bien longue. Enfin,
mademoiselle de Rouville reparut suivie de deux hommes dont le costume,
la physionomie et l'aspect étaient toute une histoire. Agé d'environ
soixante ans, le premier portait un de ces habits inventés, je crois,
pour Louis XVIII alors régnant, et dans lesquels le problème vestimental
le plus difficile avait été résolu par un tailleur qui devrait être
immortel. Cet artiste connaissait, à coup sûr, l'art des transitions qui
fut tout le génie de ce temps si politiquement mobile. N'est-ce pas un
bien rare mérite que de savoir juger son époque? Cet habit, que les
jeunes gens d'aujourd'hui peuvent prendre pour une fable, n'était ni
civil ni militaire et pouvait passer tour à tour pour militaire et pour
civil. Des fleurs de lis brodées ornaient les retroussis des deux pans
de derrière. Les boutons dorés étaient également fleurdelisés. Sur les
épaules, deux attentes vides demandaient des épaulettes inutiles. Ces
deux symptômes de milice étaient là comme une pétition sans apostille.
Chez le vieillard, la boutonnière de cet habit en drap bleu de roi était
fleurie de plusieurs rubans. Il tenait sans doute toujours à la main son
tricorne garni d'une ganse d'or, car les ailes neigeuses de ses cheveux
poudrés n'offraient pas trace de la pression du chapeau. Il semblait ne
pas avoir plus de cinquante ans, et paraissait jouir d'une santé
robuste. Tout en accusant le caractère loyal et franc des vieux émigrés,
sa physionomie dénotait aussi les moeurs libertines et faciles, les
passions gaies et l'insouciance de ces mousquetaires, jadis si célèbres
dans les fastes de la galanterie. Ses gestes, son allure, ses manières
annonçaient qu'il ne voulait se corriger ni de son royalisme, ni de sa
religion, ni de ses amours.
Une figure vraiment fantastique suivait ce prétentieux _voltigeur de
Louis XIV_ (tel fut le sobriquet donné par les bonapartistes à ces
nobles restes de la monarchie); mais pour la bien peindre il faudrait en
faire l'objet principal du tableau où elle n'est qu'un accessoire.
Figurez-vous un personnage sec et maigre, vêtu comme l'était le premier,
mais n'en étant pour ainsi dire que le reflet, ou l'ombre, si vous
voulez? L'habit, neuf chez l'un, se trouvait vieux et flétri chez
l'autre. La poudre des cheveux semblait moins blanche chez le second,
l'or des fleurs de lis moins éclatant, les attentes de l'épaulette plus
désespérées et plus recroquevillées, l'intelligence plus faible, la vie
plus avancée vers le terme fatal que chez le premier. Enfin, il
réalisait ce mot de Rivarol sur Champcenetz: «C'est mon clair de lune.»
Il n'était que le double de l'autre, le double pâle et pauvre, car il se
trouvait entre eux toute la différence qui existe entre la première et
la dernière épreuve d'une lithographie. Ce vieillard muet fut un mystère
pour le peintre, et resta constamment un mystère. Le chevalier, il
était chevalier, ne parla pas, et personne ne lui parla. Était-ce un
ami, un parent pauvre, un homme qui restait près du vieux galant comme
une demoiselle de compagnie près d'une vieille femme? Tenait-il le
milieu entre le chien, le perroquet et l'ami? Avait-il sauvé la fortune
ou seulement la vie de son bienfaiteur? Était-ce le _Trim_ d'un autre
capitaine Tobie? Ailleurs, comme chez la baronne de Rouville, il
excitait toujours la curiosité sans jamais la satisfaire. Qui pouvait,
sous la Restauration, se rappeler l'attachement qui liait avant la
Révolution ce chevalier à la femme de son ami, morte depuis vingt ans?
Le personnage qui paraissait être le plus neuf de ces deux débris
s'avança galamment vers la baronne de Rouville, lui baisa la main, et
s'assit auprès d'elle. L'autre salua et se mit près de son type, à une
distance représentée par deux chaises. Adélaïde vint appuyer ses coudes
sur le dossier du fauteuil occupé par le vieux gentilhomme en imitant,
sans le savoir, la pose que Guérin a donnée à la soeur de Didon dans son
célèbre tableau. Quoique la familiarité du gentilhomme fût celle d'un
père, pour le moment ses libertés parurent déplaire à la jeune fille.
--Eh bien! tu me boudes? dit-il en jetant sur Schinner de ces regards
obliques pleins de finesse et de ruse, regards diplomatiques dont
l'expression trahissait la prudente inquiétude, la curiosité polie des
gens bien élevés qui semblent demander en voyant un inconnu:--Est-il des
nôtres?
--Vous voyez notre voisin, lui dit la vieille dame en lui montrant
Hippolyte, Monsieur est un peintre célèbre dont le nom doit être connu
de vous malgré votre insouciance pour les arts.
Le gentilhomme reconnut la malice de sa vieille amie dans l'omission
qu'elle faisait du nom, et salua le jeune homme.
--Certes, dit-il, j'ai beaucoup entendu parler de ses tableaux au
dernier Salon. Le talent a de beaux priviléges, monsieur, ajouta-t-il en
regardant le ruban rouge de l'artiste. Cette distinction, qu'il nous
faut acquérir au prix de notre sang et de longs services, vous l'obtenez
jeunes; mais toutes les gloires sont frères, ajouta-t-il en portant les
mains à sa croix de Saint-Louis.
Hippolyte balbutia quelques paroles de remercîment, et rentra dans son
silence, se contentant d'admirer avec un enthousiasme croissant la belle
tête de jeune fille par laquelle il était charmé. Bientôt il s'oublia
dans cette contemplation, sans plus songer à la misère profonde du
logis. Pour lui, le visage d'Adélaïde se détachait sur une atmosphère
lumineuse. Il répondit brièvement aux questions qui lui furent adressées
et qu'il entendit heureusement, grâce à une singulière faculté de notre
âme dont la pensée peut en quelque sorte se dédoubler parfois. A qui
n'est-il pas arrivé de rester plongé dans une méditation voluptueuse ou
triste, d'en écouter la voix en soi-même, et d'assister à une
conversation ou à une lecture? Admirable dualisme qui souvent aide à
prendre les ennuyeux en patience! Féconde et riante, l'espérance lui
versa mille pensées de bonheur, et il ne voulut plus rien observer
autour de lui. Enfant plein de confiance, il lui parut honteux
d'analyser un plaisir. Après un certain laps de temps, il s'aperçut que
la vieille dame et sa fille jouaient avec le vieux gentilhomme. Quant au
satellite de celui-ci, fidèle à son état d'ombre, il se tenait debout
derrière son ami dont le jeu le préoccupait, répondant aux muettes
questions que lui faisait le joueur par de petites grimaces approbatives
qui répétaient les mouvements interrogateurs de l'autre physionomie.
--Du Halga, je perds toujours, disait le gentilhomme.
--Vous écartez mal, répondait la baronne de Rouville.
--Voilà trois mois que je n'ai pas pu vous gagner une seule partie,
reprit-il.
--Monsieur le comte a-t-il les as? demanda la vieille dame.
--Oui. Encore un marqué, dit-il.
--Voulez-vous que je vous conseille? disait Adélaïde.
--Non, non, reste devant moi. Ventre-de-biche! ce serait trop perdre que
de ne pas t'avoir en face.
Enfin la partie finit. Le gentilhomme tira sa bourse, et jetant deux
louis sur le tapis, non sans humeur:--Quarante francs, juste comme de
l'or, dit-il. Et diantre! il est onze heures.
--Il est onze heures, répéta le personnage muet en regardant le peintre.
Le jeune homme, entendant cette parole un peu plus distinctement que
toutes les autres, pensa qu'il était temps de se retirer. Rentrant alors
dans le monde des idées vulgaires, il trouva quelques lieux communs pour
prendre la parole, salua la baronne, sa fille, les deux inconnus, et
sortit en proie aux premières félicités de l'amour vrai, sans chercher à
s'analyser les petits événements de cette soirée.
Le lendemain, le jeune peintre éprouva le désir le plus violent de
revoir Adélaïde. S'il avait écouté sa passion, il serait entré chez ses
voisines dès six heures du matin, en arrivant à son atelier. Il eut
cependant encore assez de raison pour attendre jusqu'à l'après-midi.
Mais, aussitôt qu'il crut pouvoir se présenter chez madame de Rouville,
il descendit, sonna, non sans quelques larges battements de coeur; et,
rougissant comme une jeune fille, il demanda timidement le portrait du
baron de Rouville à mademoiselle Leseigneur qui était venue lui ouvrir.
--Mais entrez, lui dit Adélaïde qui l'avait sans doute entendu descendre
de son atelier.
Le peintre la suivit, honteux, décontenancé, ne sachant rien dire, tant
le bonheur le rendait stupide. Voir Adélaïde, écouter le frissonnement
de sa robe, après avoir désiré pendant toute une matinée d'être près
d'elle, après s'être levé cent fois en disant:--Je descends! et n'être
pas descendu; c'était, pour lui, vivre si richement que de telles
sensations trop prolongées lui auraient usé l'âme. Le coeur a la
singulière puissance de donner un prix extraordinaire à des riens.
Quelle joie n'est-ce pas pour un voyageur de recueillir un brin d'herbe,
une feuille inconnue, s'il a risqué sa vie dans cette recherche! Les
riens de l'amour sont ainsi. La vieille dame n'était pas dans le salon.
Quand la jeune fille s'y trouva seule avec le peintre, elle apporta une
chaise pour avoir le portrait; mais, en s'apercevant qu'elle ne pouvait
pas le décrocher sans mettre le pied sur la commode, elle se tourna vers
Hippolyte et lui dit en rougissant:--Je ne suis pas assez grande.
Voulez-vous le prendre?
Un sentiment de pudeur, dont témoignaient l'expression de sa physionomie
et l'accent de sa voix, était le véritable motif de sa demande; et le
jeune homme, la comprenant ainsi, lui jeta un de ces regards
intelligents qui sont le plus doux langage de l'amour. Adélaïde, voyant
que le peintre l'avait devinée, baissa les yeux par un mouvement de
fierté dont le secret appartient aux vierges. Ne trouvant pas un mot à
dire, et presque intimidé, le peintre prit alors le tableau, l'examina
gravement en le mettant au jour près de la fenêtre, et s'en alla sans
dire autre chose à mademoiselle Leseigneur que: «Je vous le rendrai
bientôt.» Tous deux avaient, pendant ce rapide instant, ressenti une de
ces commotions vives dont les effets dans l'âme peuvent se comparer à
ceux que produit une pierre jetée au fond d'un lac. Les réflexions les
plus douces naissent et se succèdent, indéfinissables, multipliées, sans
but, agitant le coeur comme les rides circulaires qui plissent
longtemps l'onde en partant du point où la pierre est tombée. Hippolyte
revint dans son atelier armé de ce portrait. Déjà son chevalet avait été
garni d'une toile, une palette chargée de couleurs; les pinceaux étaient
nettoyés, la place et le jour choisi. Aussi, jusqu'à l'heure du dîner,
travailla-t-il au portrait avec cette ardeur que les artistes mettent à
leurs caprices. Il revint le soir même chez la baronne de Rouville, et y
resta depuis neuf heures jusqu'à onze. Hormis les différents sujets de
conversation, cette soirée ressembla fort exactement à la précédente.
Les deux vieillards arrivèrent à la même heure, la même partie de piquet
eut lieu, les mêmes phrases furent dites par les joueurs, la somme
perdue par l'ami d'Adélaïde fut aussi considérable que celle perdue la
veille; seulement Hippolyte, un peu plus hardi, osa causer avec la jeune
fille.
Huit jours se passèrent ainsi, pendant lesquels les sentiments du
peintre et ceux d'Adélaïde subirent ces délicieuses et lentes
transformations qui amènent les âmes à une parfaite entente. Aussi, de
jour en jour, le regard par lequel Adélaïde accueillait son ami était-il
devenu plus intime, plus confiant, plus gai, plus franc; sa voix, ses
manières eurent quelque chose de plus onctueux, de plus familier. Tous
deux riaient, causaient, se communiquaient leurs pensées, parlaient
d'eux-mêmes avec la naïveté de deux enfants qui, dans l'espace d'une
journée, ont fait connaissance, comme s'ils s'étaient vus depuis trois
ans. Schinner jouait au piquet. Ignorant et novice, il faisait
naturellement école sur école; et, comme le vieillard, il perdait
presque toutes les parties. Sans s'être encore confié leur amour, les
deux amants savaient qu'ils s'appartenaient l'un à l'autre. Hippolyte
avait exercé son pouvoir avec bonheur sur sa timide amie. Bien des
concessions lui avaient été faites par Adélaïde qui, craintive et
dévouée, était la dupe de ces fausses bouderies que l'amant le moins
habile ou la jeune fille la plus naïve inventent et dont ils se servent
sans cesse, comme les enfants gâtés abusent de la puissance que leur
donne l'amour de leur mère. Toute familiarité avait cessé entre le vieux
comte et Adélaïde. La jeune fille avait naturellement compris les
tristesses du peintre et les pensées cachées dans les plis de son front,
dans l'accent brusque du peu de mots qu'il prononçait lorsque le
vieillard baisait sans façon les mains ou le cou d'Adélaïde. De son
côté, mademoiselle Leseigneur demandait à son amant un compte sévère de
ses moindres actions. Elle était si malheureuse, si inquiète quand
Hippolyte ne venait pas; elle savait si bien le gronder de ses absences
que le peintre cessa de voir ses amis et d'aller dans le monde. Adélaïde
laissa percer la jalousie naturelle aux femmes en apprenant que parfois,
en sortant de chez madame de Rouville, à onze heures, le peintre faisait
encore des visites et parcourait les salons les plus brillants de Paris.
D'abord elle prétendit que ce genre de vie était mauvais pour la santé;
puis elle trouva moyen de lui dire, avec cette conviction profonde à
laquelle l'accent, le geste et le regard d'une personne aimée donnent
tant de pouvoir: «qu'un homme obligé de prodiguer à plusieurs femmes à
la fois son temps et les grâces de son esprit ne pouvait pas être
l'objet d'une affection bien vive.» Le peintre fut donc amené, autant
par le despotisme de la passion que par les exigences d'une jeune fille
aimante, à ne vivre que dans ce petit appartement où tout lui plaisait.
Enfin, jamais amour ne fut ni plus pur ni plus ardent. De part et
d'autre, la même foi, la même délicatesse firent croître cette passion
sans le secours de ces sacrifices par lesquels beaucoup de gens
cherchent à se prouver leur amour. Entre eux il existait un échange
continuel de sensations douces, et ils ne savaient qui donnait et qui
recevait le plus. Un penchant involontaire rendait l'union de leurs âmes
toujours étroite. Le progrès de ce sentiment vrai fut si rapide que,
deux mois après l'accident auquel le peintre avait dû le bonheur de
connaître Adélaïde, leur vie était devenue une même vie. Dès le matin,
la jeune fille, entendant le pas de son amant, pouvait se dire:--Il est
là! Quand Hippolyte retournait chez sa mère à l'heure du dîner, il ne
manquait jamais de venir saluer ses voisines; et le soir il accourait, à
l'heure accoutumée, avec une ponctualité d'amoureux. Ainsi, la femme la
plus tyrannique et la plus ambitieuse en amour n'aurait pu faire le plus
léger reproche au jeune peintre. Aussi Adélaïde savourait-elle un
bonheur sans mélange et sans bornes en voyant se réaliser dans toute son
étendue l'idéal qu'il est si naturel de rêver à son âge. Le vieux
gentilhomme venait moins souvent, le jaloux Hippolyte l'avait remplacé
le soir, au tapis vert, dans son malheur constant au jeu. Cependant, au
milieu de son bonheur, en songeant à la désastreuse situation de madame
de Rouville, car il avait acquis plus d'une preuve de sa détresse, il ne
pouvait chasser une pensée importune. Déjà plusieurs fois il s'était
dit en rentrant chez lui:--Comment! vingt francs tous les soirs? Et il
n'osait s'avouer à lui-même d'odieux soupçons. Il employa deux mois à
faire le portrait, et quand il fut fini, verni, encadré, il le regarda
comme un de ses meilleurs ouvrages. Madame la baronne de Rouville ne lui
en avait plus parlé. Était-ce insouciance ou fierté? Le peintre ne
voulut pas s'expliquer ce silence.
Il complota joyeusement avec Adélaïde de mettre le portrait en place
pendant une absence de madame de Rouville. Un jour donc, durant la
promenade que sa mère faisait ordinairement aux Tuileries, Adélaïde
monta seule, pour la première fois, à l'atelier d'Hippolyte, sous
prétexte de voir le portrait dans le jour favorable sous lequel il avait
été peint. Elle demeura muette et immobile en proie à une contemplation
délicieuse où se fondaient en un seul tous les sentiments de la femme.
Ne se résument-ils pas tous dans une juste admiration pour l'homme aimé?
Lorsque le peintre, inquiet de ce silence, se pencha pour voir la jeune
fille, elle lui tendit la main, sans pouvoir dire un mot; mais deux
larmes étaient tombées de ses yeux. Hippolyte prit cette main, la
couvrit de baisers, et, pendant un moment, ils se regardèrent en
silence, voulant tous deux s'avouer leur amour, et ne l'osant pas. Le
peintre, ayant gardé la main d'Adélaïde dans les siennes, une même
chaleur et un même mouvement leur apprirent que leurs coeurs battaient
aussi fort l'un que l'autre. Trop émue, la jeune fille s'éloigna
doucement d'Hippolyte, et dit, en lui jetant un regard plein de
naïveté:--Vous allez rendre ma mère bien heureuse!
--Quoi! votre mère seulement? demanda-t-il.
--Oh! moi, je le suis trop.
Le peintre baissa la tête et resta silencieux, effrayé de la violence
des sentiments que l'accent de cette phrase réveilla dans son coeur.
Comprenant alors tous deux le danger de cette situation, ils
descendirent et mirent le portrait à sa place. Hippolyte dîna pour la
première fois avec la baronne et sa fille. Il fut fêté, complimenté par
madame de Rouville avec une bonhomie rare. Dans son attendrissement et
tout en pleurs, la vieille dame voulut l'embrasser. Le soir, le vieil
émigré, ancien camarade du baron de Rouville, avec lequel il avait vécu
fraternellement, fit à ses deux amies une visite pour leur apprendre
qu'il venait d'être nommé vice-amiral. Ses navigations terrestres à
travers l'Allemagne et la Russie lui avaient été comptées comme des
campagnes navales. A l'aspect du portrait, il serra cordialement la main
du peintre, et s'écria:--Ma foi! quoique ma vieille carcasse ne vaille
pas la peine d'être conservée, je donnerais bien cinq cents pistoles
pour me voir aussi ressemblant que l'est mon vieux Rouville.
A cette proposition, la baronne regarda son ami, et sourit en laissant
éclater sur son visage les marques d'une soudaine reconnaissance.
Hippolyte crut deviner que le vieil amiral voulait lui offrir le prix
des deux portraits en payant le sien. Sa fierté d'artiste, tout autant
que sa jalousie peut-être, s'offensa de cette pensée, et il
répondit:--Monsieur, si je peignais le portrait, je n'aurais pas fait
celui-ci.
L'amiral se mordit les lèvres et se mit à jouer. Le peintre resta près
d'Adélaïde qui lui proposa de faire une partie, il accepta. Tout en
jouant, il observa chez madame de Rouville une ardeur pour le jeu qui le
surprit. Jamais cette vieille baronne n'avait encore manifesté un désir
si ardent pour le gain, ni un plaisir si vif en palpant les pièces d'or
du gentilhomme. Pendant la soirée, de mauvais soupçons vinrent troubler
le bonheur d'Hippolyte, et lui donnèrent de la défiance. Madame de
Rouville vivrait-elle donc du jeu? Ne jouait-elle pas en ce moment pour
acquitter quelque dette, ou poussée par quelque nécessité? Peut-être
n'avait-elle pas payé son loyer. Ce vieillard paraissait être assez fin
pour ne pas se laisser impunément prendre son argent. Quel pouvait donc
être l'intérêt qui l'attirait dans cette maison pauvre, lui riche?
Pourquoi jadis était-il si familier près d'Adélaïde, et pourquoi soudain
avait-il renoncé à des privautés acquises et dues peut-être? Ces
réflexions lui vinrent involontairement, et l'excitèrent à examiner avec
une nouvelle attention le vieillard et la baronne. Il fut mécontent de
leurs airs d'intelligence et des regards obliques qu'ils jetaient sur
Adélaïde et sur lui. «Me tromperait-on?» fut pour Hippolyte une dernière
idée, horrible, flétrissante, et à laquelle il crut précisément assez
pour en être torturé. Il voulut rester après le départ des deux
vieillards pour confirmer ses soupçons ou pour les dissiper. Il avait
tiré sa bourse afin de payer Adélaïde; mais emporté par ses pensées
poignantes, il mit sa bourse sur la table, tomba dans une rêverie qui
dura peu; puis, honteux de son silence, il se leva, répondit à une
interrogation banale que lui faisait madame de Rouville, et vint près
d'elle pour, tout en causant, mieux scruter ce vieux visage. Il
sortit en proie à mille incertitudes. A peine avait-il descendu quelques
marches, il se souvint d'avoir oublié son argent sur la table, et
rentra.
[Illustration:
ADELAÏDE.
(LA BOURSE.)]
--Je vous ai laissé ma bourse, dit-il à la jeune fille.
--Non, répondit-elle en rougissant.
--Je la croyais là, reprit-il en montrant la table de jeu; mais, tout
honteux pour Adélaïde et pour la baronne de ne pas l'y voir, il les
regarda d'un air hébété qui les fit rire, pâlit et reprit en tâtant son
gilet: «Je me suis trompé, je l'ai sans doute.» Il salua, et sortit.
Dans l'un des côtés de cette bourse, il y avait quinze louis et, de
l'autre, quelque menue monnaie. Le vol était si flagrant, si
effrontément nié, qu'Hippolyte ne pouvait plus conserver de doute sur la
moralité de ses voisines. Il s'arrêta dans l'escalier, le descendit avec
peine: ses jambes tremblaient, il avait des vertiges, il suait, il
grelottait, et se trouvait hors d'état de marcher, aux prises avec
l'atroce commotion causée par le renversement de toutes ses espérances.
Dès ce moment, il retrouve dans sa mémoire une foule d'observations
légères en apparence, mais qui corroboraient les affreux soupçons
auxquels il avait été en proie, et qui, en lui prouvant la réalité du
dernier fait, lui ouvraient les yeux sur le caractère et la vie de ces
deux femmes. Avaient-elles donc attendu que le portrait fût donné, pour
voler cette bourse? Combiné, le vol était encore plus odieux. Le peintre
se souvint, pour son malheur, que, depuis deux ou trois soirées,
Adélaïde, en paraissant examiner avec une curiosité de jeune fille le
travail particulier du réseau de soie usé, vérifiait probablement
l'argent contenu dans la bourse en faisant des plaisanteries innocentes
en apparence, mais qui sans doute avaient pour but d'épier le moment où
la somme serait assez forte pour être dérobée.--Le vieil amiral a
peut-être d'excellentes raisons pour ne pas épouser Adélaïde, et alors
la baronne aura tâché de me... A cette supposition, il s'arrêta,
n'achevant pas même sa pensée qui fut détruite par une réflexion bien
juste:--Si la baronne, pensa-t-il, espère me marier avec sa fille, elles
ne m'auraient pas volé. Puis il essaya, pour ne point renoncer à ses
illusions, à son amour déjà si fortement enraciné, de chercher quelque
justification dans le hasard.--Ma bourse sera tombée à terre, se dit-il,
elle sera restée sur mon fauteuil. Je l'ai peut-être, je suis si
distrait! Il se fouilla par des mouvements rapides et ne retrouva pas la
maudite bourse. Sa mémoire cruelle lui retraçait par instants la fatale
vérité. Il voyait distinctement sa bourse étalée sur le tapis; mais ne
doutant plus du vol, il excusait alors Adélaïde en se disant que l'on ne
devait pas juger si promptement les malheureux. Il y avait sans doute un
secret dans cette action en apparence si dégradante. Il ne voulait pas
que cette fière et noble figure fût un mensonge. Cependant cet
appartement si misérable lui apparut dénué des poésies de l'amour qui
embellit tout: il le vit sale et flétri, le considéra comme la
représentation d'une vie intérieure sans noblesse, inoccupée, vicieuse.
Nos sentiments ne sont-ils pas, pour ainsi dire, écrits sur les choses
qui nous entourent? Le lendemain matin, il se leva sans avoir dormi. La
douleur du coeur, cette grave maladie morale, avait fait en lui
d'énormes progrès. Perdre un bonheur rêvé, renoncer à tout un avenir,
est une souffrance plus aiguë que celle causée par la ruine d'une
félicité ressentie, quelque complète qu'elle ait été: l'espérance
n'est-elle pas meilleure que le souvenir? Les méditations dans
lesquelles tombe tout à coup notre âme sont alors comme une mer sans
rivage au sein de laquelle nous pouvons nager pendant un moment, mais où
il faut que notre amour se noie et périsse. Et c'est une affreuse mort.
Les sentiments ne sont-ils pas la partie la plus brillante de votre vie?
De cette mort partielle viennent, chez certaines organisations délicates
ou fortes, les grands ravages produits par les désenchantements, par les
espérances et les passions trompées. Il en fut ainsi du jeune peintre.
Il sortit de grand matin, alla se promener sous les frais ombrages des
Tuileries, absorbé par ses idées, oubliant tout dans le monde. Là, par
un hasard qui n'avait rien d'extraordinaire, il rencontra un de ses amis
les plus intimes, un camarade de collége et d'atelier, avec lequel il
avait vécu mieux qu'on ne vit avec un frère.
--Eh bien, Hippolyte, qu'as-tu donc? lui dit François Souchet, jeune
sculpteur qui venait de remporter le grand prix et devait bientôt partir
pour l'Italie.
--Je suis très-malheureux, répondit gravement Hippolyte.
--Il n'y a qu'une affaire de coeur qui puisse te chagriner. Argent,
gloire, considération, rien ne te manque.
Insensiblement, les confidences commencèrent, et le peintre avoua son
amour. Au moment où il parla de la rue de Suresne et d'une jeune
personne logée à un quatrième étage:--Halte-là! s'écria gaiement
Souchet. C'est une petite fille que je viens voir tous les matins à
l'Assomption, et à laquelle je fais la cour. Mais, mon cher, nous la
connaissons tous. Sa mère est une baronne! Est-ce que tu crois aux
baronnes logées au quatrième? Brrr. Ah! bien, tu es un homme de l'âge
d'or. Nous voyons ici, dans cette allée, la vieille mère tous les jours;
mais elle a une figure, une tournure qui disent tout. Comment! tu n'as
pas deviné ce qu'elle est à la manière dont elle tient son sac?
Les deux amis se promenèrent long-temps, et plusieurs jeunes gens qui
connaissaient Souchet ou Schinner se joignirent à eux. L'aventure du
peintre, jugée comme de peu d'importance, leur fut racontée par le
sculpteur.
--Et lui aussi, disait-il, a vu cette petite!
Ce fut des observations, des rires, des moqueries, faites innocemment et
avec toute la gaieté des artistes; mais desquelles Hippolyte souffrit
horriblement. Une certaine pudeur d'âme le mettait mal à l'aise en
voyant le secret de son coeur traité si légèrement, sa passion déchirée,
mise en lambeaux, une jeune fille inconnue et dont la vie paraissait si
modeste, sujette à des jugements vrais ou faux, portés avec tant
d'insouciance. Il affecta d'être mû par un esprit de contradiction, il
demanda sérieusement à chacun les preuves de ses assertions, et les
plaisanteries recommencèrent.
--Mais, mon cher ami, as-tu vu le châle de la baronne? disait Souchet.
--As-tu suivi la petite quand elle trotte le matin à l'Assomption?
disait Joseph Bridau, jeune rapin de l'atelier de Gros.
--Ah! la mère a, entre autres vertus, une certaine robe grise que je
regarde comme un type, dit Bixiou, le faiseur de caricatures.
--Écoute, Hippolyte, reprit le sculpteur, viens ici vers quatre heures,
et analyse un peu la marche de la mère et de la fille. Si, après, tu as
des doutes! hé bien, l'on ne fera jamais rien de toi: tu seras capable
d'épouser la fille de ta portière.
En proie aux sentiments les plus contraires, le peintre quitta ses amis.
Adélaïde et sa mère lui semblaient devoir être au-dessus de ces
accusations, et il éprouvait, au fond de son coeur, le remords d'avoir
soupçonné la pureté de cette jeune fille, si belle et si simple. Il vint
à son atelier, passa devant la porte de l'appartement où était Adélaïde,
et sentit en lui-même une douleur de coeur à laquelle nul homme ne se
trompe. Il aimait mademoiselle de Rouville si passionnément que, malgré
le vol de la bourse, il l'adorait encore. Son amour était celui du
chevalier des Grieux admirant et purifiant sa maîtresse jusque sur la
charrette qui mène en prison les femmes perdues.--Pourquoi mon amour ne
la rendrait-il pas la plus pure de toutes les femmes? Pourquoi
l'abandonner au mal et au vice, sans lui tendre une main amie? Cette
mission lui plut. L'amour fait son profit de tout. Rien ne séduit plus
un jeune homme que de jouer le rôle d'un bon génie auprès d'une femme.
Il y a je ne sais quoi de romanesque dans cette entreprise, qui sied aux
âmes exaltées. N'est-ce pas le dévouement le plus étendu sous la forme
la plus élevée, la plus gracieuse? N'y a-t-il pas quelque grandeur à
savoir que l'on aime assez pour aimer encore là où l'amour des autres
s'éteint et meurt? Hippolyte s'assit dans son atelier, contempla son
tableau sans y rien faire, n'en voyant les figures qu'à travers quelques
larmes qui lui roulaient dans les yeux, tenant toujours sa brosse à la
main, s'avançant vers la toile comme pour adoucir une teinte, et n'y
touchant pas. La nuit le surprit dans cette attitude. Réveillé de sa
rêverie par l'obscurité, il descendit, rencontra le vieil amiral dans
l'escalier, lui jeta un regard sombre en le saluant, et s'enfuit. Il
avait eu l'intention d'entrer chez ses voisines, mais l'aspect du
protecteur d'Adélaïde lui glaça le coeur et fit évanouir sa résolution.
Il se demanda pour la centième fois quel intérêt pouvait amener ce vieil
homme à bonnes fortunes, riche de quatre-vingt mille livres de rentes,
dans ce quatrième étage où il perdait environ quarante francs tous les
soirs; et cet intérêt, il crut le deviner. Le lendemain et les jours
suivants, Hippolyte se jeta dans le travail pour tâcher de combattre sa
passion par l'entraînement des idées et par la fougue de la conception.
Il réussit à demi. L'étude le consola sans parvenir cependant à étouffer
les souvenirs de tant d'heures caressantes passées auprès d'Adélaïde. Un
soir, en quittant son atelier, il trouva la porte de l'appartement des
deux dames entr'ouverte. Une personne y était debout, dans l'embrasure
de la fenêtre. La disposition de la porte et de l'escalier ne permettait
pas au peintre de passer sans voir Adélaïde, il la salua froidement en
lui lançant un regard plein d'indifférence; mais, jugeant des
souffrances de cette jeune fille par les siennes, il eut un
tressaillement intérieur en songeant à l'amertume que ce regard et cette
froideur devaient jeter dans un coeur aimant. Couronner les plus douces
fêtes qui aient jamais réjoui deux âmes pures par un dédain de huit
jours, et par le mépris le plus profond, le plus entier?... affreux
dénouement! Peut-être la bourse était-elle retrouvée, et peut-être
chaque soir Adélaïde avait-elle attendu son ami? Cette pensée si simple,
si naturelle fit éprouver de nouveaux remords à l'amant; il se demanda
si les preuves d'attachement que la jeune fille lui avait données, si
les ravissantes causeries empreintes d'un amour qui l'avait charmé, ne
méritaient pas au moins une enquête, ne valaient pas une justification.
Honteux d'avoir résisté pendant une semaine aux voeux de son coeur, et
se trouvant presque criminel de ce combat, il vint le soir même chez
madame de Rouville. Tous ses soupçons, toutes ses pensées mauvaises
s'évanouirent à l'aspect de la jeune fille pâle et maigrie.
--Eh, bon Dieu! qu'avez-vous donc? lui dit-il après avoir salué la
baronne.
Adélaïde ne lui répondit rien, mais elle lui jeta un regard plein de
mélancolie, un regard triste, découragé qui lui fit mal.
--Vous avez sans doute beaucoup travaillé, dit la vieille dame, vous
êtes changé. Nous sommes la cause de votre réclusion. Ce portrait aura
retardé quelques tableaux importants pour votre réputation.
Hippolyte fut heureux de trouver une si bonne excuse à son impolitesse.
--Oui, dit-il, j'ai été fort occupé, mais j'ai souffert...
A ces mots, Adélaïde leva la tête, regarda son amant, et ses yeux
inquiets ne lui reprochèrent plus rien.
--Vous nous avez donc supposées bien indifférentes à ce qui peut vous
arriver d'heureux ou de malheureux? dit la vieille dame.
--J'ai eu tort, reprit-il. Cependant il est de ces peines que l'on ne
saurait confier à qui que ce soit, même à un sentiment moins jeune que
ne l'est celui dont vous m'honorez...
--La sincérité, la force de l'amitié ne doivent pas se mesurer d'après
le temps. J'ai vu de vieux amis ne pas se donner une larme dans le
malheur, dit la baronne en hochant la tête.
--Mais qu'avez-vous donc? demanda le jeune homme à Adélaïde.
--Oh! rien, répondit la baronne. Adélaïde a passé quelques nuits pour
achever un ouvrage de femme, et n'a pas voulu m'écouter lorsque je lui
disais qu'un jour de plus ou de moins importait peu...
Hippolyte n'écoutait pas. En voyant ces deux figures si nobles, si
calmes, il rougissait de ses soupçons, et attribuait la perte de sa
bourse à quelque hasard inconnu. Cette soirée fut délicieuse pour lui,
et peut-être aussi pour elle. Il y a de ces secrets que les âmes jeunes
entendent si bien! Adélaïde devinait les pensées d'Hippolyte. Sans
vouloir avouer ses torts, le peintre les reconnaissait, il revenait à sa
maîtresse plus aimant, plus affectueux, en essayant ainsi d'acheter un
pardon tacite. Adélaïde savourait des joies si parfaites, si douces
qu'elles ne lui semblaient pas trop payées par tout le malheur qui avait
si cruellement froissé son âme. L'accord si vrai de leurs coeurs, cette
entente pleine de magie, fut néanmoins troublée par un mot de la baronne
de Rouville.
--Faisons-nous notre petite partie? dit-elle, car mon vieux Kergarouët
me tient rigueur.
Cette phrase réveilla toutes les craintes du jeune peintre, qui rougit
en regardant la mère d'Adélaïde; mais il ne vit sur ce visage que
l'expression d'une bonhomie sans fausseté: nulle arrière-pensée n'en
détruisait le charme, la finesse n'en était point perfide; la malice en
semblait douce, et nul remords n'en altérait le calme. Il se mit alors à
la table de jeu. Adélaïde voulut partager le sort du peintre, en
prétendant qu'il ne connaissait pas le piquet, et avait besoin d'un
partner. Madame de Rouville et sa fille se firent, pendant la partie,
des signes d'intelligence qui inquiétèrent d'autant plus Hippolyte qu'il
gagnait; mais à la fin, un dernier coup rendit les deux amants débiteurs
de la baronne. En voulant chercher de la monnaie dans son gousset, le
peintre retira ses mains de dessus la table, et vit alors devant lui une
bourse qu'Adélaïde y avait glissée sans qu'il s'en aperçût; la pauvre
enfant tenait l'ancienne, et s'occupait par contenance à y chercher de
l'argent pour payer sa mère. Tout le sang d'Hippolyte afflua si vivement
à son coeur qu'il faillit perdre connaissance. La bourse neuve
substituée à la sienne, et qui contenait ses quinze louis, était brodée
en perles d'or. Les coulants, les glands, tout attestait le bon goût
d'Adélaïde, qui sans doute avait épuisé son pécule aux ornements de ce
charmant ouvrage. Il était impossible de dire avec plus de finesse que
le don du peintre ne pouvait être récompensé que par un témoignage de
tendresse. Quand Hippolyte, accablé de bonheur, tourna les yeux sur
Adélaïde et sur la baronne, il les vit tremblantes de plaisir et
heureuses de cette aimable supercherie. Il se trouva petit, mesquin,
niais; il aurait voulu pouvoir se punir: se déchirer le coeur. Quelques
larmes lui vinrent aux yeux, il se leva par un mouvement irrésistible,
prit Adélaïde dans ses bras, la serra contre son coeur, lui ravit un
baiser; puis, avec une bonne foi d'artiste:--Je vous la demande pour
femme, s'écria-t-il en regardant la baronne.
Adélaïde jetait sur le peintre des yeux à demi courroucés, et madame de
Rouville un peu étonnée cherchait une réponse, quand cette scène fut
interrompue par le bruit de la sonnette. Le vieux vice-amiral apparut
suivi de son ombre et de madame Schinner. Après avoir deviné la cause
des chagrins que son fils essayait vainement de lui cacher, la mère
d'Hippolyte avait pris des renseignements auprès de quelques-uns de ses
amis sur Adélaïde. Justement alarmée des calomnies qui pesaient sur
cette jeune fille à l'insu du comte de Kergarouët dont le nom lui fut
dit par la portière, elle avait été les conter au vice-amiral, qui dans
sa colère «voulait aller, disait-il, couper les oreilles à ces
bélîtres.» Animé par son courroux, il avait appris à madame Schinner le
secret des pertes volontaires qu'il faisait au jeu, puisque la fierté de
la baronne ne lui laissait que cet ingénieux moyen de la secourir.
Lorsque madame Schinner eut salué madame de Rouville, celle-ci regarda
le comte de Kergarouët, le chevalier du Halga, l'ancien ami de la feue
comtesse de Kergarouët, Hippolyte, Adélaïde, et dit avec la grâce du
coeur:--Il paraît que nous sommes en famille ce soir.
  Paris, mai 1832.
LA VENDETTA.
  DÉDIÉ A PUTTINATI,
  SCULPTEUR MILANAIS.
En 1800, vers la fin du mois d'octobre, un étranger, suivi d'une femme
et d'une petite fille, arriva devant les Tuileries à Paris, et se tint
assez long-temps auprès des décombres d'une maison récemment démolie, à
l'endroit où s'élève aujourd'hui l'aile commencée qui devait unir le
château de Catherine de Médicis au Louvre des Valois. Il resta là,
debout, les bras croisés, la tête inclinée et la relevait parfois pour
regarder alternativement le palais consulaire, et sa femme assise auprès
de lui sur une pierre. Quoique l'inconnue parût ne s'occuper que de la
petite fille âgée de neuf à dix ans dont les longs cheveux noirs étaient
comme un amusement entre ses mains, elle ne perdait aucun des regards
que lui adressait son compagnon. Un même sentiment, autre que l'amour,
unissait ces deux êtres, et animait d'une même inquiétude leurs
mouvements et leurs pensées. La misère est peut-être le plus puissant de
tous les liens. Cette petite fille semblait être le dernier fruit de
leur union. L'étranger avait une de ces têtes abondantes en cheveux,
larges et graves, qui se sont souvent offertes au pinceau des Carraches.
Ces cheveux si noirs étaient mélangés d'une grande quantité de cheveux
blancs. Quoique nobles et fiers, ses traits avaient un ton de dureté qui
les gâtait. Malgré sa force et sa taille droite, il paraissait avoir
plus de soixante ans. Ses vêtements délabrés annonçaient qu'il venait
d'un pays étranger. Quoique la figure jadis belle et alors flétrie de la
femme trahît une tristesse profonde, quand son mari la regardait elle
s'efforçait de sourire en affectant une contenance calme. La petite
fille restait debout, malgré la fatigue dont les marques frappaient
son jeune visage hâlé par le soleil. Elle avait une tournure italienne,
de grands yeux noirs sous des sourcils bien arqués; une noblesse native,
une grâce vraie. Plus d'un passant se sentait ému au seul aspect de ce
groupe dont les personnages ne faisaient aucun effort pour cacher un
désespoir aussi profond que l'expression en était simple; mais la source
de cette fugitive obligeance qui distingue les Parisiens se tarissait
promptement. Aussitôt que l'inconnu se croyait l'objet de l'attention de
quelque oisif, il le regardait d'un air si farouche, que le flâneur le
plus intrépide hâtait le pas comme s'il eût marché sur un serpent. Après
être demeuré long-temps indécis, tout à coup le grand étranger passa la
main sur son front, il en chassa, pour ainsi dire, les pensées qui
l'avaient sillonné de rides, et prit sans doute un parti désespéré.
Après avoir jeté un regard perçant sur sa femme et sur sa fille, il tira
de sa veste un long poignard, le tendit à sa compagne, et lui dit en
italien:--Je vais voir si les Bonaparte se souviennent de nous. Et il
marcha d'un pas lent et assuré vers l'entrée du palais, où il fut
naturellement arrêté par un soldat de la garde consulaire avec lequel il
ne put long-temps discuter. En s'apercevant de l'obstination de
l'inconnu, la sentinelle lui présenta sa baïonnette en manière
d'_ultimatum_. Le hasard voulut que l'on vînt en ce moment relever le
soldat de sa faction, et le caporal indiqua fort obligeamment à
l'étranger l'endroit où se tenait le commandant du poste.
[Illustration: IMP. E. MARTINET.
GINEVRA DE PIOMBO.
Elle prit une feuille de papier et se mit à croquer à la sépia la
tête du pauvre reclus.
(LA VENDETTA.)]
--Faites savoir à Bonaparte que Bartholoméo di Piombo voudrait lui
parler, dit l'Italien au capitaine de service.
Cet officier eut beau représenter à Bartholoméo qu'on ne voyait pas le
premier consul sans lui avoir préalablement demandé par écrit une
audience, l'étranger voulut absolument que le militaire allât prévenir
Bonaparte. L'officier objecta les lois de la consigne, et refusa
formellement d'obtempérer à l'ordre de ce singulier solliciteur.
Bartholoméo fronça le sourcil, jeta sur le commandant un regard
terrible, et sembla le rendre responsable des malheurs que ce refus
pouvait occasionner; puis, il garda le silence, se croisa fortement les
bras sur la poitrine, et alla se placer sous le portique qui sert de
communication entre la cour et le jardin des Tuileries. Les gens qui
veulent fortement une chose sont presque toujours bien servis par le
hasard. Au moment où Bartholoméo di Piombo s'asseyait sur une des bornes
qui sont auprès de l'entrée des Tuileries, il arriva une voiture d'où
descendit Lucien Bonaparte, alors ministre de l'intérieur.
--Ah! Loucian, il est bien heureux pour moi de te rencontrer, s'écria
l'étranger.
Ces mots, prononcés en patois corse, arrêtèrent Lucien au moment où il
s'élançait sous la voûte, il regarda son compatriote et le reconnut. Au
premier mot que Bartholoméo lui dit à l'oreille, il emmena le Corse avec
lui chez Bonaparte. Murat, Lannes, Rapp se trouvaient dans le cabinet du
premier consul. En voyant entrer Lucien, suivi d'un homme aussi
singulier que l'était Piombo, la conversation cessa, Lucien prit
Napoléon par la main et le conduisit dans l'embrasure de la croisée.
Après avoir échangé quelques paroles avec son frère, le premier consul
fit un geste de main auquel obéirent Murat et Lannes en s'en allant.
Rapp feignit de n'avoir rien vu, afin de pouvoir rester. Bonaparte
l'ayant interpellé vivement, l'aide-de-camp sortit en rechignant. Le
premier consul, qui entendit le bruit des pas de Rapp dans le salon
voisin, sortit brusquement et le vit près du mur qui séparait le cabinet
du salon.
--Tu ne veux donc pas me comprendre? dit le premier consul. J'ai besoin
d'être seul avec mon compatriote.
--Un Corse, répondit l'aide-de-camp. Je me défie trop de ces gens-là
pour ne pas...
Le premier consul ne put s'empêcher de sourire, et poussa légèrement son
fidèle officier par les épaules.
--Eh bien, que viens-tu faire ici, mon pauvre Bartholoméo? dit le
premier consul à Piombo.
--Te demander asile et protection, si tu es un vrai Corse, répondit
Bartholoméo d'un ton brusque.
--Quel malheur a pu te chasser du pays? tu en étais le plus riche, le
plus...
--J'ai tué tous les Porta, répliqua le Corse d'un son de voix profond en
fronçant les sourcils.
Le premier consul fit deux pas en arrière comme un homme surpris.
Vas-tu me trahir? s'écria Bartholoméo en jetant un regard sombre à
Bonaparte. Sais-tu que nous sommes encore quatre Piombo en Corse?
Lucien prit le bras de son compatriote, et le secoua.
--Viens-tu donc ici pour menacer le sauveur de la France? lui dit-il
vivement.
Bonaparte fit un signe à Lucien, qui se tut. Puis il regarda Piombo, et
lui dit:--Pourquoi donc as-tu tué les Porta?
--Nous avions fait amitié, répondit-il, les Barbanti nous avaient
réconciliés. Le lendemain du jour où nous trinquâmes pour noyer nos
querelles, je les quittai parce que j'avais affaire à Bastia. Ils
restèrent chez moi, et mirent le feu à ma vigne de Longone. Ils ont tué
mon fils Grégorio. Ma fille Ginevra et ma femme leur ont échappé; elles
avaient communié le matin, la Vierge les a protégées. Quand je revins,
je ne trouvai plus ma maison, je la cherchais les pieds dans ses
cendres. Tout à coup je heurtai le corps de Grégorio, que je reconnus à
la lueur de la lune.--Oh! les Porta ont fait le coup! me dis-je. J'allai
sur-le-champ dans les _mâquis_, j'y rassemblai quelques hommes auxquels
j'avais rendu service, entends-tu, Bonaparte? et nous marchâmes sur la
vigne des Porta. Nous sommes arrivés à cinq heures du matin, à sept ils
étaient tous devant Dieu. Giacomo prétend qu'Élisa Vanni a sauvé un
enfant, le petit Luigi; mais je l'avais attaché moi-même dans son lit
avant de mettre le feu à la maison. J'ai quitté l'île avec ma femme et
ma fille, sans avoir pu vérifier s'il était vrai que Luigi Porta vécût
encore.
Bonaparte regardait Bartholoméo avec curiosité, mais sans étonnement.
--Combien étaient-ils? demanda Lucien.
--Sept, répondit Piombo. Ils ont été vos persécuteurs dans les temps,
leur dit-il. Ces mots ne réveillèrent aucune expression de haine chez
les deux frères.--Ah! vous n'êtes plus Corses, s'écria Bartholoméo avec
une sorte de désespoir. Adieu. Autrefois je vous ai protégés,
ajouta-t-il d'un ton de reproche. Sans moi, ta mère ne serait pas
arrivée à Marseille, dit-il en s'adressant à Bonaparte qui restait
pensif le coude appuyé sur le manteau de la cheminée.
--En conscience, Piombo, répondit Napoléon, je ne puis pas te prendre
sous mon aile. Je suis devenu le chef d'une grande nation, je commande
la république, et dois faire exécuter les lois.
--Ah! ah! dit Bartholoméo.
--Mais je puis fermer les yeux, reprit Bonaparte. Le préjugé de la
_Vendetta_ empêchera long-temps le règne des lois en Corse, ajouta-t-il
en se parlant à lui-même. Il faut cependant le détruire à tout prix.
Bonaparte resta un moment silencieux, et Lucien fit signe à Piombo de ne
rien dire. Le Corse agitait déjà la tête de droite et de gauche d'un air
improbateur.
--Demeure ici, reprit le consul en s'adressant à Bartholoméo, nous n'en
saurons rien. Je ferai acheter tes propriétés afin de te donner d'abord
les moyens de vivre. Puis, dans quelque temps, plus tard, nous penserons
à toi. Mais plus de _Vendetta_! Il n'y a pas de mâquis ici. Si tu y
joues du poignard, il n'y aurait pas de grâce à espérer. Ici la loi
protège tous les citoyens, et l'on ne se fait pas justice soi-même.
--Il s'est fait chef d'un singulier pays, répondit Bartholoméo en
prenant la main de Lucien et la serrant. Mais vous me reconnaissez dans
le malheur, ce sera maintenant entre nous à la vie à la mort, et vous
pouvez disposer de tous les Piombo.
A ces mots, le front du Corse se dérida, et il regarda autour de lui
avec satisfaction.
--Vous n'êtes pas mal ici, dit-il en souriant, comme s'il voulait y
loger. Et tu es habillé tout en rouge comme un cardinal.
--Il ne tiendra qu'à toi de parvenir et d'avoir un palais à Paris, dit
Bonaparte qui toisait son compatriote. Il m'arrivera plus d'une fois de
regarder autour de moi pour chercher un ami dévoué auquel je puisse me
confier.
Un soupir de joie sortit de la vaste poitrine de Piombo qui tendit la
main au premier consul en lui disant:--Il y a encore du Corse en toi!
Bonaparte sourit. Il regarda silencieusement cet homme, qui lui
apportait en quelque sorte l'air de sa patrie, de cette île où naguère
il avait été sauvé si miraculeusement de la haine du _parti anglais_, et
qu'il ne devait plus revoir. Il fit un signe à son frère, qui emmena
Bartholoméo di Piombo. Lucien s'enquit avec intérêt de la situation
financière de l'ancien protecteur de leur famille. Piombo amena le
ministre de l'intérieur auprès d'une fenêtre, et lui montra sa femme et
Ginevra, assises toutes deux sur un tas de pierres.
--Nous sommes venus de Fontainebleau ici à pied, et nous n'avons pas une
obole, lui dit-il.
Lucien donna sa bourse à son compatriote et lui recommanda de venir le
trouver le lendemain afin d'aviser aux moyens d'assurer le sort de sa
famille. La valeur de tous les biens que Piombo possédait en Corse ne
pouvait guère le faire vivre honorablement à Paris.
Quinze ans s'écoulèrent entre l'arrivée de la famille Piombo à Paris, et
l'aventure suivante, qui, sans le récit de ces événements, eût été moins
intelligible.
Servin, l'un de nos artistes les plus distingués, conçut le premier
l'idée d'ouvrir un atelier pour les jeunes personnes qui veulent prendre
des leçons de peinture. Agé d'une quarantaine d'années, de moeurs pures
et entièrement livré à son art, il avait épousé par inclination la fille
d'un général sans fortune. Les mères conduisirent d'abord elles-mêmes
leurs filles chez le professeur; puis elles finirent par les y envoyer
quand elles eurent bien connu ses principes et apprécié le soin qu'il
mettait à mériter la confiance. Il était entré dans le plan du peintre
de n'accepter pour écolières que des demoiselles appartenant à des
familles riches ou considérées afin de n'avoir pas de reproches à subir
sur la composition de son atelier; il se refusait même à prendre les
jeunes filles qui voulaient devenir artistes et auxquelles il aurait
fallu donner certains enseignements sans lesquels il n'est pas de talent
possible en peinture. Insensiblement sa prudence, la supériorité avec
lesquelles il initiait ses élèves aux secrets de l'art, la certitude où
les mères étaient de savoir leurs filles en compagnie de jeunes
personnes bien élevées et la sécurité qu'inspiraient le caractère, les
moeurs, le mariage de l'artiste, lui valurent dans les salons une
excellente renommée. Quand une jeune fille manifestait le désir
d'apprendre à peindre ou à dessiner, et que sa mère demandait
conseil:--Envoyez-la chez Servin! était la réponse de chacun. Servin
devint donc pour la peinture féminine une spécialité, comme Herbault
pour les chapeaux, Leroy pour les modes et Chevet pour les comestibles.
Il était reconnu qu'une jeune femme qui avait pris des leçons chez
Servin pouvait juger en dernier ressort les tableaux du Musée, faire
supérieurement un portrait, copier une toile et peindre son tableau de
genre. Cet artiste suffisait ainsi à tous les besoins de l'aristocratie.
Malgré les rapports qu'il avait avec les meilleures maisons de Paris, il
était indépendant, patriote, et conservait avec tout le monde ce ton
léger, spirituel, parfois ironique, cette liberté de jugement qui
distinguent les peintres. Il avait poussé le scrupule de ses
précautions jusque dans l'ordonnance du local où étudiaient ses
écolières. L'entrée du grenier qui régnait au-dessus de ses appartements
avait été murée. Pour parvenir à cette retraite, aussi sacrée qu'un
harem, il fallait monter par un escalier pratiqué dans l'intérieur de
son logement. L'atelier, qui occupait tout le comble de la maison,
offrait ces proportions énormes qui surprennent toujours les curieux
quand, arrivés à soixante pieds du sol, ils s'attendent à voir les
artistes logés dans une gouttière. Cette espèce de galerie était
profusément éclairée par d'immenses châssis vitrés et garnis de ces
grandes toiles vertes à l'aide desquelles les peintres disposent de la
lumière. Une foule de caricatures, de têtes faites au trait, avec de la
couleur ou la pointe d'un couteau, sur les murailles peintes en gris
foncé, prouvaient, sauf la différence de l'expression, que les filles
les plus distinguées ont dans l'esprit autant de folie que les hommes
peuvent en avoir. Un petit poêle et ses grands tuyaux, qui décrivaient
un effroyable zigzag avant d'atteindre les hautes régions du toit,
étaient l'infaillible ornement de cet atelier. Une planche régnait
autour des murs et soutenait des modèles en plâtre qui gisaient
confusément placés, la plupart couverts d'une blonde poussière.
Au-dessous de ce rayon, çà et là, une tête de Niobé pendue à un clou
montrait sa pose de douleur, une Vénus souriait, une main se présentait
brusquement aux yeux comme celle d'un pauvre demandant l'aumône, puis
quelques _écorchés_ jaunis par la fumée avaient l'air de membres
arrachés la veille à des cercueils; enfin des tableaux, des dessins, des
mannequins, des cadres sans toiles et des toiles sans cadres achevaient
de donner à cette pièce irrégulière la physionomie d'un atelier que
distingue un singulier mélange d'ornement et de nudité, de misère et de
richesse, de soin et d'incurie. Cet immense vaisseau, où tout paraît
petit même l'homme, sent la coulisse d'opéra; il s'y trouve de vieux
linges, des armures dorées, des lambeaux d'étoffe, des machines; mais il
y a je ne sais quoi de grand comme la pensée: le génie et la mort sont
là; la Diane ou l'Apollon auprès d'un crâne ou d'un squelette, le beau
et le désordre, la poésie et la réalité, de riches couleurs dans
l'ombre, et souvent tout un drame immobile et silencieux. Quel symbole
d'une tête d'artiste!
Au moment où commence cette histoire, le brillant soleil du mois de
juillet illuminait l'atelier, et deux rayons le traversaient dans sa
profondeur en y traçant de larges bandes d'or diaphanes où brillaient
des grains de poussière. Une douzaine de chevalets élevaient leurs
flèches aiguës, semblables à des mâts de vaisseau dans un port.
Plusieurs jeunes filles animaient cette scène par la variété de leurs
physionomies, de leurs attitudes, et par la différence de leurs
toilettes. Les fortes ombres que jetaient les serges vertes, placées
suivant les besoins de chaque chevalet, produisaient une multitude de
contrastes, de piquants effets de clair-obscur. Ce groupe formait le
plus beau de tous les tableaux de l'atelier. Une jeune fille blonde et
mise simplement se tenait loin de ses compagnes, travaillait avec
courage en paraissant prévoir le malheur; nulle ne la regardait, ne lui
adressait la parole: elle était la plus jolie, la plus modeste et la
moins riche. Deux groupes principaux, séparés l'un de l'autre par une
faible distance, indiquaient deux sociétés, deux esprits jusque dans cet
atelier où les rangs et la fortune auraient dû s'oublier. Assises ou
debout, ces jeunes filles, entourées de leurs boîtes à couleurs, jouant
avec leurs pinceaux ou les préparant, maniant leurs éclatantes palettes,
peignant, parlant, riant, chantant, abandonnées à leur naturel, laissant
voir leur caractère, composaient un spectacle inconnu aux hommes:
celle-ci, fière, hautaine, capricieuse, aux cheveux noirs, aux belles
mains, lançait au hasard la flamme de ses regards; celle-là, insouciante
et gaie, le sourire sur les lèvres, les cheveux châtains, les mains
blanches et délicates, vierge française, légère, sans arrière-pensée,
vivant de sa vie actuelle; une autre, rêveuse, mélancolique, pâle,
penchant la tête comme une fleur qui tombe; sa voisine, au contraire,
grande, indolente, aux habitudes musulmanes, l'oeil long, noir, humide;
parlant peu, mais songeant et regardant à la dérobée la tête d'Antinoüs.
Au milieu d'elles, comme le _jocoso_ d'une pièce espagnole, pleine
d'esprit et de saillies épigrammatiques, une fille les espionnait toutes
d'un seul coup d'oeil, les faisait rire et levait sans cesse sa figure
trop vive pour n'être pas jolie; elle commandait au premier groupe des
écolières qui comprenait les filles de banquier, de notaire et de
négociant; toutes riches, mais essuyant toutes les dédains
imperceptibles quoique poignants que leur prodiguaient les autres jeunes
personnes appartenant à l'aristocratie. Celles-ci étaient gouvernées par
la fille d'un huissier du cabinet du roi, petite créature aussi sotte
que vaine, et fière d'avoir pour père un homme _ayant une charge_ à la
Cour: elle voulait toujours paraître avoir compris du premier coup les
observations du maître et semblait travailler par grâce; elle se servait
d'un lorgnon, ne venait que très parée, tard, et suppliait ses compagnes
de parler bas. Dans ce second groupe, on eût remarqué des tailles
délicieuses, des figures distinguées; mais les regards de ces jeunes
filles offraient peu de naïveté. Si leurs attitudes étaient élégantes et
leurs mouvements gracieux, les figures manquaient de franchise, et l'on
devinait facilement qu'elles appartenaient à un monde où la politesse
façonne de bonne heure les caractères, où l'abus des jouissances
sociales tue les sentiments et développe l'égoïsme. Lorsque cette
réunion était complète, il se trouvait dans le nombre de ces jeunes
filles des têtes enfantines, des vierges d'une pureté ravissante, des
visages dont la bouche légèrement entr'ouverte laissait voir des dents
vierges, et sur laquelle errait un sourire de vierge. L'atelier ne
ressemblait pas alors à un sérail, mais à un groupe d'anges assis sur un
nuage dans le ciel.
Il était environ midi, Servin n'avait pas encore paru, ses écolières
savaient qu'il achevait un tableau pour l'exposition. Depuis quelques
jours, la plupart du temps il restait à un atelier qu'il avait ailleurs.
Tout à coup, mademoiselle Amélie Thirion, chef du parti aristocratique
de cette petite assemblée, parla long-temps à sa voisine, et il se fit
un grand silence dans le groupe des patriciennes. Le parti de la banque,
étonné, se tut également, et tâcha de deviner le sujet d'une semblable
conférence. Le secret des jeunes _ultrà_ fut bientôt connu. Amélie se
leva, prit à quelques pas d'elle un chevalet qu'elle alla placer à une
assez grande distance du noble groupe, près d'une cloison grossière qui
séparait l'atelier d'un cabinet obscur où l'on jetait les plâtres
brisés, les toiles condamnées par le professeur, et où se mettait la
provision de bois en hiver. L'action d'Amélie devait être bien hardie,
car elle excita un murmure de surprise. La jeune élégante n'en tint
compte, et acheva d'opérer le déménagement de sa compagne absente en
roulant vivement près du chevalet la boîte à couleur et le tabouret,
enfin tout, jusqu'à un tableau de Prudhon que copiait l'élève en retard.
Ce coup d'état excita une stupéfaction générale. Si le côté droit se mit
à travailler silencieusement, le côté gauche pérora longuement.
--Que va dire mademoiselle Piombo, demanda une jeune fille à
mademoiselle Mathilde Roguin, l'oracle malicieux du premier groupe.
--Elle n'est pas fille à parler, répondit-elle; mais dans cinquante ans
elle se souviendra de cette injure comme si elle l'avait reçue la
veille, et saura s'en venger cruellement. C'est une personne avec
laquelle je ne voudrais pas être en guerre.
--La proscription dont la frappent ces demoiselles est d'autant plus
injuste, dit une autre jeune fille, qu'avant-hier mademoiselle Ginevra
était fort triste; son père venait, dit-on, de donner sa démission. Ce
serait donc ajouter à son malheur, tandis qu'elle a été fort bonne pour
ces demoiselles pendant les Cent-Jours. Leur a-t-elle jamais dit une
parole qui pût les blesser. Elle évitait au contraire de parler
politique. Mais nos Ultras paraissent agir plutôt par jalousie que par
esprit de parti.
--J'ai envie d'aller chercher le chevalet de mademoiselle Piombo, et de
le mettre auprès du mien, dit Mathilde Roguin. Elle se leva, mais une
réflexion la fit rasseoir:--Avec un caractère comme celui de
mademoiselle Ginevra, dit-elle, on ne peut pas savoir de quelle manière
elle prendrait notre politesse, attendons l'événement.
--_Eccola_, dit languissamment la jeune fille aux yeux noirs.
En effet, le bruit des pas d'une personne qui montait l'escalier
retentit dans la salle. Ce mot:--«La voici!» passa de bouche en bouche,
et le plus profond silence régna dans l'atelier.
Pour comprendre l'importance de l'ostracisme exercé par Amélie Thirion,
il est nécessaire d'ajouter que cette scène avait lieu vers la fin du
mois de juillet 1815. Le second retour des Bourbons venait de troubler
bien des amitiés qui avaient résisté au mouvement de la première
restauration. En ce moment les familles étaient presque toutes divisées
d'opinion, et le fanatisme politique renouvelait plusieurs de ces
déplorables scènes qui, aux époques de guerre civile ou religieuse,
souillent l'histoire de tous les pays. Les enfants, les jeunes filles,
les vieillards partageaient la fièvre monarchique à laquelle le
gouvernement était en proie. La discorde se glissait sous tous les
toits, et la défiance teignait de ses sombres couleurs les actions et
les discours les plus intimes. Ginevra Piombo aimait Napoléon avec
idolâtrie, et comment aurait-elle pu le haïr? l'Empereur était son
compatriote et le bienfaiteur de son père. Le baron de Piombo était un
des serviteurs de Napoléon qui avaient coopéré le plus efficacement au
retour de l'île d'Elbe. Incapable de renier sa foi politique, jaloux
même de la confesser, le vieux baron de Piombo restait à Paris au milieu
de ses ennemis. Ginevra Piombo pouvait donc être d'autant mieux mise au
nombre des personnes suspectes, qu'elle ne faisait pas mystère du
chagrin que la seconde restauration causait à sa famille. Les seules
larmes qu'elle eût peut-être versées dans sa vie lui furent arrachées
par la double nouvelle de la captivité de Bonaparte sur _le Bellérophon_
et de l'arrestation de Labédoyère.
Les jeunes personnes qui composaient le groupe des nobles appartenaient
aux familles royalistes les plus exaltées de Paris. Il serait difficile
de donner une idée des exagérations de cette époque et de l'horreur que
causaient les bonapartistes. Quelque insignifiante et petite que puisse
paraître aujourd'hui l'action d'Amélie Thirion, elle était alors une
expression de haine fort naturelle. Ginevra Piombo, l'une des premières
écolières de Servin, occupait la place dont on voulait la priver depuis
le jour où elle était venue à l'atelier; le groupe aristocratique
l'avait insensiblement entourée: la chasser d'une place qui lui
appartenait en quelque sorte était non-seulement lui faire injure, mais
lui causer une espèce de peine; car les artistes ont tous une place de
prédilection pour leur travail. Mais l'animadversion politique entrait
peut-être pour peu de chose dans la conduite de ce petit Côté Droit de
l'atelier. Ginevra Piombo, la plus forte des élèves de Servin, était
l'objet d'une profonde jalousie; le maître professait autant
d'admiration pour les talents que pour le caractère de cette élève
favorite qui servait de terme à toutes ses comparaisons; enfin, sans
qu'on s'expliquât l'ascendant que cette jeune personne obtenait sur tout
ce qui l'entourait, elle exerçait sur ce petit monde un prestige presque
semblable à celui de Bonaparte sur ses soldats. L'aristocratie de
l'atelier avait résolu depuis plusieurs jours la chute de cette reine;
mais, personne n'ayant encore osé s'éloigner de la bonapartiste,
mademoiselle Thirion venait de frapper un coup décisif, afin de rendre
ses compagnes complices de sa haine. Quoique Ginevra fût sincèrement
aimée par deux ou trois des Royalistes, presque toutes chapitrées au
logis paternel relativement à la politique, elles jugèrent, avec ce tact
particulier aux femmes, qu'elles devaient rester indifférentes à la
querelle. A son arrivée, Ginevra fut donc accueillie par un profond
silence. De toutes les jeunes filles venues jusqu'alors dans l'atelier
de Servin, elle était la plus belle, la plus grande et la mieux faite.
Sa démarche possédait un caractère de noblesse et de grâce qui
commandait le respect. Sa figure empreinte d'intelligence semblait
rayonner, tant y respirait cette animation particulière aux Corses et
qui n'exclut point le calme. Ses longs cheveux, ses yeux et ses cils
noirs exprimaient la passion. Quoique les coins de sa bouche se
dessinassent mollement et que ses lèvres fussent un peu trop fortes, il
s'y peignait cette bonté que donne aux êtres forts la conscience de leur
force. Par un singulier caprice de la nature, le charme de son visage se
trouvait en quelque sorte démenti par un front de marbre où se peignait
une fierté presque sauvage, où respiraient les moeurs de la Corse. Là
était le seul lien qu'il y eût entre elle et son pays natal: dans tout
le reste de sa personne, la simplicité, l'abandon des beautés lombardes
séduisaient si bien qu'il fallait ne pas la voir pour lui causer la
moindre peine. Elle inspirait un si vif attrait que, par prudence, son
vieux père la faisait accompagner jusqu'à l'atelier. Le seul défaut de
cette créature véritablement poétique venait de la puissance même d'une
beauté si largement développée: elle avait l'air d'être femme. Elle
s'était refusée au mariage, par amour pour son père et sa mère, en se
sentant nécessaire à leurs vieux jours. Son goût pour la peinture avait
remplacé les passions qui agitent ordinairement les femmes.
--Vous êtes bien silencieuses aujourd'hui, mesdemoiselles, dit-elle
après avoir fait deux ou trois pas au milieu de ses compagnes.--Bonjour,
ma petite Laure, ajouta-t-elle d'un ton doux et caressant en
s'approchant de la jeune fille qui peignait loin des autres. Cette tête
est fort bien! Les chairs sont un peu trop roses, mais tout en est
dessiné à merveille.
Laure leva la tête, regarda Ginevra d'un air attendri, et leurs figures
s'épanouirent en exprimant une même affection. Un faible sourire anima
les lèvres de l'Italienne qui paraissait songeuse, et qui se dirigea
lentement vers sa place en regardant avec nonchalance les dessins ou les
tableaux, en disant bonjour à chacune des jeunes filles du premier
groupe, sans s'apercevoir de la curiosité insolite qu'excitait sa
présence. On eût dit d'une reine dans sa cour. Elle ne donna aucune
attention au profond silence qui régnait parmi les patriciennes, et
passa devant leur camp sans prononcer un seul mot. Sa préoccupation fut
si grande qu'elle se mit à son chevalet, ouvrit sa boîte à couleurs,
prit ses brosses, revêtit ses manches brunes, ajusta son tablier,
regarda son tableau, examina sa palette, sans penser, pour ainsi dire, à
ce qu'elle faisait. Toutes les têtes du groupe des bourgeoises étaient
tournées vers elle. Si les jeunes personnes du camp Thirion ne mettaient
pas tant de franchise que leurs compagnes dans leur impatience, leurs
oeillades n'en étaient pas moins dirigées sur Ginevra.
--Elle ne s'aperçoit de rien, dit mademoiselle Roguin.
En ce moment Ginevra quitta l'attitude méditative dans laquelle elle
avait contemplé sa toile, et tourna la tête vers le groupe
aristocratique. Elle mesura d'un seul coup d'oeil la distance qui l'en
séparait, et garda le silence.
--Elle ne croit pas qu'on ait eu la pensée de l'insulter, dit Mathilde,
elle n'a ni pâli ni rougi. Comme ces demoiselles vont être vexées si
elle se trouve mieux à sa nouvelle place qu'à l'ancienne!
--Vous êtes là hors ligne, mademoiselle, ajouta-t-elle alors à haute
voix en s'adressant à Ginevra.
L'Italienne feignit de ne pas entendre, ou peut-être n'entendit-elle
pas; elle se leva brusquement, longea avec une certaine lenteur la
cloison qui séparait le cabinet noir de l'atelier, et parut examiner le
châssis d'où venait le jour en y donnant tant d'importance qu'elle monta
sur une chaise pour attacher beaucoup plus haut la serge verte qui
interceptait la lumière. Arrivée à cette hauteur, elle atteignit à une
crevasse assez légère dans la cloison, le véritable but de ses efforts,
car le regard qu'elle y jeta ne peut se comparer qu'à celui d'un avare
découvrant les trésors d'Aladin; elle descendit vivement, revint à sa
place, ajusta son tableau, feignit d'être mécontente du jour, approcha
de la cloison une table sur laquelle elle mit une chaise, grimpa
lestement sur cet échafaudage, et regarda de nouveau par la crevasse.
Elle ne jeta qu'un regard dans le cabinet alors éclairé par un jour de
souffrance qu'on avait ouvert, et ce qu'elle y aperçut produisit sur
elle une sensation si vive qu'elle tressaillit.
--Vous allez tomber, mademoiselle Ginevra, s'écria Laure.
Toutes les jeunes filles regardèrent l'imprudente qui chancelait. La
peur de voir arriver ses compagnes auprès d'elle lui donna du courage,
elle retrouva ses forces et son équilibre, se tourna vers Laure en se
dandinant sur sa chaise, et dit d'une voix émue:--Bah! c'est encore un
peu plus solide qu'un trône! Elle se hâta d'arracher la serge,
descendit, repoussa la table et la chaise bien loin de la cloison,
revint à son chevalet, et fit encore quelques essais en ayant l'air de
chercher une masse de lumière qui lui convînt. Son tableau ne l'occupait
guère, son but était de s'approcher du cabinet noir auprès duquel elle
se plaça, comme elle le désirait, à côté de la porte. Puis elle se mit
à préparer sa palette en gardant le plus profond silence. A cette place,
elle entendit bientôt plus distinctement le léger bruit qui, la veille,
avait si fortement excité sa curiosité et fait parcourir à sa jeune
imagination le vaste champ des conjectures. Elle reconnut facilement la
respiration forte et régulière de l'homme endormi qu'elle venait de
voir. Sa curiosité était satisfaite au delà de ses souhaits, mais elle
se trouvait chargée d'une immense responsabilité. A travers la crevasse,
elle avait entrevu l'aigle impériale, et, sur un lit de sangles
faiblement éclairé, la figure d'un officier de la Garde. Elle devina
tout: Servin cachait un proscrit. Maintenant elle tremblait qu'une de
ses compagnes ne vînt examiner son tableau, et n'entendît ou la
respiration de ce malheureux ou quelque aspiration trop forte, comme
celle qui était arrivée à son oreille pendant la dernière leçon. Elle
résolut de rester auprès de cette porte, en se fiant à son adresse pour
déjouer les chances du sort.
--Il vaut mieux que je sois là, pensait-elle, pour prévenir un accident
sinistre, que de laisser le pauvre prisonnier à la merci d'une
étourderie. Tel était le secret de l'indifférence apparente que Ginevra
avait manifestée en trouvant son chevet dérangé; elle en fut
intérieurement enchantée, puisqu'elle avait pu satisfaire assez
naturellement sa curiosité: puis, en ce moment, elle était trop vivement
préoccupée pour chercher la raison de son déménagement. Rien n'est plus
mortifiant pour des jeunes filles, comme pour tout le monde, que de voir
une méchanceté, une insulte ou un bon mot manquant leur effet par suite
du dédain qu'en témoigne la victime. Il semble que la haine envers un
ennemi s'accroisse de toute la hauteur à laquelle il s'élève au-dessus
de nous. La conduite de Ginevra devint une énigme pour toutes ses
compagnes. Ses amies comme ses ennemies furent également surprises; car
on lui accordait toutes les qualités possibles, hormis le pardon des
injures. Quoique les occasions de déployer ce vice de caractère eussent
été rarement offertes à Ginevra dans les événements de la vie d'atelier,
les exemples qu'elle avait pu donner de ses dispositions vindicatives et
de sa fermeté n'en avaient pas moins laissé des impressions profondes
dans l'esprit de ses compagnes. Après bien des conjectures, mademoiselle
Roguin finit par trouver dans le silence de l'Italienne une grandeur
d'âme au-dessus de tout éloge; et son cercle, inspiré par elle, forma le
projet d'humilier l'aristocratie de l'atelier. Elles parvinrent à leur
but par un feu de sarcasmes qui abattit l'orgueil du Côté Droit.
L'arrivée de madame Servin mit fin à cette lutte d'amour-propre. Avec
cette finesse qui accompagne toujours la méchanceté, Amélie avait
remarqué, analysé, commenté la prodigieuse préoccupation qui empêchait
Ginevra d'entendre la dispute aigrement polie dont elle était l'objet.
La vengeance que mademoiselle Roguin et ses compagnes tiraient de
mademoiselle Thirion et de son groupe eut alors le fatal effet de faire
rechercher par les jeunes Ultras la cause du silence que gardait Ginevra
di Piombo. La belle Italienne devint donc le centre de tous les regards,
et fut épiée par ses amies comme par ses ennemies. Il est bien difficile
de cacher la plus petite émotion, le plus léger sentiment, à quinze
jeunes filles curieuses, inoccupées, dont la malice et l'esprit ne
demandent que des secrets à deviner, des intrigues à créer, à déjouer,
et qui savent trouver trop d'interprétations différentes à un geste, à
une oeillade, à une parole, pour ne pas en découvrir la véritable
signification. Aussi le secret de Ginevra di Piombo fut-il bientôt en
grand péril d'être connu. En ce moment la présence de madame Servin
produisit un entr'acte dans le drame qui se jouait sourdement au fond de
ces jeunes coeurs, et dont les sentiments, les pensées, les progrès
étaient exprimés par des phrases presque allégoriques, par de malicieux
coups d'oeil, par des gestes, et par le silence même, souvent plus
intelligible que la parole. Aussitôt que madame Servin entra dans
l'atelier, ses yeux se portèrent sur la porte auprès de laquelle était
Ginevra. Dans les circonstances présentes, ce regard ne fut pas perdu.
Si d'abord aucune des écolières n'y fit attention, plus tard
mademoiselle Thirion s'en souvint, et s'expliqua la défiance, la crainte
et le mystère qui donnèrent alors quelque chose de fauve aux yeux de
madame Servin.
--Mesdemoiselles, dit-elle, monsieur Servin ne pourra pas venir
aujourd'hui. Puis elle complimenta chaque jeune personne, en recevant de
toutes une foule de ces caresses féminines qui sont autant dans la voix
et dans les regards que dans les gestes. Elle arriva promptement auprès
de Ginevra dominée par une inquiétude qu'elle déguisait en vain.
L'Italienne et la femme du peintre se firent un signe de tête amical, et
restèrent toutes deux silencieuses, l'une peignant, l'autre regardant
peindre. La respiration du militaire s'entendait facilement, mais madame
Servin ne parut pas s'en apercevoir; et sa dissimulation était si
grande, que Ginevra fut tentée de l'accuser d'une surdité volontaire.
Cependant l'inconnu se remua dans son lit. L'Italienne regarda fixement
madame Servin, qui lui dit alors, sans que son visage éprouvât la plus
légère altération:--Votre copie est aussi belle que l'original. S'il me
fallait choisir, je serais fort embarrassée.
--Monsieur Servin n'a pas mis sa femme dans la confidence de ce mystère,
pensa Ginevra, qui, après avoir répondu à la jeune femme par un doux
sourire d'incrédulité, fredonna une _canzonetta_ de son pays pour
couvrir le bruit que pourrait faire le prisonnier.
C'était quelque chose de si insolite que d'entendre la studieuse
Italienne chanter, que toutes les jeunes filles surprises la
regardèrent. Plus tard cette circonstance servit de preuve aux
charitables suppositions de la haine. Madame Servin s'en alla bientôt,
et la séance s'acheva sans autres événements. Ginevra laissa partir ses
compagnes et parut vouloir travailler longtemps encore; mais elle
trahissait à son insu son désir de rester seule, car à mesure que les
écolières se préparaient à sortir, elle leur jetait des regards
d'impatience mal déguisée. Mademoiselle Thirion, devenue en peu d'heures
une cruelle ennemie pour celle qui la primait en tout, devina par un
instinct de haine que la fausse application de sa rivale cachait un
mystère. Elle avait été frappée plus d'une fois de l'air attentif avec
lequel Ginevra s'était mise à écouter un bruit que personne n'entendait.
L'expression qu'elle surprit en dernier lieu dans les yeux de
l'Italienne fut pour elle un trait de lumière. Elle s'en alla la
dernière de toutes les écolières et descendit chez madame Servin, avec
laquelle elle causa un instant; puis elle feignit d'avoir oublié son
sac, remonta tout doucement à l'atelier, et aperçut Ginevra grimpée sur
un échafaudage fait à la hâte, et si absorbée dans la contemplation du
militaire inconnu qu'elle n'entendit pas le léger bruit que produisaient
les pas de sa compagne. Il est vrai que, suivant une expression de
Walter Scott, Amélie marchait comme sur des oeufs; elle regagna
promptement la porte de l'atelier et toussa. Ginevra tressaillit, tourna
la tête, vit son ennemie, rougit, s'empressa de détacher la serge pour
donner le change sur ses intentions, et descendit après avoir rangé sa
boîte à couleurs. Elle quitta l'atelier en emportant gravée dans son
souvenir l'image d'une tête d'homme aussi gracieuse que celle de
l'Endymion, chef-d'oeuvre de Girodet qu'elle avait copié quelques jours
auparavant.
--Proscrire un homme si jeune! Qui donc peut-il être? car ce n'est pas
le maréchal Ney.
Ces deux phrases sont l'expression la plus simple de toutes les idées
que Ginevra commenta pendant deux jours. Le surlendemain, malgré sa
diligence pour arriver la première à l'atelier, elle y trouva
mademoiselle Thirion qui s'y était fait conduire en voiture. Ginevra et
son ennemie s'observèrent longtemps; mais elles se composèrent des
visages impénétrables l'une pour l'autre. Amélie avait vu la tête
ravissante de l'inconnu; mais, heureusement et malheureusement tout à la
fois, les aigles et l'uniforme n'étaient pas placés dans l'espace que la
fente lui avait permis d'apercevoir. Elle se perdit alors en
conjectures. Tout à coup Servin arriva beaucoup plus tôt qu'à
l'ordinaire.
--Mademoiselle Ginevra, dit-il après avoir jeté un coup d'oeil sur
l'atelier, pourquoi vous êtes-vous mise là? Le jour est mauvais.
Approchez-vous donc de ces demoiselles, et descendez un peu votre
rideau.
Puis il s'assit auprès de Laure, dont le travail méritait ses plus
complaisantes corrections.
--Comment donc! s'écria-t-il, voici une tête supérieurement faite. Vous
serez une seconde Ginevra.
Le maître alla de chevalet en chevalet, grondant, flattant, plaisantant,
et faisant, comme toujours, craindre plutôt ses plaisanteries que ses
réprimandes. L'Italienne n'avait pas obéi aux observations du
professeur, et restait à son poste avec la ferme intention de ne pas
s'en écarter. Elle prit une feuille de papier et se mit à _croquer_ à la
sépia la tête du pauvre reclus. Une oeuvre conçue avec passion porte
toujours un cachet particulier. La faculté d'imprimer aux traductions de
la nature ou de la pensée des couleurs vraies constitue le génie, et
souvent la passion en tient lieu. Aussi, dans la circonstance où se
trouvait Ginevra, l'intuition qu'elle devait à sa mémoire vivement
frappée, ou la nécessité peut-être, cette mère des grandes choses, lui
prêta-t-elle un talent surnaturel. La tête de l'officier fut jetée sur
le papier au milieu d'un tressaillement intérieur qu'elle attribuait à
la crainte, et dans lequel un physiologiste aurait reconnu la fièvre de
l'inspiration. Elle glissait de temps en temps un regard furtif sur ses
compagnes, afin de pouvoir cacher le lavis en cas d'indiscrétion de leur
part. Malgré son active surveillance, il y eut un moment où elle
n'aperçut pas le lorgnon que son impitoyable ennemie braquait sur le
mystérieux dessin, en s'abritant derrière un grand portefeuille.
Mademoiselle Thirion, qui reconnut la figure du proscrit, leva
brusquement la tête, et Ginevra serra la feuille de papier.
--Pourquoi êtes-vous donc restée là malgré mon avis, mademoiselle?
demanda gravement le professeur à Ginevra.
L'écolière tourna vivement son chevalet de manière que personne ne pût
voir son lavis, et dit d'une voix émue en le montrant à son maître:--Ne
trouvez-vous pas comme moi que ce jour est plus favorable? ne dois-je
pas rester là?
Servin pâlit. Comme rien n'échappe aux yeux perçants de la haine,
mademoiselle Thirion se mit, pour ainsi dire, en tiers dans les émotions
qui agitèrent le maître et l'écolière.
--Vous avez raison, dit Servin. Mais vous en saurez bientôt plus que
moi, ajouta-t-il en riant forcément. Il y eut une pause pendant laquelle
le professeur contempla la tête de l'officier.--Ceci est un
chef-d'oeuvre digne de Salvator Rosa, s'écria-t-il avec une énergie
d'artiste.
A cette exclamation, toutes les jeunes personnes se levèrent, et
mademoiselle Thirion accourut avec la vélocité du tigre qui se jette sur
sa proie. En ce moment le proscrit éveillé par le bruit se remua.
Ginevra fit tomber son tabouret, prononça des phrases assez incohérentes
et se mit à rire; mais elle avait plié le portrait et l'avait jeté dans
son portefeuille avant que sa redoutable ennemie eût pu l'apercevoir. Le
chevalet fut entouré, Servin détailla à haute voix les beautés de la
copie que faisait en ce moment son élève favorite, et tout le monde fut
dupe de ce stratagème, moins Amélie qui, se plaçant en arrière de ses
compagnes, essaya d'ouvrir le portefeuille où elle avait vu mettre le
lavis. Ginevra saisit le carton et le plaça devant elle sans mot dire.
Les deux jeunes filles s'examinèrent alors en silence.
Allons, mesdemoiselles, à vos places, dit Servin. Si vous voulez en
savoir autant que mademoiselle de Piombo, il ne faut pas toujours parler
modes ou bals et baguenauder comme vous faites.
Quand toutes les jeunes personnes eurent regagné leurs chevalets, Servin
s'assit auprès de Ginevra.
--Ne valait-il pas mieux que ce mystère fût découvert par moi que par
une autre? dit l'Italienne en parlant à voix basse.
--Oui, répondit le peintre. Vous êtes patriote; mais, ne le fussiez-vous
pas, ce serait encore vous à qui je l'aurais confié.
--Le maître et l'écolière se comprirent, et Ginevra ne craignit plus de
demander:--Qui est-ce?
--L'ami intime de Labédoyère, celui qui, après l'infortuné colonel, a
contribué le plus à la réunion du septième avec les grenadiers de l'île
d'Elbe. Il était chef d'escadron dans la Garde, et revient de Waterloo.
--Comment n'avez-vous pas brûlé son uniforme, son shako, et ne lui
avez-vous pas donné des habits bourgeois? dit vivement Ginevra.
--On doit m'en apporter ce soir.
--Vous auriez dû fermer notre atelier pendant quelques jours.
--Il va partir.
--Il veut donc mourir? dit la jeune fille. Laissez-le chez vous pendant
le premier moment de la tourmente. Paris est encore le seul endroit de
la France où l'on puisse cacher sûrement un homme. Il est votre ami?
demanda-t-elle.
--Non, il n'a pas d'autres titres à ma recommandation que son malheur.
Voici comment il m'est tombé sur les bras: mon beau-père, qui avait
repris du service pendant cette campagne, a rencontré ce pauvre jeune
homme, et l'a très-subtilement sauvé des griffes de ceux qui ont arrêté
Labédoyère. Il voulait le défendre, l'insensé!
--C'est vous qui le nommez ainsi! s'écria Ginevra en lançant un regard
de surprise au peintre, qui garda le silence un moment.
--Mon beau-père est trop espionné pour pouvoir garder quelqu'un chez
lui, reprit-il. Il me l'a donc nuitamment amené la semaine dernière.
J'avais espéré le dérober à tous les yeux en le mettant dans ce coin, le
seul endroit de la maison où il puisse être en sûreté.
--Si je puis vous être utile, employez-moi, dit Ginevra, je connais le
maréchal Feltre.
--Eh bien! nous verrons, répondit le peintre.
Cette conversation dura trop longtemps pour ne pas être remarquée de
toutes les jeunes filles. Servin quitta Ginevra, revint encore à chaque
chevalet, et donna de si longues leçons qu'il était encore sur
l'escalier quand sonna l'heure à laquelle ses écolières avaient
l'habitude de partir.
--Vous oubliez votre sac, mademoiselle Thirion, s'écria le professeur en
courant après la jeune fille, qui descendait jusqu'au métier d'espion
pour satisfaire sa haine.
La curieuse élève vint chercher son sac en manifestant un peu de
surprise de son étourderie, mais le soin de Servin fut pour elle une
nouvelle preuve de l'existence d'un mystère dont la gravité n'était pas
douteuse; elle avait déjà inventé tout ce qui devait être, et pouvait
dire comme l'abbé Vertot: _Mon siége est fait_. Elle descendit
bruyamment l'escalier et tira violemment la porte qui donnait dans
l'appartement de Servin, afin de faire croire qu'elle sortait; mais elle
remonta doucement, et se tint derrière la porte de l'atelier. Quand le
peintre et Ginevra se crurent seuls, il frappa d'une certaine manière à
la porte de la mansarde, qui tourna aussitôt sur ses gonds rouillés et
criards. L'Italienne vit paraître un jeune homme grand et bien fait dont
l'uniforme impérial lui fit battre le coeur. L'officier avait le bras en
écharpe, et la pâleur de son teint accusait de vives souffrances. En
apercevant une inconnue, il tressaillit. Amélie, qui ne pouvait rien
voir, trembla de rester plus longtemps; mais il lui suffisait d'avoir
entendu le grincement de la porte, elle s'en alla sans bruit.
--Ne craignez rien, dit le peintre à l'officier; mademoiselle est la
fille du plus fidèle ami de l'Empereur, le baron de Piombo.
Le jeune militaire ne conserva plus de doute sur le patriotisme de
Ginevra, après l'avoir vue.
--Vous êtes blessé? dit-elle.
--Oh! ce n'est rien, mademoiselle, la plaie se referme.
En ce moment, les voix criardes et perçantes des colporteurs arrivèrent
jusqu'à l'atelier: «Voici le jugement qui condamne à mort...» Tous trois
tressaillirent. Le soldat entendit, le premier, un nom qui le fit pâlir.
--Labédoyère! dit-il en tombant sur le tabouret.
Ils se regardèrent en silence. Des gouttes de sueur se formèrent sur le
front livide du jeune homme, il saisit d'une main et par un geste de
désespoir les touffes noires de sa chevelure, et appuya son coude sur le
bord du chevalet de Ginevra.
--Après tout, dit-il en se levant brusquement, Labédoyère et moi nous
savions ce que nous faisions. Nous connaissions le sort qui nous
attendait après le triomphe comme après la chute. Il meurt pour sa
cause, et moi je me cache...
Il alla précipitamment vers la porte de l'atelier; mais plus leste que
lui, Ginevra s'était élancée et lui en barrait le chemin.
--Rétablirez-vous l'Empereur? dit-elle. Croyez-vous pouvoir relever ce
géant quand lui-même n'a pas su rester debout?
--Que voulez-vous que je devienne? dit alors le proscrit en s'adressant
aux deux amis que lui avait envoyés le hasard. Je n'ai pas un seul
parent dans le monde, Labédoyère était mon protecteur et mon ami, je
suis seul; demain je serai peut-être proscrit ou condamné, je n'ai
jamais eu que ma paye pour fortune, j'ai mangé mon dernier écu pour
venir arracher Labédoyère à son sort et tâcher de l'emmener; la mort est
donc une nécessité pour moi. Quand on est décidé à mourir, il faut
savoir vendre sa tête au bourreau. Je pensais tout à l'heure que la vie
d'un honnête homme vaut bien celle de deux traîtres, et qu'un coup de
poignard bien placé peut donner l'immortalité.
Cet accès de désespoir effraya le peintre et Ginevra elle-même, qui
comprit bien le jeune homme. L'Italienne admira cette belle tête et
cette voix délicieuse dont la douceur était à peine altérée par des
accents de fureur; puis elle jeta tout à coup du baume sur toutes les
plaies de l'infortuné.
--Monsieur, dit-elle, quant à votre détresse pécuniaire, permettez-moi
de vous offrir l'or de mes économies. Mon père est riche, je suis son
seul enfant, il m'aime, et je suis bien sûre qu'il ne me blâmera pas. Ne
vous faites pas scrupule d'accepter: nos biens viennent de l'Empereur,
nous n'avons pas un centime qui ne soit un effet de sa munificence.
N'est-ce pas être reconnaissants que d'obliger un de ses fidèles
soldats? Prenez donc cette somme avec aussi peu de façons que j'en mets
à vous l'offrir. Ce n'est que de l'argent, ajouta-t-elle d'un ton de
mépris. Maintenant, quant à des amis, vous en trouverez! Là, elle leva
fièrement la tête, et ses yeux brillèrent d'un éclat inusité.--La tête
qui tombera demain devant une douzaine de fusils sauve la vôtre,
reprit-elle. Attendez que cet orage passe, et vous pourrez aller
chercher du service à l'étranger si l'on ne vous oublie pas, ou dans
l'armée française si l'on vous oublie.
Il existe dans les consolations que donne une femme une délicatesse qui
a toujours quelque chose de maternel, de prévoyant, de complet. Mais
quand, à ces paroles de paix et d'espérance, se joignent la grâce des
gestes, cette éloquence de ton qui vient du coeur, et que surtout la
bienfaitrice est belle, il est difficile à un jeune homme de résister.
Le colonel aspira l'amour par tous les sens. Une légère teinte rose
nuança ses joues blanches, ses yeux perdirent un peu de la mélancolie
qui les ternissait, et il dit d'un son de voix particulier:--Vous êtes
un ange de bonté! Mais Labédoyère, ajouta-t-il, Labédoyère!
A ce cri, ils se regardèrent tous les trois en silence, et ils se
comprirent. Ce n'était plus des amis de vingt minutes, mais de vingt
ans.
--Mon cher, reprit Servin, pouvez-vous le sauver?
--Je puis le venger.
Ginevra tressaillit: quoique l'inconnu fût beau, son aspect n'avait
point ému la jeune fille; la douce pitié que les femmes trouvent dans
leur coeur pour les misères qui n'ont rien d'ignoble avait étouffé chez
Ginevra toute autre affection: mais entendre un cri de vengeance,
rencontrer dans ce proscrit une âme italienne, du dévouement pour
Napoléon, de la générosité à la corse?.... c'en était trop pour elle;
elle contempla donc l'officier avec une émotion respectueuse qui lui
agita fortement le coeur. Pour la première fois, un homme lui faisait
éprouver un sentiment si vif. Comme toutes les femmes, elle se plut à
mettre l'âme de l'inconnu en harmonie avec la beauté distinguée de ses
traits, avec les heureuses proportions de sa taille qu'elle admirait en
artiste. Menée par le hasard de la curiosité à la pitié, de la pitié à
un intérêt puissant, elle arrivait de cet intérêt à des sensations si
profondes, qu'elle crut dangereux de rester là plus longtemps.
--A demain, dit-elle en laissant à l'officier le plus doux de ses
sourires pour consolation.
En voyant ce sourire, qui jetait comme un nouveau jour sur la figure de
Ginevra, l'inconnu oublia tout pendant un instant.
--Demain, répondit-il avec tristesse, demain, Labédoyère...
Ginevra se retourna, mit un doigt sur ses lèvres, et le regarda comme si
elle lui disait:--Calmez-vous, soyez prudent.
Alors le jeune homme s'écria:--_O Dio! che non vorrei vivere dopo averla
veduta!_ (O Dieu, qui ne voudrait vivre après l'avoir vue!)
L'accent particulier avec lequel il prononça cette phrase fit
tressaillir Ginevra.
--Vous êtes Corse? s'écria-t-elle en revenant à lui le coeur palpitant
d'aise.
--Je suis né en Corse, répondit-il; mais j'ai été amené très-jeune à
Gênes; et, aussitôt que j'eus atteint l'âge auquel on entre au service
militaire, je me suis engagé.
La beauté de l'inconnu, l'attrait surnaturel que lui prêtaient ses
opinions bonapartistes, sa blessure, son malheur, son danger même, tout
disparut aux yeux de Ginevra, ou plutôt tout se fondit dans un seul
sentiment, nouveau, délicieux. Ce proscrit était un enfant de la Corse,
il en parlait le langage chéri! La jeune fille resta pendant un moment
immobile, retenue par une sensation magique. Elle avait en effet sous
les yeux un tableau vivant auquel tous les sentiments humains réunis et
le hasard donnaient de vives couleurs. Sur l'invitation de Servin,
l'officier s'était assis sur un divan. Le peintre avait dénoué l'écharpe
qui retenait le bras de son hôte, et s'occupait à en défaire l'appareil
afin de panser la blessure. Ginevra frissonna en voyant la longue et
large plaie que la lame d'un sabre avait faite sur l'avant-bras du jeune
homme, et laissa échapper une plainte. L'inconnu leva la tête vers elle
et se mit à sourire. Il y avait quelque chose de touchant et qui allait
à l'âme dans l'attention avec laquelle Servin enlevait la charpie et
tâtait les chairs meurtries; tandis que la figure du blessé, quoique
pâle et maladive, exprimait, à l'aspect de la jeune fille, plus de
plaisir que de souffrance. Une artiste devait admirer involontairement
cette opposition de sentiments, et les contrastes que produisaient la
blancheur des linges, la nudité du bras, avec l'uniforme bleu et rouge
de l'officier. En ce moment, une obscurité douce enveloppait l'atelier;
mais un dernier rayon de soleil vint éclairer la place où se trouvait le
proscrit, en sorte que sa noble et blanche figure, ses cheveux noirs,
ses vêtements, tout fut inondé par le jour. Cet effet si simple, la
superstitieuse Italienne le prit pour un heureux présage. L'inconnu
ressemblait ainsi à un céleste messager qui lui faisait entendre le
langage de la patrie, et la mettait sous le charme des souvenirs de son
enfance, pendant que dans son coeur naissait un sentiment aussi frais,
aussi pur que son premier âge d'innocence. Pendant un moment bien court,
elle demeura songeuse et comme plongée dans une pensée infinie; puis
elle rougit de laisser voir sa préoccupation, échangea un doux et rapide
regard avec le proscrit, et s'enfuit en le voyant toujours.
Le lendemain n'était pas un jour de leçon, Ginevra vint à l'atelier et
le prisonnier put rester auprès de sa compatriote; Servin, qui avait une
esquisse à terminer, permit au reclus d'y demeurer en servant de mentor
aux deux jeunes gens, qui s'entretinrent souvent en corse. Le pauvre
soldat raconta ses souffrances pendant la déroute de Moscou, car il
s'était trouvé, à l'âge de dix-neuf ans, au passage de la Bérézina, seul
de son régiment après avoir perdu dans ses camarades les seuls hommes
qui pussent s'intéresser à un orphelin. Il peignit en traits de feu le
grand désastre de Waterloo. Sa voix fut une musique pour l'Italienne.
Élevée à la corse, Ginevra était en quelque sorte la fille de la nature,
elle ignorait le mensonge et se livrait sans détour à ses impressions,
elle les avouait, ou plutôt les laissait deviner sans le manége de la
petite et calculatrice coquetterie des jeunes filles de Paris.
Pendant cette journée, elle resta plus d'une fois, sa palette d'une
main, son pinceau de l'autre, sans que le pinceau s'abreuvât des
couleurs de la palette: les yeux attachés sur l'officier et la bouche
légèrement entr'ouverte, elle écoutait, se tenant toujours prête à
donner un coup de pinceau qu'elle ne donnait jamais. Elle ne s'étonnait
pas de trouver tant de douceur dans les yeux du jeune homme, car elle
sentait les siens devenir doux malgré sa volonté de les tenir sévères ou
calmes. Puis, elle peignait ensuite avec une attention particulière et
pendant des heures entières, sans lever la tête, parce qu'il était là,
près d'elle, la regardant travailler. La première fois qu'il vint
s'asseoir pour la contempler en silence, elle lui dit d'un son de voix
ému, et après une longue pause:--Cela vous amuse donc, de voir peindre?
Ce jour-là, elle apprit qu'il se nommait Luigi. Avant de se séparer, ils
convinrent que, les jours d'atelier, s'il arrivait quelque événement
politique important, Ginevra l'en instruirait en chantant à voix basse
certains airs italiens.
Le lendemain, mademoiselle Thirion apprit sous le secret à toutes ses
compagnes que Ginevra di Piombo était aimée d'un jeune homme qui venait,
pendant les heures consacrées aux leçons, s'établir dans le cabinet noir
de l'atelier.
--Vous qui prenez son parti, dit-elle à mademoiselle Roguin, examinez-la
bien, et vous verrez à quoi elle passera son temps.
Ginevra fut donc observée avec une attention diabolique. On écouta ses
chansons, on épia ses regards. Au moment où elle ne croyait être vue de
personne, une douzaine d'yeux étaient incessamment arrêtés sur elle.
Ainsi prévenues, ces jeunes filles interprétèrent dans leur sens vrai
les agitations qui passèrent sur la brillante figure de l'Italienne, et
ses gestes, et l'accent particulier de ses fredonnements, et l'air
attentif avec lequel elle écoutait des sons indistincts qu'elle seule
entendait à travers la cloison. Au bout d'une huitaine de jours, une
seule des quinze élèves de Servin s'était refusée à voir Louis par la
crevasse de la cloison. Cette jeune fille était Laure, la jolie personne
pauvre et assidue qui, par un instinct de faiblesse, aimait
véritablement la belle Corse et la défendait encore. Mademoiselle Roguin
voulut faire rester Laure sur l'escalier à l'heure du départ, afin de
lui prouver l'intimité de Ginevra et du beau jeune homme en les
surprenant ensemble. Laure refusa de descendre à un espionnage que la
curiosité ne justifiait pas, et devint l'objet d'une réprobation
universelle.
Bientôt la fille de l'huissier du cabinet du roi trouva qu'il n'était
pas convenable pour elle de venir à l'atelier d'un peintre dont les
opinions avaient une teinte de patriotisme ou de bonapartisme, ce qui, à
cette époque, semblait une seule et même chose; elle ne revint donc plus
chez Servin, qui refusa poliment d'aller chez elle. Si Amélie oublia
Ginevra, le mal qu'elle avait semé porta ses fruits. Insensiblement, par
hasard, par caquetage ou par pruderie, toutes les autres jeunes
personnes instruisirent leurs mères de l'étrange aventure qui se passait
à l'atelier. Un jour Mathilde Roguin ne vint pas, la leçon suivante ce
fut une autre jeune fille; enfin trois ou quatre demoiselles, qui
étaient restées les dernières, ne revinrent plus. Ginevra et
mademoiselle Laure, sa petite amie, furent pendant deux ou trois jours
les seules habitantes de l'atelier désert. L'Italienne ne s'apercevait
point de l'abandon dans lequel elle se trouvait, et ne recherchait même
pas la cause de l'absence de ses compagnes. Ayant inventé depuis peu les
moyens de correspondre mystérieusement avec Louis, elle vivait à
l'atelier comme dans une délicieuse retraite, seule au milieu d'un
monde, ne pensant qu'à l'officier et aux dangers qui le menaçaient.
Cette jeune fille, quoique sincèrement admiratrice des nobles caractères
qui ne veulent pas trahir leur foi politique, pressait Louis de se
soumettre promptement à l'autorité royale, afin de le garder en France.
Louis ne voulait pas sortir de sa cachette. Si les passions ne naissent
et ne grandissent que sous l'influence d'événements extraordinaires et
romanesques, on peut dire que jamais tant de circonstances ne
concoururent à lier deux êtres par un même sentiment. L'amitié de
Ginevra pour Louis et de Louis pour elle fit plus de progrès en un mois
qu'une amitié du monde n'en fait en dix ans dans un salon. L'adversité
n'est-elle pas la pierre de touche des caractères? Ginevra put donc
apprécier facilement Louis, le connaître, et ils ressentirent bientôt
une estime réciproque l'un pour l'autre. Plus âgée que Louis, Ginevra
trouvait une douceur extrême à être courtisée par un jeune homme déjà si
grand, si éprouvé par le sort, et qui joignait à l'expérience d'un homme
toutes les grâces de l'adolescence. De son côté, Louis ressentait un
indicible plaisir à se laisser protéger en apparence par une jeune fille
de vingt-cinq ans. Il y avait dans ce sentiment un certain orgueil
inexplicable. Peut-être était-ce une preuve d'amour. L'union de la
douceur et de la fierté, de la force et de la faiblesse avait en Ginevra
d'irrésistibles attraits, et Louis était entièrement subjugué par elle.
Ils s'aimaient si profondément déjà, qu'ils n'avaient eu besoin ni de se
le nier, ni de se le dire.
Un jour, vers le soir, Ginevra entendit le signal convenu, Louis
frappait avec une épingle sur la boiserie de manière à ne pas produire
plus de bruit qu'une araignée qui attache son fil, et demandait ainsi à
sortir de sa retraite. L'Italienne jeta un coup d'oeil dans l'atelier,
ne vit pas la petite Laure, et répondit au signal. Louis ouvrit la
porte, aperçut l'écolière, et rentra précipitamment. Étonnée, Ginevra
regarde autour d'elle, trouve Laure, et lui dit en allant à son
chevalet:--Vous restez bien tard, ma chère. Cette tête me paraît
pourtant achevée, il n'y a plus qu'un reflet à indiquer sur le haut de
cette tresse de cheveux.
--Vous seriez bien bonne, dit Laure d'une voix émue, si vous vouliez me
corriger cette copie, je pourrais conserver quelque chose de vous....
--Je veux bien, répondit Ginevra sûre de pouvoir ainsi la congédier. Je
croyais, reprit-elle en donnant de légers coups de pinceau, que vous
aviez beaucoup de chemin à faire de chez vous à l'atelier.
--Oh! Ginevra, je vais m'en aller et pour toujours, s'écria la jeune
fille d'un air triste.
L'Italienne ne fut pas autant affectée de ces paroles pleines de
mélancolie qu'elle l'aurait été un mois auparavant.
--Vous quittez monsieur Servin? demanda-t-elle.
--Vous ne vous apercevez donc pas, Ginevra, que depuis quelque temps il
n'y a plus ici que vous et moi?
--C'est vrai, répondit Ginevra frappée tout à coup comme par un
souvenir. Ces demoiselles seraient-elles malades, se marieraient-elles,
ou leurs pères seraient-ils tous de service au château?
--Toutes ont quitté monsieur Servin, répondit Laure.
--Et pourquoi?
--A cause de vous, Ginevra.
--De moi! répéta la fille corse en se levant, le front menaçant, l'oeil
fier et les yeux étincelants.
--Oh! ne vous fâchez pas, ma bonne Ginevra, s'écria douloureusement
Laure. Mais ma mère aussi veut que je quitte l'atelier. Toutes ces
demoiselles ont dit que vous aviez une intrigue, que monsieur Servin se
prêtait à ce qu'un jeune homme qui vous aime demeurât dans le cabinet
noir; je n'ai jamais cru ces calomnies et n'en ai rien dit à ma mère.
Hier au soir, madame Roguin a rencontré ma mère dans un bal et lui a
demandé si elle m'envoyait toujours ici. Sur la réponse affirmative de
ma mère, elle lui a répété les mensonges de ces demoiselles. Maman m'a
bien grondée, elle a prétendu que je devais savoir tout cela, que
j'avais manqué à la confiance qui règne entre une mère et sa fille en ne
lui en parlant pas. O ma chère Ginevra! moi qui vous prenais pour
modèle, combien je suis fâchée de ne plus pouvoir rester votre
compagne...
--Nous nous retrouverons dans la vie: les jeunes filles se marient...
dit Ginevra.
--Quand elles sont riches, répondit Laure.
--Viens me voir, mon père a de la fortune...
--Ginevra, reprit Laure attendrie, madame Roguin et ma mère doivent
venir demain chez monsieur Servin pour lui faire des reproches, au moins
qu'il en soit prévenu.
La foudre tombée à deux pas de Ginevra l'aurait moins étonnée que cette
révélation.
--Qu'est-ce que cela leur faisait? dit-elle naïvement.
--Tout le monde trouve cela fort mal. Maman dit que c'est contraire aux
moeurs...
--Et vous, Laure, qu'en pensez-vous?
La jeune fille regarda Ginevra, leurs pensées se confondirent. Laure ne
retint plus ses larmes, se jeta au cou de son amie et l'embrassa. En ce
moment, Servin arriva.
--Mademoiselle Ginevra, dit-il avec enthousiasme, j'ai fini mon tableau,
on le vernit. Qu'avez-vous donc? Il paraît que toutes ces demoiselles
prennent des vacances, ou sont à la campagne.
Laure sécha ses larmes, salua Servin, et se retira.
--L'atelier est désert depuis plusieurs jours, dit Ginevra, et ces
demoiselles ne reviendront plus.
--Bah?...
--Oh! ne riez pas, reprit Ginevra, écoutez-moi: je suis la cause
involontaire de la perte de votre réputation.
L'artiste se mit à sourire, et dit en interrompant son écolière:--Ma
réputation?... mais, dans quelques jours, mon tableau sera exposé.
--Il ne s'agit pas de votre talent, dit l'Italienne; mais de votre
moralité. Ces demoiselles ont publié que Louis était renfermé ici, que
vous vous prêtiez... à... notre amour...
--Il y a du vrai là-dedans, mademoiselle, répondit le professeur. Les
mères de ces demoiselles sont des bégueules, reprit-il. Si elles étaient
venues me trouver, tout se serait expliqué. Mais que je prenne du souci
de tout cela? la vie est trop courte!
Et le peintre fit craquer ses doigts par-dessus sa tête. Louis, qui
avait entendu une partie de cette conversation, accourut aussitôt.
--Vous allez perdre toutes vos écolières, s'écria-t-il, et je vous aurai
ruiné.
L'artiste prit la main de Louis et celle de Ginevra, les joignit.--Vous
vous marierez, mes enfants? leur demanda-t-il avec une touchante
bonhomie. Ils baissèrent tous deux les yeux, et leur silence fut le
premier aveu qu'ils se firent.--Eh bien! reprit Servin, vous serez
heureux, n'est-ce pas? Y a-t-il quelque chose qui puisse payer le
bonheur de deux êtres tels que vous!
--Je suis riche, dit Ginevra, et vous me permettrez de vous
indemniser...
--Indemniser!... s'écria Servin. Quand on saura que j'ai été victime des
calomnies de quelques sottes, et que je cachais un proscrit; mais tous
les libéraux de Paris m'enverront leurs filles! Je serai peut-être alors
votre débiteur...
Louis serrait la main de son protecteur sans pouvoir prononcer une
parole; mais enfin il lui dit d'une voix attendrie:--C'est donc à vous
que je devrai toute ma félicité.
--Soyez heureux, je vous unis! dit le peintre avec une onction comique
et en imposant les mains sur la tête des deux amants.
Cette plaisanterie d'artiste mit fin à leur attendrissement. Ils se
regardèrent tous trois en riant. L'Italienne serra la main de Louis par
une violente étreinte et avec une simplicité d'action digne des moeurs
de sa patrie.
--Ah çà, mes chers enfants, reprit Servin, vous croyez que tout ça va
maintenant à merveille? Eh bien, vous vous trompez.
Les deux amants l'examinèrent avec étonnement.
--Rassurez-vous, je suis le seul que votre espièglerie embarrasse!
Madame Servin est un peu _collet-monté_, et je ne sais en vérité pas
comment nous nous arrangerons avec elle.
--Dieu! j'oubliais! s'écria Ginevra. Demain, madame Roguin et la mère de
Laure doivent venir vous...
--J'entends! dit le peintre en interrompant.
--Mais vous pouvez vous justifier, reprit la jeune fille en laissant
échapper un geste de tête plein d'orgueil. Monsieur Louis, dit-elle en
se tournant vers lui et le regardant avec finesse, ne doit plus avoir
d'antipathie pour le gouvernement royal?--Eh bien, reprit-elle après
l'avoir vu souriant, demain matin j'enverrai une pétition à l'un des
personnages les plus influents du ministère de la guerre, à un homme qui
ne peut rien refuser à la fille du baron de Piombo. Nous obtiendrons un
pardon tacite pour le commandant Louis, car _ils_ ne voudront pas vous
reconnaître le grade de colonel. Et vous pourrez, ajouta-t-elle en
s'adressant à Servin, confondre les mères de mes charitables compagnes
en leur disant la vérité.
--Vous êtes un ange! s'écria Servin.
Pendant que cette scène se passait à l'atelier, le père et la mère de
Ginevra s'impatientaient de ne pas la voir revenir.
--Il est six heures, et Ginevra n'est pas encore de retour s'écria
Bartholoméo.
--Elle n'est jamais rentrée si tard, répondit la femme de Piombo.
Les deux vieillards se regardèrent avec toutes les marques d'une anxiété
peu ordinaire. Trop agité pour rester en place, Bartholoméo se leva et
fit deux fois le tour de son salon assez lestement pour un homme de
soixante-dix-sept ans. Grâce à sa constitution robuste il avait subi peu
de changements depuis le jour de son arrivée à Paris, et malgré sa haute
taille, il se tenait encore droit. Ses cheveux devenus blancs et rares
laissaient à découvert un crâne large et protubérant qui donnait une
haute idée de son caractère et de sa fermeté. Sa figure marquée de
rides profondes avait pris un très-grand développement et gardait ce
teint pâle qui inspire la vénération. La fougue des passions régnait
encore dans le feu surnaturel de ses yeux dont les sourcils n'avaient
pas entièrement blanchi, et qui conservaient leur terrible mobilité.
L'aspect de cette tête était sévère, mais on voyait que Bartholoméo
avait le droit d'être ainsi. Sa bonté, sa douceur n'étaient guère
connues que de sa femme et de sa fille. Dans ses fonctions ou devant un
étranger, il ne déposait jamais la majesté que le temps imprimait à sa
personne, et l'habitude de froncer ses gros sourcils, de contracter les
rides de son visage, de donner à son regard une fixité napoléonienne,
rendait son abord glacial. Pendant le cours de sa vie politique, il
avait été si généralement craint, qu'il passait pour peu sociable; mais
il n'est pas difficile d'expliquer les causes de cette réputation. La
vie, les moeurs et la fidélité de Piombo faisaient la censure de la
plupart des courtisans. Malgré les missions délicates confiées à sa
discrétion, et qui pour tout autre eussent été lucratives, il ne
possédait pas plus d'une trentaine de mille livres de rente en
inscriptions sur le grand-livre. Si l'on vient à songer au bon marché
des rentes sous l'empire, à la libéralité de Napoléon envers ceux de ses
fidèles serviteurs qui savaient parler, il est facile de voir que le
baron de Piombo était un homme d'une probité sévère; il ne devait son
plumage de baron qu'à la nécessité dans laquelle Napoléon s'était trouvé
de lui donner un titre en l'envoyant dans une cour étrangère.
Bartholoméo avait toujours professé une haine implacable pour les
traîtres dont s'entoura Napoléon en croyant les conquérir à force de
victoires. Ce fut lui qui, dit-on, fit trois pas vers la porte du
cabinet de l'empereur, après lui avoir donné le conseil de se
débarrasser de trois hommes en France, la veille du jour où il partit
pour sa célèbre et admirable campagne de 1814. Depuis le second retour
des Bourbons, Bartholoméo ne portait plus la décoration de la
Légion-d'Honneur. Jamais homme n'offrit une plus belle image de ces
vieux républicains, amis incorruptibles de l'Empire, qui restaient comme
les vivants débris des deux gouvernements les plus énergiques que le
monde ait connus. Si le baron de Piombo déplaisait à quelques
courtisans, il avait les Daru, les Drouot, les Carnot pour amis. Aussi,
quant au reste des hommes politiques, depuis Waterloo, s'en souciait-il
autant que des bouffées de fumée qu'il tirait de son cigare.
Bartholoméo di Piombo avait acquis, moyennant la somme assez modique que
_Madame_, mère de l'empereur, lui avait donnée de ses propriétés en
Corse, l'ancien hôtel de Portenduère, dans lequel il ne fit aucun
changement. Presque toujours logé aux frais du gouvernement, il
n'habitait cette maison que depuis la catastrophe de Fontainebleau.
Suivant l'habitude des gens simples et de haute vertu, le baron et sa
femme ne donnaient rien au faste extérieur: leurs meubles provenaient de
l'ancien ameublement de l'hôtel. Les grands appartements hauts d'étage,
sombres et nus de cette demeure, les larges glaces encadrées dans de
vieilles bordures dorées presque noires, et ce mobilier du temps de
Louis XIV, étaient en rapport avec Bartholoméo et sa femme, personnages
dignes de l'antiquité. Sous l'Empire et pendant les Cent-Jours, en
exerçant des fonctions largement rétribuées, le vieux Corse avait eu un
grand train de maison, plutôt dans le but de faire honneur à sa place
que dans le dessein de briller. Sa vie et celle de sa femme étaient si
frugales, si tranquilles, que leur modeste fortune suffisait à leurs
besoins. Pour eux, leur fille Ginevra valait toutes les richesses du
monde. Aussi, quand, en mai 1814, le baron de Piombo quitta sa place,
congédia ses gens et ferma la porte de son écurie, Ginevra, simple et
sans faste comme ses parents, n'eut-elle aucun regret: à l'exemple des
grandes âmes, elle mettait son luxe dans la force des sentiments, comme
elle plaçait sa félicité dans la solitude et le travail. Puis, ces trois
êtres s'aimaient trop pour que les dehors de l'existence eussent quelque
prix à leurs yeux. Souvent, et surtout depuis la seconde et effroyable
chute de Napoléon, Bartholoméo et sa femme passaient des soirées
délicieuses à entendre Ginevra toucher du piano ou chanter. Il y avait
pour eux un immense secret de plaisir dans la présence, dans la moindre
parole de leur fille, ils la suivaient des yeux avec une tendre
inquiétude, ils entendaient son pas dans la cour, quelque léger qu'il
pût être. Semblable à des amants, ils savaient rester des heures
entières silencieux tous trois, entendant mieux ainsi que par des
paroles l'éloquence de leurs âmes. Ce sentiment profond, la vie même des
deux vieillards, animait toutes leurs pensées. Ce n'était pas trois
existences, mais une seule, qui, semblable à la flamme d'un foyer, se
divisait en trois langues de feu. Si quelquefois le souvenir des
bienfaits et du malheur de Napoléon, si la politique du moment
triomphaient de la constante sollicitude des deux vieillards, ils
pouvaient en parler sans rompre la communauté de leurs pensées: Ginevra
ne partageait-elle pas leurs passions politiques? Quoi de plus naturel
que l'ardeur avec laquelle ils se réfugiaient dans le coeur de leur
unique enfant? Jusqu'alors, les occupations d'une vie publique avaient
absorbé l'énergie du baron de Piombo; mais en quittant ses emplois, le
Corse eut besoin de rejeter son énergie dans le dernier sentiment qui
lui restât; puis, à part les liens qui unissent un père et une mère à
leur fille, il y avait peut-être, à l'insu de ces trois âmes
despotiques, une puissante raison au fanatisme de leur passion
réciproque: ils s'aimaient sans partage, le coeur tout entier de Ginevra
appartenait à son père, comme à elle celui de Piombo; enfin, s'il est
vrai que nous nous attachions les uns aux autres plus par nos défauts
que par nos qualités, Ginevra répondait merveilleusement bien à toutes
les passions de son père. De là procédait la seule imperfection de cette
triple vie. Ginevra était entière dans ses volontés, vindicative,
emportée comme Bartholoméo l'avait été pendant sa jeunesse. Le Corse se
complut à développer ces sentiments sauvages dans le coeur de sa fille,
absolument comme un lion apprend à ses lionceaux à fondre sur leur
proie. Mais cet apprentissage de vengeance ne pouvant en quelque sorte
se faire qu'au logis paternel, Ginevra ne pardonnait rien à son père, et
il fallait qu'il lui cédât. Piombo ne voyait que des enfantillages dans
ces querelles factices; mais l'enfant y contracta l'habitude de dominer
ses parents. Au milieu de ces tempêtes que Bartholoméo aimait à exciter,
un mot de tendresse, un regard suffisaient pour apaiser leurs âmes
courroucées, et ils n'étaient jamais si près d'un baiser que quand ils
se menaçaient. Cependant, depuis cinq années environ, Ginevra, devenue
plus sage que son père, évitait constamment ces sortes de scènes. Sa
fidélité, son dévouement, l'amour qui triomphait dans toutes ses pensées
et son admirable bon sens avaient fait justice de ses colères; mais il
n'en était pas moins résulté un bien grand mal: Ginevra vivait avec son
père et sa mère sur le pied d'une égalité toujours funeste. Pour achever
de faire connaître tous les changements survenus chez ces trois
personnages depuis leur arrivée à Paris, Piombo et sa femme, gens sans
instruction, avaient laissé Ginevra étudier à sa fantaisie. Au gré de
ses caprices de jeune fille, elle avait tout appris et tout quitté,
reprenant et laissant chaque pensée tour à tour, jusqu'à ce que la
peinture fût devenue sa passion dominante; elle eût été parfaite, si sa
mère avait été capable de diriger ses études, de l'éclairer et de mettre
en harmonie les dons de la nature: ses défauts provenaient de la funeste
éducation que le vieux Corse avait pris plaisir à lui donner.
Après avoir pendant long-temps fait crier sous ses pas les feuilles du
parquet, le vieillard sonna. Un domestique parut.
--Allez au-devant de mademoiselle Ginevra, dit-il.
--J'ai toujours regretté de ne plus avoir de voiture pour elle, observa
la baronne.
--Elle n'en a pas voulu, répondit Piombo en regardant sa femme qui,
accoutumée depuis quarante ans à son rôle d'obéissance, baissa les yeux.
Déjà septuagénaire, grande, sèche, pâle et ridée, la baronne ressemblait
parfaitement à ces vieilles femmes que Schnetz met dans les scènes
italiennes de ses tableaux de genre; elle restait si habituellement
silencieuse, qu'on l'eût prise pour une nouvelle madame Shandy; mais un
mot, un regard, un geste annonçaient que ses sentiments avaient gardé la
vigueur et la fraîcheur de la jeunesse. Sa toilette, dépouillée de
coquetterie, manquait souvent de goût. Elle demeurait ordinairement
passive, plongée dans une bergère, comme une sultane _Validé_, attendant
ou admirant sa Ginevra, son orgueil et sa vie. La beauté, la toilette,
la grâce de sa fille, semblaient être devenues siennes. Tout pour elle
était bien quand Ginevra se trouvait heureuse. Ses cheveux avaient
blanchi, et quelques mèches se voyaient au-dessus de son front blanc et
ridé, ou le long de ses joues creuses.
--Voilà quinze jours environ, dit-elle, que Ginevra rentre un peu plus
tard.
--Jean n'ira pas assez vite, s'écria l'impatient vieillard qui croisa
les basques de son habit bleu, saisit son chapeau, l'enfonça sur sa
tête, prit sa canne et partit.
--Tu n'iras pas loin, lui cria sa femme.
En effet, la porte cochère s'était ouverte et fermée, et la vieille mère
entendait le pas de Ginevra dans la cour. Bartholoméo reparut tout à
coup portant en triomphe sa fille, qui se débattait dans ses bras.
--La voici, la Ginevra, la Ginevrettina, la Ginevrina, la Ginevrola, la
Ginevretta, la Ginevra bella!
--Mon père, vous me faites mal.
Aussitôt Ginevra fut posée à terre avec une sorte de respect. Elle
agita la tête par un gracieux mouvement pour rassurer sa mère qui déjà
s'effrayait, et pour lui dire que c'était une ruse. Le visage terne et
pâle de la baronne reprit alors ses couleurs et une espèce de gaieté.
Piombo se frotta les mains avec une force extrême, symptôme le plus
certain de sa joie; il avait pris cette habitude à la cour en voyant
Napoléon se mettre en colère contre ceux de ses généraux ou de ses
ministres qui le servaient mal ou qui avaient commis quelque faute. Les
muscles de sa figure une fois détendus, la moindre ride de son front
exprimait la bienveillance. Ces deux vieillards offraient en ce moment
une image exacte de ces plantes souffrantes auxquelles un peu d'eau rend
la vie après une longue sécheresse.
--A table, à table! s'écria le baron en présentant sa large main à
Ginevra qu'il nomma Signora Piombellina, autre symptôme de gaieté auquel
sa fille répondit par un sourire.
--Ah çà, dit Piombo en sortant de table, sais-tu que ta mère m'a fait
observer que depuis un mois tu restes beaucoup plus long-temps que de
coutume à ton atelier? Il paraît que la peinture passe avant nous.
--O mon père!
--Ginevra nous prépare sans doute quelque surprise, dit la mère.
--Tu m'apporterais un tableau de toi?... s'écria le Corse en frappant
dans ses mains.
--Oui, je suis très-occupée à l'atelier, répondit-elle.
--Qu'as-tu donc, Ginevra? Tu pâlis! lui dit sa mère.
--Non! s'écria la jeune fille en laissant échapper un geste de
résolution, non, il ne sera pas dit que Ginevra Piombo aura menti une
fois dans sa vie.
En entendant cette singulière exclamation, Piombo et sa femme
regardèrent leur fille d'un air étonné.
--J'aime un jeune homme, ajouta-t-elle d'une voix émue.
Puis, sans oser regarder ses parents, elle abaissa ses larges paupières,
comme pour voiler le feu de ses yeux.
--Est-ce un prince? lui demanda ironiquement son père en prenant un son
de voix qui fit trembler la mère et la fille.
--Non, mon père, répondit-elle avec modestie, c'est un jeune homme sans
fortune....
--Il est donc bien beau?
--Il est malheureux.
--Que fait-il?
--Compagnon de Labédoyère; il était proscrit, sans asile, Servin l'a
caché, et...
--Servin est un honnête garçon qui s'est bien comporté, s'écria Piombo;
mais vous faites mal, vous, ma fille, d'aimer un autre homme que votre
père...
--Il ne dépend pas de moi de ne pas aimer, répondit doucement Ginevra.
--Je me flattais, reprit son père, que ma Ginevra me serait fidèle
jusqu'à ma mort, que mes soins et ceux de sa mère seraient les seuls
qu'elle aurait reçus, que notre tendresse n'aurait pas rencontré dans
son âme de tendresse rivale, et que...
--Vous ai-je reproché votre fanatisme pour Napoléon? dit Ginevra.
N'avez-vous aimé que moi? n'avez-vous pas été des mois entiers en
ambassade? n'ai-je pas supporté courageusement vos absences? La vie a
des nécessités qu'il faut savoir subir.
--Ginevra!
--Non, vous ne m'aimez pas pour moi, et vos reproches trahissent un
insupportable égoïsme.
--Tu accuses l'amour de ton père, s'écria Piombo les yeux flamboyants.
--Mon père, je ne vous accuserai jamais, répondit Ginevra avec plus de
douceur que sa mère tremblante n'en attendait. Vous avez raison dans
votre égoïsme, comme j'ai raison dans mon amour. Le ciel m'est témoin
que jamais fille n'a mieux rempli ses devoirs auprès de ses parents. Je
n'ai jamais eu que bonheur et amour là où d'autres voient souvent des
obligations. Voici quinze ans que je ne me suis pas écartée de dessous
votre aile protectrice, et ce fut un bien doux plaisir pour moi que de
charmer vos jours. Mais serais-je donc ingrate en me livrant au charme
d'aimer, en désirant un époux qui me protège après vous?
--Ah! tu comptes avec ton père, Ginevra, reprit le vieillard d'un ton
sinistre.
Il se fit une pause effrayante pendant laquelle personne n'osa parler.
Enfin, Bartholoméo rompit le silence en s'écriant d'une voix
déchirante:--Oh! reste avec nous, reste auprès de ton vieux père! Je ne
saurais te voir aimant un homme. Ginevra, tu n'attendras pas longtemps
ta liberté...
--Mais, mon père, songez donc que nous ne vous quitterons pas, que nous
serons deux à vous aimer, que vous connaîtrez l'homme aux soins duquel
vous me laisserez! Vous serez doublement chéri par moi et par lui: par
lui qui est encore moi, et par moi qui suis tout lui-même.
--O Ginevra! Ginevra! s'écria le Corse en serrant les poings, pourquoi
ne t'es-tu pas mariée quand Napoléon m'avait accoutumé à cette idée, et
qu'il te présentait des ducs et des comtes?
--Ils m'aimaient par ordre, dit la jeune fille. D'ailleurs, je ne
voulais pas vous quitter, et ils m'auraient emmenée avec eux.
--Tu ne veux pas nous laisser seuls, dit Piombo; mais te marier, c'est
nous isoler! Je te connais, ma fille, tu ne nous aimeras plus.
--Élisa, ajouta-t-il en regardant sa femme qui restait immobile et comme
stupide, nous n'avons plus de fille, elle veut se marier.
Le vieillard s'assit après avoir levé les mains en l'air comme pour
invoquer Dieu; puis il resta courbé comme accablé sous sa peine. Ginevra
vit l'agitation de son père, et la modération de sa colère lui brisa le
coeur; elle s'attendait à une crise, à des fureurs, elle n'avait pas
armé son âme contre la douceur paternelle.
--Mon père, dit-elle d'une voix touchante, non, vous ne serez jamais
abandonné par votre Ginevra. Mais aimez-la aussi un peu pour elle. Si
vous saviez comme _il_ m'aime! Ah! ce ne serait pas lui qui me ferait de
la peine!
--Déjà des comparaisons, s'écria Piombo avec un accent terrible. Non, je
ne puis supporter cette idée, reprit-il. S'il t'aimait comme tu mérites
de l'être, il me tuerait; et s'il ne t'aimait pas, je le poignarderais.
Les mains de Piombo tremblaient, ses lèvres tremblaient, son corps
tremblait et ses yeux lançaient des éclairs; Ginevra seule pouvait
soutenir son regard, car alors elle allumait ses yeux, et la fille était
digne du père.
--Oh! t'aimer! Quel est l'homme digne de cette vie? reprit-il. T'aimer
comme un père, n'est-ce pas déjà vivre dans le paradis; qui donc sera
digne d'être ton époux?
--Lui, dit Ginevra, lui de qui je me sens indigne.
--Lui? répéta machinalement Piombo. Qui, _lui_?
--Celui que j'aime.
--Est-ce qu'il peut te connaître encore assez pour t'adorer?
--Mais, mon père, reprit Ginevra éprouvant un mouvement d'impatience,
quand il ne m'aimerait pas, du moment où je l'aime....
--Tu l'aimes donc? s'écria Piombo. Ginevra inclina doucement la
tête.--Tu l'aimes alors plus que nous?
--Ces deux sentiments ne peuvent se comparer, répondit-elle.
--L'un est plus fort que l'autre, reprit Piombo.
--Je crois que oui, dit Ginevra.
--Tu ne l'épouseras pas, cria le Corse dont la voix fit résonner les
vitres du salon.
--Je l'épouserai, répliqua tranquillement Ginevra.
--Mon Dieu! mon Dieu! s'écria la mère, comment finira cette querelle?
_Santa Virgina!_ mettez-vous entre eux.
Le baron, qui se promenait à grands pas, vint s'asseoir; une sévérité
glacée rembrunissait son visage, il regarda fixement sa fille, et lui
dit d'une voix douce et affaiblie:--Eh bien! Ginevra! non, tu ne
l'épouseras pas. Oh! ne me dis pas oui ce soir?... laisse-moi croire le
contraire. Veux-tu voir ton père à genoux et ses cheveux blancs
prosternés devant toi? je vais te supplier...
--Ginevra Piombo n'a pas été habituée à promettre et à ne pas tenir,
répondit-elle. Je suis votre fille.
--Elle a raison, dit la baronne, nous sommes mises au monde pour nous
marier.
--Ainsi, vous l'encouragez dans sa désobéissance, dit le baron à sa
femme qui, frappée de ce mot, se changea en statue.
--Ce n'est pas désobéir que de se refuser à un ordre injuste, répondit
Ginevra.
--Il ne peut pas être injuste quand il émane de la bouche de votre père,
ma fille! Pourquoi me jugez-vous? La répugnance que j'éprouve n'est-elle
pas un conseil d'en haut? Je vous préserve peut-être d'un malheur.
--Le malheur serait qu'il ne m'aimât pas.
--Toujours lui!
--Oui, toujours, reprit-elle. Il est ma vie, mon bien, ma pensée. Même
en vous obéissant, il serait toujours dans mon coeur. Me défendre de
l'épouser, n'est-ce pas vous haïr?
--Tu ne nous aimes plus, s'écria Piombo.
--Oh! dit Ginevra en agitant la tête.
--Eh bien! oublie-le, reste-nous fidèle. Après nous... tu comprends.
--Mon père, voulez-vous me faire désirer votre mort? s'écria Ginevra.
--Je vivrai plus long-temps que toi! Les enfants qui n'honorent pas
leurs parents meurent promptement, s'écria son père parvenu au dernier
degré de l'exaspération.
--Raison de plus pour me marier promptement et être heureuse! dit-elle.
Ce sang-froid, cette puissance de raisonnement achevèrent de troubler
Piombo, le sang lui porta violemment à la tête, son visage devint
pourpre. Ginevra frissonna, elle s'élança comme un oiseau sur les genoux
de son père, lui passa ses bras autour du cou, lui caressa les cheveux,
et s'écria tout attendrie:--Oh! oui, que je meure la première! Je ne te
survivrais pas, mon père, mon bon père!
--O ma Ginevra, ma folle, ma Ginevrina, répondit Piombo dont toute la
colère se fondit à cette caresse comme une glace sous les rayons du
soleil.
--Il était temps que vous finissiez, dit la baronne d'une voix émue.
--Pauvre mère!
--Ah! Ginevretta! ma Ginevra bella!
Et le père jouait avec sa fille comme avec un enfant de six ans, il
s'amusait à défaire les tresses ondoyantes de ses cheveux, à la faire
sauter; il y avait de la folie dans l'expression de sa tendresse.
Bientôt sa fille le gronda en l'embrassant, et tenta d'obtenir en
plaisantant l'entrée de son Louis au logis. Mais, tout en plaisantant
aussi, le père refusait. Elle bouda, revint, bouda encore; puis, à la
fin de la soirée, elle se trouva contente d'avoir gravé dans le coeur de
son père et son amour pour Louis et l'idée d'un mariage prochain. Le
lendemain elle ne parla plus de son amour, elle alla plus tard à
l'atelier, elle en revint de bonne heure; elle devint plus caressante
pour son père qu'elle ne l'avait jamais été, et se montra pleine de
reconnaissance, comme pour le remercier du consentement qu'il semblait
donner à son mariage par son silence. Le soir elle faisait long-temps de
la musique, et souvent elle s'écriait:--Il faudrait une voix d'homme
pour ce nocturne! Elle était Italienne, c'est tout dire. Au bout de huit
jours sa mère lui fit un signe, elle vint; puis à l'oreille et à voix
basse:--J'ai amené ton père à le recevoir, lui dit-elle.
--O ma mère! vous me faites bien heureuse!
Ce jour-là Ginevra eut donc le bonheur de revenir à l'hôtel de son père
en donnant le bras à Louis. Pour la seconde fois, le pauvre officier
sortait de sa cachette. Les actives sollicitations que Ginevra faisait
auprès du duc de Feltre, alors ministre de la guerre, avaient été
couronnées d'un plein succès. Louis venait d'être réintégré sur le
contrôle des officiers en disponibilité. C'était un bien grand pas vers
un meilleur avenir. Instruit par son amie de toutes les difficultés qui
l'attendaient auprès du baron, le jeune chef de bataillon n'osait avouer
la crainte qu'il avait de ne pas lui plaire. Cet homme si courageux
contre l'adversité, si brave sur un champ de bataille, tremblait en
pensant à son entrée dans le salon des Piombo. Ginevra le sentit
tressaillant, et cette émotion, dont le principe était leur bonheur, fut
pour elle une nouvelle preuve d'amour.
--Comme vous êtes pâle! lui dit-elle quand ils arrivèrent à la porte de
l'hôtel.
--O Ginevra! s'il ne s'agissait que de ma vie.
Quoique Bartholoméo fût prévenu par sa femme de la présentation
officielle de celui que Ginevra aimait, il n'alla pas à sa rencontre,
resta dans le fauteuil où il avait l'habitude d'être assis, et la
sévérité de son front fut glaciale.
--Mon père, dit Ginevra, je vous amène une personne que vous aurez sans
doute plaisir à voir: monsieur Louis, un soldat qui combattait à quatre
pas de l'empereur à Mont-Saint-Jean...
Le baron de Piombo se leva, jeta un regard furtif sur Louis, et lui dit
d'une voix sardonique:--Monsieur n'est pas décoré?
--Je ne porte plus la Légion-d'Honneur, répondit timidement Louis qui
restait humblement debout.
Ginevra, blessée de l'impolitesse de son père, avança une chaise. La
réponse de l'officier satisfit le vieux serviteur de Napoléon. Madame
Piombo, s'apercevant que les sourcils de son mari reprenaient leur
position naturelle, dit pour ranimer la conversation:--La ressemblance
de monsieur avec Nina Porta est étonnante. Ne trouvez-vous pas que
monsieur a toute la physionomie des Porta?
--Rien de plus naturel, répondit le jeune homme sur qui les yeux
flamboyants de Piombo s'arrêtèrent, Nina était ma soeur...
--Tu es Luigi Porta? demanda le vieillard.
--Oui.
Bartholoméo di Piombo se leva, chancela, fut obligé de s'appuyer sur une
chaise et regarda sa femme. Élisa Piombo vint à lui; puis les deux
vieillards silencieux se donnèrent le bras et sortirent du salon en
abandonnant leur fille avec une sorte d'horreur. Luigi Porta stupéfait
regarda Ginevra, qui devint aussi blanche qu'une statue de marbre et
resta les yeux fixés sur la porte vers laquelle son père et sa mère
avaient disparu: ce silence et cette retraite eurent quelque chose de si
solennel que, pour la première fois peut-être, le sentiment de la
crainte entra dans son coeur. Elle joignit ses mains l'une contre
l'autre avec force, et dit d'une voix si émue qu'elle ne pouvait guère
être entendue que par un amant:--Combien de malheur dans un mot!
--Au nom de notre amour, qu'ai-je donc dit, demanda Luigi Porta.
--Mon père, répondit-elle, ne m'a jamais parlé de notre déplorable
histoire, et j'étais trop jeune quand j'ai quitté la Corse pour la
savoir.
--Nous serions en _vendetta_, demanda Luigi en tremblant.
--Oui. En questionnant ma mère, j'ai appris que les Porta avaient tué
mes frères et brûlé notre maison. Mon père a massacré toute votre
famille. Comment avez-vous survécu, vous qu'il croyait avoir attaché aux
colonnes d'un lit avant de mettre le feu à la maison?
--Je ne sais, répondit Luigi. A six ans j'ai été amené à Gênes, chez un
vieillard nommé Colonna. Aucun détail sur ma famille ne m'a été donné.
Je savais seulement que j'étais orphelin et sans fortune. Ce Colonna me
servait de père, et j'ai porté son nom jusqu'au jour où je suis entré au
service. Comme il m'a fallu des actes pour prouver qui j'étais, le vieux
Colonna m'a dit alors que moi, faible et presque enfant encore, j'avais
des ennemis. Il m'a engagé à ne prendre que le nom de Luigi pour leur
échapper.
--Partez, partez, Luigi, s'écria Ginevra; mais non, je dois vous
accompagner. Tant que vous êtes dans la maison de mon père, vous n'avez
rien à craindre; aussitôt que vous en sortirez, prenez bien garde à
vous! vous marcherez de danger en danger. Mon père a deux Corses à son
service, et si ce n'est pas lui qui menacera vos jours, c'est eux.
--Ginevra, dit-il, cette haine existera-t-elle donc entre nous?
La jeune fille sourit tristement et baissa la tête. Elle la releva
bientôt avec une sorte de fierté, et dit:--O Luigi, il faut que nos
sentiments soient bien purs et bien sincères pour que j'aie la force de
marcher dans la voie où je vais entrer. Mais il s'agit d'un bonheur qui
doit durer toute la vie, n'est-ce pas?
Luigi ne répondit que par un sourire, et pressa la main de Ginevra. La
jeune fille comprit qu'un véritable amour pouvait seul dédaigner en ce
moment les protestations vulgaires. L'expression calme et consciencieuse
des sentiments de Luigi annonçait en quelque sorte leur force et leur
durée. La destinée de ces deux époux fut alors accomplie. Ginevra
entrevit de bien cruels combats à soutenir; mais l'idée d'abandonner
Louis, idée qui peut-être avait flotté dans son âme, s'évanouit
complétement. A lui pour toujours, elle l'entraîna tout à coup avec une
sorte d'énergie hors de l'hôtel, et ne le quitta qu'au moment où il
atteignit la maison dans laquelle Servin lui avait loué un modeste
logement. Quand elle revint chez son père, elle avait pris cette espèce
de sérénité que donne une résolution forte: aucune altération dans ses
manières ne peignit d'inquiétude. Elle leva sur son père et sa mère,
qu'elle trouva prêts à se mettre à table, des yeux dénués de hardiesse
et pleins de douceur; elle vit que sa vieille mère avait pleuré, la
rougeur de ces paupières flétries ébranla un moment son coeur; mais elle
cacha son émotion. Piombo semblait être en proie à une douleur trop
violente, trop concentrée pour qu'il pût la trahir par des expressions
ordinaires. Les gens servirent le dîner auquel personne ne toucha.
L'horreur de la nourriture est un des symptômes qui trahissent les
grandes crises de l'âme. Tous trois se levèrent sans qu'aucun d'eux se
fût adressé la parole. Quand Ginevra fut placée entre son père et sa
mère dans leur grand salon sombre et solennel, Piombo voulut parler,
mais il ne trouva pas de voix; il essaya de marcher, et ne trouva pas de
force, il revint s'asseoir et sonna.
--Jean, dit-il enfin au domestique, allumez du feu, j'ai froid.
Ginevra tressaillit et regarda son père avec anxiété. Le combat qu'il se
livrait devait être horrible, sa figure était bouleversée. Ginevra
connaissait l'étendue du péril qui la menaçait, mais elle ne tremblait
pas; tandis que les regards furtifs que Bartholoméo jetait sur sa fille
semblaient annoncer qu'il craignait en ce moment le caractère dont la
violence était son propre ouvrage. Entre eux, tout devait être extrême.
Aussi la certitude du changement qui pouvait s'opérer dans les
sentiments du père et de la fille animait-elle le visage de la baronne
d'une expression de terreur.
--Ginevra, vous aimez l'ennemi de votre famille, dit enfin Piombo sans
oser regarder sa fille.
--Cela est vrai, répondit-elle.
--Il faut choisir entre lui et nous. Notre _vendetta_ fait partie de
nous-mêmes. Qui n'épouse pas ma vengeance, n'est pas de ma famille.
--Mon choix est fait, répondit Ginevra d'une voix calme.
La tranquillité de sa fille trompa Bartholoméo.
--O ma chère fille! s'écria le vieillard qui montra ses paupières
humectées par des larmes, les premières et les seules qu'il répandit
dans sa vie.
--Je serai sa femme, dit brusquement Ginevra.
Bartholoméo eut comme un éblouissement; mais il recouvra son sang-froid
et répliqua:--Ce mariage ne se fera pas de mon vivant, je n'y
consentirai jamais. Ginevra garda le silence.--Mais, dit le baron en
continuant, songes-tu que Luigi est le fils de celui qui a tué tes
frères?
--Il avait six ans au moment où le crime a été commis, il doit en être
innocent, répondit-elle.
--Un Porta? s'écria Bartholoméo.
--Mais ai-je jamais pu partager cette haine? dit vivement la jeune
fille. M'avez-vous élevée dans cette croyance qu'un Porta était un
monstre? Pouvais-je penser qu'il restât un seul de ceux que vous aviez
tués? N'est-il pas naturel que vous fassiez céder votre _vendetta_ à mes
sentiments?
--Un Porta? dit Piombo. Si son père t'avait jadis trouvée dans ton lit,
tu ne vivrais pas, il t'aurait donné cent fois la mort.
--Cela se peut, répondit-elle, mais son fils m'a donné plus que la vie.
Voir Luigi, c'est un bonheur sans lequel je ne saurais vivre. Luigi m'a
révélé le monde des sentiments. J'ai peut-être aperçu des figures plus
belles encore que la sienne, mais aucune ne m'a autant charmée; j'ai
peut-être entendu des voix... non, non, jamais de plus mélodieuses.
Luigi m'aime, il sera mon mari.
--Jamais, dit Piombo. J'aimerais mieux te voir dans ton cercueil,
Ginevra. Le vieux Corse se leva, se mit à parcourir à grands pas le
salon et laissa échapper ces paroles après des pauses qui peignaient
toute son agitation:--Vous croyez peut-être faire plier ma volonté?
détrompez-vous: je ne veux pas qu'un Porta soit mon gendre. Telle est ma
sentence. Qu'il ne soit plus question de ceci entre nous. Je suis
Bartholoméo di Piombo, entendez-vous, Ginevra?
--Attachez-vous quelque sens mystérieux à ces paroles? demanda-t-elle
froidement.
--Elles signifient que j'ai un poignard, et que je ne crains pas la
justice des hommes. Nous autres Corses, nous allons nous expliquer avec
Dieu.
--Eh bien! dit la fille en se levant, je suis Ginevra di Piombo, et je
déclare que dans six mois je serai la femme de Luigi Porta.--Vous êtes
un tyran, mon père, ajouta-t-elle après une pause effrayante.
Bartholoméo serra ses poings et frappa sur le marbre de la cheminée: Ah!
nous sommes à Paris, dit-il en murmurant.
Il se tut, se croisa les bras, pencha la tête sur sa poitrine et ne
prononça plus une seule parole pendant toute la soirée. Après avoir
exprimé sa volonté, la jeune fille affecta un sang-froid incroyable,
elle se mit au piano, chanta, joua des morceaux ravissants avec une
grâce et un sentiment qui annonçaient une parfaite liberté d'esprit,
triomphant ainsi de son père dont le front ne paraissait pas s'adoucir.
Le vieillard ressentit cruellement cette tacite injure, et recueillit en
ce moment un des fruits amers de l'éducation qu'il avait donnée à sa
fille. Le respect est une barrière qui protége autant un père et une
mère que les enfants, en évitant à ceux-là des chagrins, à ceux-ci des
remords. Le lendemain Ginevra, qui voulut sortir à l'heure où elle avait
coutume de se rendre à l'atelier, trouva la porte de l'hôtel fermée pour
elle; mais elle eut bientôt inventé un moyen d'instruire Luigi Porta des
sévérités paternelles. Une femme de chambre qui ne savait pas lire fit
parvenir au jeune officier la lettre que lui écrivit Ginevra. Pendant
cinq jours les deux amants surent correspondre, grâce à ces ruses qu'on
sait toujours machiner à vingt ans. Le père et la fille se parlèrent
rarement. Tous deux gardaient au fond du coeur un principe de haine, ils
souffraient, mais orgueilleusement et en silence. En reconnaissant
combien étaient forts les liens d'amour qui les attachaient l'un à
l'autre, ils essayaient de les briser, sans pouvoir y parvenir. Nulle
pensée douce ne venait plus comme autrefois égayer les traits sévères de
Bartholoméo quand il contemplait sa Ginevra. La jeune fille avait
quelque chose de farouche en regardant son père, et le reproche siégeait
sur son front d'innocence; elle se livrait bien à d'heureuses pensées,
mais parfois des remords semblaient ternir ses yeux. Il n'était même pas
difficile de deviner qu'elle ne pourrait jamais jouir tranquillement
d'une félicité qui faisait le malheur de ses parents. Chez Bartholoméo
comme chez sa fille, toutes les irrésolutions causées par la bonté
native de leurs âmes devaient néanmoins échouer devant leur fierté,
devant la rancune particulière aux Corses. Ils s'encourageaient l'un et
l'autre dans leur colère et fermaient les yeux sur l'avenir. Peut-être
aussi se flattaient-ils mutuellement que l'un céderait à l'autre.
Le jour de la naissance de Ginevra, sa mère, désespérée de cette
désunion qui prenait un caractère grave, médita de réconcilier le père
et la fille, grâce aux souvenirs de cet anniversaire. Ils étaient réunis
tous trois dans la chambre de Bartholoméo. Ginevra devina l'intention de
sa mère à l'hésitation peinte sur son visage et sourit tristement. En ce
moment un domestique annonça deux notaires accompagnés de plusieurs
témoins qui entrèrent. Bartholoméo regarda fixement ces hommes, dont les
figures froidement compassées avaient quelque chose de blessant pour des
âmes aussi passionnées que l'étaient celles des trois principaux acteurs
de cette scène. Le vieillard se tourna vers sa fille d'un air inquiet,
il vit sur son visage un sourire de triomphe qui lui fit soupçonner
quelque catastrophe; mais il affecta de garder, à la manière des
sauvages, une immobilité mensongère en regardant les deux notaires avec
une sorte de curiosité calme. Les étrangers s'assirent après y avoir été
invités par un geste du vieillard.
--Monsieur est sans doute monsieur le baron de Piombo, demanda le plus
âgé des notaires.
Bartholoméo s'inclina. Le notaire fit un léger mouvement de tête,
regarda la jeune fille avec la sournoise expression d'un garde du
commerce qui surprend un débiteur; et il tira sa tabatière, l'ouvrit, y
prit une pincée de tabac, se mit à la humer à petits coups en cherchant
les premières phrases de son discours; puis en les prononçant, il fit
des repos continuels (manoeuvre oratoire que ce signe--représentera
très-imparfaitement).
--Monsieur, dit-il, je suis monsieur Roguin, notaire de
mademoiselle votre fille, et nous venons,--mon collègue et moi,--pour
accomplir levoeu de la loi et--mettre un terme aux divisions
qui--paraîtraient--s'être introduites--entre vous et mademoiselle votre
fille,--au sujet--de--son--mariage avec monsieur Luigi Porta.
Cette phrase, assez pédantesquement débitée, parut probablement trop
belle à maître Roguin pour qu'on pût la comprendre d'un seul coup, il
s'arrêta en regardant Bartholoméo avec une expression particulière aux
gens d'affaires et qui tient le milieu entre la servilité et la
familiarité. Habitués à feindre beaucoup d'intérêt pour les personnes
auxquelles ils parlent, les notaires finissent par faire contracter à
leur figure une grimace qu'ils revêtent et quittent comme leur _pallium_
officiel. Ce masque de bienveillance, dont le mécanisme est si facile à
saisir, irrita tellement Bartholoméo qu'il lui fallut rappeler toute sa
raison pour ne pas jeter monsieur Roguin par les fenêtres; une
expression de colère se glissa dans ses rides, et en la voyant le
notaire se dit en lui-même:--Je produis de l'effet.
--Mais, reprit-il d'une voix mielleuse, monsieur le baron, dans ces
sortes d'occasions, notre ministère commence toujours par être
essentiellement conciliateur.--Daignez donc avoir la bonté de
m'entendre.--Il est évident que mademoiselle Ginevra Piombo--atteint
aujourd'hui même--l'âge auquel il suffit de faire des actes respectueux
pour qu'il soit passé outre à la célébration d'un mariage--malgré le
défaut de consentement des parents. Or,--il est d'usage dans les
familles--qui jouissent d'une certaine considération,--qui appartiennent
à la société,--qui conservent quelque dignité,--auxquelles il importe
enfin de ne pas donner au public le secret de leurs divisions,--et qui
d'ailleurs ne veulent pas se nuire à elles-mêmes en frappant de
réprobation l'avenir de deux jeunes époux (car--c'est se nuire à
soi-même!)--il est d'usage,--dis-je,--parmi ces familles honorables--de
ne pas laisser subsister des actes semblables,--qui restent, qui--sont
des monuments d'une division qui--finit--par cesser.--Du moment,
monsieur, où une jeune personne a recours aux actes respectueux, elle
annonce une intention trop décidée pour qu'un père et--une mère,
ajouta-t-il en se tournant vers la baronne, puissent espérer de lui voir
suivre leurs avis.--La résistance paternelle étant alors nulle--par ce
fait--d'abord,--puis étant infirmée par la loi, il est constant que tout
homme sage, après avoir fait une dernière remontrance à son enfant, lui
donne la liberté de...
Monsieur Roguin s'arrêta en s'apercevant qu'il pouvait parler deux
heures ainsi, sans obtenir de réponse, et il éprouva d'ailleurs une
émotion particulière à l'aspect de l'homme qu'il essayait de convertir.
Il s'était fait une révolution extraordinaire sur le visage de
Bartholoméo: toutes ses rides contractées lui donnaient un air de
cruauté indéfinissable, et il jetait sur le notaire un regard de tigre.
La baronne demeurait muette et passive. Ginevra, calme et résolue,
attendait, elle savait que la voix du notaire était plus puissante que
la sienne, et alors elle semblait s'être décidée à garder le silence. Au
moment où Roguin se tut, cette scène devint si effrayante que les
témoins étrangers tremblèrent: jamais peut-être ils n'avaient été
frappés par un semblable silence. Les notaires se regardèrent comme pour
se consulter, se levèrent et allèrent ensemble à la croisée.
--As-tu jamais rencontré des clients fabriqués comme ceux-là? demanda
Roguin à son confrère.
--Il n'y a rien à en tirer, répondit le plus jeune. A ta place, moi, je
m'en tiendrais à la lecture de mon acte. Le vieux ne me paraît pas
amusant, il est colère, et tu ne gagneras rien à vouloir _discuter_ avec
lui...
Monsieur Roguin lut un papier timbré contenant un procès-verbal rédigé à
l'avance et demanda froidement à Bartholoméo quelle était sa réponse.
--Il y a donc en France des lois qui détruisent le pouvoir paternel?
demanda le Corse.
--Monsieur... dit Roguin de sa voix mielleuse.
--Qui arrachent une fille à son père?
--Monsieur...
--Qui privent un vieillard de sa dernière consolation?
--Monsieur, votre fille ne vous appartient que...
--Qui le tuent?
--Monsieur, permettez!
Rien n'est plus affreux que le sang-froid et les raisonnements exacts
d'un notaire au milieu des scènes passionnées où ils ont coutume
d'intervenir. Les figures que Piombo voyait lui semblèrent échappées de
l'enfer, sa rage froide et concentrée ne connut plus de bornes au moment
où la voix calme et presque flûtée de son petit antagoniste prononça ce
fatal: «_permettez?_» Il sauta sur un long poignard suspendu par un clou
au-dessus de sa cheminée et s'élança sur sa fille. Le plus jeune des
deux notaires et l'un des témoins se jetèrent entre lui et Ginevra; mais
Bartholoméo renversa brutalement les deux conciliateurs en leur montrant
une figure en feu et des yeux flamboyants qui paraissaient plus
terribles que ne l'était la clarté du poignard. Quand Ginevra se vit en
présence de son père, elle le regarda fixement d'un air de triomphe,
s'avança lentement vers lui et s'agenouilla.
--Non! non! je ne saurais, dit-il en lançant si violemment son arme
qu'elle alla s'enfoncer dans la boiserie.
--Eh! bien, grâce! grâce, dit-elle. Vous hésitez à me donner la mort, et
vous me refusez la vie. O mon père, jamais je ne vous ai tant aimé,
accordez-moi Luigi! Je vous demande votre consentement à genoux: une
fille peut s'humilier devant son père; mon Luigi, ou je meurs.
L'irritation violente qui la suffoquait l'empêcha de continuer, elle ne
trouvait plus de voix; ses efforts convulsifs disaient assez qu'elle
était entre la vie et la mort. Bartholoméo repoussa durement sa fille.
--Fuis, dit-il. La Luigi Porta ne saurait être une Piombo. Je n'ai plus
de fille! Je n'ai pas la force de te maudire; mais je t'abandonne, et tu
n'as plus de père. Ma Ginevra Piombo est enterrée là, s'écria-t-il d'un
son de voix profond, en se pressant fortement le coeur.--Sors donc,
malheureuse, ajouta-t-il après un moment de silence, sors, et ne
reparais plus devant moi. Puis, il prit Ginevra par le bras, et la
conduisit silencieusement hors de la maison.
Luigi, s'écria Ginevra en entrant dans le modeste appartement où était
l'officier, mon Luigi, nous n'avons d'autre fortune que notre amour.
--Nous sommes plus riches que tous les rois de la terre, répondit-il.
--Mon père et ma mère m'ont abandonnée, dit-elle avec une profonde
mélancolie.
--Je t'aimerai pour eux.
--Nous serons donc bien heureux? s'écria-t elle avec une gaieté qui eut
quelque chose d'effrayant.
--Et toujours, répondit-il en la serrant sur son coeur.
Le lendemain du jour où Ginevra quitta la maison de son père, elle alla
prier madame Servin de lui accorder un asile et sa protection jusqu'à
l'époque fixée par la loi pour son mariage avec Luigi Porta. Là,
commença pour elle l'apprentissage des chagrins que le monde sème autour
de ceux qui ne suivent pas ses usages. Très-affligée du tort que
l'aventure de Ginevra faisait à son mari, madame Servin reçut froidement
la fugitive, et lui apprit par des paroles poliment circonspectes
qu'elle ne devait pas compter sur son appui. Trop fière pour insister,
mais étonnée d'un égoïsme auquel elle n'était pas habituée, la jeune
Corse alla se loger dans l'hôtel garni le plus voisin de la maison où
demeurait Luigi. Le fils des Porta vint passer toutes ses journées aux
pieds de sa future; son jeune amour, la pureté de ses paroles,
dissipaient les nuages que la réprobation paternelle amassait sur le
front de la fille bannie, et il lui peignait l'avenir si beau qu'elle
finissait par sourire, sans néanmoins oublier la rigueur de ses parents.
Un matin, la servante de l'hôtel remit à Ginevra plusieurs malles qui
contenaient des étoffes, du linge, et une foule de choses nécessaires à
une jeune femme qui se met en ménage; elle reconnut dans cet envoi la
prévoyante bonté d'une mère, car en visitant ces présents, elle trouva
une bourse où la baronne avait mis la somme qui appartenait à sa fille,
en y joignant le fruit de ses économies. L'argent était accompagné d'une
lettre où la mère conjurait la fille d'abandonner son funeste projet de
mariage, s'il en était encore temps; il lui avait fallu, disait-elle,
des précautions inouïes pour faire parvenir ces faibles secours à
Ginevra; elle la suppliait de ne pas l'accuser de dureté, si par la
suite elle la laissait dans l'abandon, elle craignait de ne pouvoir plus
l'assister, elle la bénissait, lui souhaitait de trouver le bonheur dans
ce fatal mariage, si elle persistait, en lui assurant qu'elle ne pensait
qu'à sa fille chérie. En cet endroit, des larmes avaient effacé
plusieurs mots de la lettre.
--O ma mère! s'écria Ginevra tout attendrie. Elle éprouvait le besoin de
se jeter à ses genoux, de la voir, et de respirer l'air bienfaisant de
la maison paternelle; elle s'élançait déjà, quand Luigi entra; elle le
regarda, et sa tendresse filiale s'évanouit, ses larmes se séchèrent,
elle ne se sentit pas la force d'abandonner cet enfant si malheureux et
si aimant. Être le seul espoir d'une noble créature, l'aimer et
l'abandonner... ce sacrifice est une trahison dont sont incapables de
jeunes âmes. Ginevra eut la générosité d'ensevelir sa douleur au fond de
son âme.
Enfin, le jour du mariage arriva. Ginevra ne vit personne autour
d'elle. Luigi avait profité du moment où elle s'habillait pour aller
chercher les témoins nécessaires à la signature de leur acte de mariage.
Ces témoins étaient de braves gens. L'un, ancien maréchal-des-logis de
hussards, avait contracté, à l'armée, envers Luigi, de ces obligations
qui ne s'effacent jamais du coeur d'un honnête homme; il s'était mis
loueur de voitures et possédait quelques fiacres. L'autre, entrepreneur
de maçonnerie, était le propriétaire de la maison où les nouveaux époux
devaient demeurer. Chacun d'eux se fit accompagner par un ami, puis tous
quatre vinrent avec Luigi prendre la mariée. Peu accoutumés aux grimaces
sociales, et ne voyant rien que de très-simple dans le service qu'ils
rendaient à Luigi, ces gens s'étaient habillés proprement, mais sans
luxe, et rien n'annonçait le joyeux cortége d'une noce. Ginevra,
elle-même, se mit très-simplement afin de se conformer à sa fortune;
néanmoins sa beauté avait quelque chose de si noble et de si imposant,
qu'à son aspect la parole expira sur les lèvres des témoins qui se
crurent obligés de lui adresser un compliment; ils la saluèrent avec
respect, elle s'inclina; ils la regardèrent en silence et ne surent plus
que l'admirer. Cette réserve jeta du froid entre eux. La joie ne peut
éclater que parmi des gens qui se sentent égaux. Le hasard voulut donc
que tout fût sombre et grave autour des deux fiancés, rien ne refléta
leur félicité. L'église et la mairie n'étaient pas très-éloignées de
l'hôtel. Les deux Corses, suivis des quatre témoins que leur imposait la
loi, voulurent y aller à pied, dans une simplicité qui dépouilla de tout
appareil cette grande scène de la vie sociale. Ils trouvèrent dans la
cour de la mairie une foule d'équipages qui annonçaient nombreuse
compagnie, ils montèrent et arrivèrent à une grande salle où les mariés,
dont le bonheur était indiqué pour ce jour-là, attendaient assez
impatiemment le maire du quartier. Ginevra s'assit près de Luigi au bout
d'un grand banc, et leurs témoins restèrent debout, faute de siéges.
Deux mariées pompeusement habillées de blanc, chargées de rubans, de
dentelles, de perles, et couronnées de bouquets de fleurs d'oranger dont
les boutons satinés tremblaient sous leur voile, étaient entourées de
leurs familles joyeuses, et accompagnées de leurs mères, qu'elles
regardaient d'un air à la fois satisfait et craintif; tous les yeux
réfléchissaient leur bonheur, et chaque figure semblait leur prodiguer
des bénédictions. Les pères, les témoins, les frères, les soeurs
allaient et venaient, comme un essaim se jouant dans un rayon de soleil
qui va disparaître. Chacun semblait comprendre la valeur de ce moment
fugitif où, dans la vie, le coeur se trouve entre deux espérances: les
souhaits du passé, les promesses de l'avenir. A cet aspect, Ginevra
sentit son coeur se gonfler, et pressa le bras de Luigi qui lui lança un
regard. Une larme roula dans les yeux du jeune Corse, il ne comprit
jamais mieux qu'alors tout ce que sa Ginevra lui sacrifiait. Cette larme
précieuse fit oublier à la jeune fille l'abandon dans lequel elle se
trouvait. L'amour versa des trésors de lumière entre les deux amants qui
ne virent plus qu'eux au milieu de ce tumulte: ils étaient là, seuls,
dans cette foule, tels qu'ils devaient être dans la vie. Leurs témoins
indifférents à la cérémonie, causaient tranquillement de leurs affaires.
--L'avoine est bien chère, disait le maréchal-des-logis au maçon.
--Elle n'est pas encore si renchérie que le plâtre, proportion gardée,
répondit l'entrepreneur.
Et ils firent un tour dans la salle.
--Comme on perd du temps ici! s'écria le maçon en remettant dans sa
poche une grosse montre d'argent.
Luigi et Ginevra, serrés l'un contre l'autre, semblaient ne faire qu'une
même personne. Certes, un poëte aurait admiré ces deux têtes unies par
un même sentiment, également colorées, mélancoliques et silencieuses en
présence de deux noces bourdonnant, devant quatre familles tumultueuses,
étincelant de diamants, de fleurs, et dont la gaieté avait quelque chose
de passager. Tout ce que ces groupes bruyants et splendides mettaient de
joie en dehors, Luigi et Ginevra l'ensevelissaient au fond de leurs
coeurs. D'un côté, le grossier fracas du plaisir; de l'autre, le délicat
silence des âmes joyeuses: la terre et le ciel. Mais la tremblante
Ginevra ne sut pas entièrement dépouiller les faiblesses de la femme.
Superstitieuse comme une Italienne, elle voulut voir un présage dans ce
contraste, et garda au fond de son coeur un sentiment d'effroi,
invincible autant que son amour.
Tout à coup, un garçon de bureau à la livrée de la ville ouvrit une
porte à deux battants, l'on fit silence, et sa voix retentit comme un
glapissement en appelant monsieur Luigi da Porta et mademoiselle Ginevra
di Piombo. Ce moment causa quelque embarras aux deux fiancés. La
célébrité du nom de Piombo attira l'attention, les spectateurs
cherchèrent une noce qui semblait devoir être somptueuse. Ginevra se
leva, ses regards foudroyants d'orgueil imposèrent à toute la foule,
elle donna le bras à Luigi, et marcha d'un pas ferme suivie de ses
témoins. Un murmure d'étonnement qui alla croissant, un chuchotement
général vint rappeler à Ginevra que le monde lui demandait compte de
l'absence de ses parents: la malédiction paternelle semblait la
poursuivre.
--Attendez les familles, dit le maire à l'employé qui lisait promptement
les actes.
--Le père et la mère protestent, répondit flegmatiquement le secrétaire.
--Des deux côtés? reprit le maire.
--L'époux est orphelin.
--Où sont les témoins?
--Les voici, répondit encore le secrétaire en montrant les quatre hommes
immobiles et muets qui, les bras croisés, ressemblaient à des statues.
--Mais, s'il y a protestation? dit le maire.
--Les actes respectueux ont été légalement faits, répliqua l'employé en
se levant pour transmettre au fonctionnaire les pièces annexées à l'acte
de mariage.
Ce débat bureaucratique eut quelque chose de flétrissant et contenait en
peu de mots toute une histoire. La haine des Porta et des Piombo, de
terribles passions furent inscrites sur une page de l'État Civil, comme
sur la pierre d'un tombeau sont gravées en quelques lignes les annales
d'un peuple, et souvent même en un mot: Robespierre ou Napoléon. Ginevra
tremblait. Semblable à la colombe qui, traversant les mers, n'avait que
l'arche pour poser ses pieds, elle ne pouvait réfugier son regard que
dans les yeux de Luigi, car tout était triste et froid autour d'elle. Le
maire avait un air improbateur et sévère, et son commis regardait les
deux époux avec une curiosité malveillante. Rien n'eut jamais moins
l'air d'une fête. Comme toutes les choses de la vie humaine quand elles
sont dépouillées de leurs accessoires, ce fut un fait simple en
lui-même, immense par la pensée. Après quelques interrogations
auxquelles les époux répondirent, après quelques paroles marmottées par
le maire, et après l'apposition de leurs signatures sur le registre,
Luigi et Ginevra furent unis. Les deux jeunes Corses, dont l'alliance
offrait toute la poésie consacrée par le génie dans celle de Roméo et
Juliette, traversèrent deux haies de parents joyeux auxquels ils
n'appartenaient pas, et qui s'impatientaient presque du retard que leur
causait ce mariage si triste en apparence. Quand la jeune fille se
trouva dans la cour de la mairie et sous le ciel, un soupir s'échappa de
son sein.
--Oh! toute une vie de soins et d'amour suffira-t-elle pour reconnaître
le courage et la tendresse de ma Ginevra? lui dit Luigi.
A ces mots accompagnés par des larmes de bonheur, la mariée oublia
toutes ses souffrances; car elle avait souffert de se présenter devant
le monde, en réclamant un bonheur que sa famille refusait de
sanctionner.
--Pourquoi les hommes se mettent-ils donc entre nous? dit-elle avec une
naïveté de sentiment qui ravit Luigi.
Le plaisir rendit les deux époux plus légers. Ils ne virent ni ciel, ni
terre, ni maisons, et volèrent comme avec des ailes vers l'église.
Enfin, ils arrivèrent à une petite chapelle obscure et devant un autel
sans pompe où un vieux prêtre célébra leur union. Là, comme à la mairie,
ils furent entourés par les deux noces qui les persécutaient de leur
éclat. L'église, pleine d'amis et de parents, retentissait du bruit que
faisaient les carrosses, les bedeaux, les suisses, les prêtres. Des
autels brillaient de tout le luxe ecclésiastique, les couronnes de
fleurs d'oranger qui paraient les statues de la Vierge semblaient être
neuves. On ne voyait que fleurs, que parfums, que cierges étincelants,
que coussins de velours brodés d'or. Dieu paraissait être complice de
cette joie d'un jour. Quand il fallut tenir au-dessus des têtes de Luigi
et de Ginevra ce symbole d'union éternelle, ce joug de satin blanc,
doux, brillant, léger pour les uns, et de plomb pour le plus grand
nombre, le prêtre chercha, mais en vain, les jeunes garçons qui
remplissent ce joyeux office: deux des témoins les remplacèrent.
L'ecclésiastique fit à la hâte une instruction aux époux sur les périls
de la vie, sur les devoirs qu'ils enseigneraient un jour à leurs
enfants; et, à ce sujet, il glissa un reproche indirect sur l'absence
des parents de Ginevra; puis, après les avoir unis devant Dieu, comme le
maire les avait unis devant la Loi, il acheva sa messe et les quitta.
--Dieu les bénisse! dit Vergniaud au maçon sous le porche de l'église.
Jamais deux créatures ne furent mieux faites l'une pour l'autre. Les
parents de cette fille-là sont des infirmes. Je ne connais pas de soldat
plus brave que le colonel Louis! Si tout le monde s'était comporté comme
lui, _l'autre_ y serait encore.
La bénédiction du soldat, la seule qui, dans ce jour, leur eût été
donnée, répandit comme un baume sur le coeur de Ginevra.
Ils se séparèrent en se serrant la main, et Luigi remercia cordialement
son propriétaire.
--Adieu, mon brave, dit Luigi au maréchal, je te remercie.
--Tout à votre service, mon colonel. Ame, individu, chevaux et voitures,
chez moi tout est à vous.
--Comme il t'aime! dit Ginevra.
Luigi entraîna vivement sa mariée à la maison qu'ils devaient habiter,
ils atteignirent bientôt leur modeste appartement; et, là, quand la
porte fut refermée, Luigi prit sa femme dans ses bras en s'écriant:--O
ma Ginevra! car maintenant tu es à moi, ici est la véritable fête. Ici,
reprit-il, tout nous sourira.
Ils parcoururent ensemble les trois chambres qui composaient leur
logement. La pièce d'entrée servait de salon et de salle à manger. A
droite se trouvait une chambre à coucher, à gauche un grand cabinet que
Luigi avait fait arranger pour sa chère femme et où elle trouva les
chevalets, la boîte à couleurs, les plâtres, les modèles, les
mannequins, les tableaux, les portefeuilles, enfin tout le mobilier de
l'artiste.
--Je travaillerai donc là, dit-elle avec une expression enfantine. Elle
regarda longtemps la tenture, les meubles, et toujours elle se
retournait vers Luigi pour le remercier, car il y avait une sorte de
magnificence dans ce petit réduit: une bibliothèque contenait les livres
favoris de Ginevra, au fond était un piano. Elle s'assit sur un divan,
attira Luigi près d'elle, et lui serrant la main:--Tu as bon goût,
dit-elle d'une voix caressante.
--Tes paroles me font bien heureux, dit-il.
--Mais voyons donc tout, demanda Ginevra, à qui Luigi avait fait un
mystère des ornements de cette retraite.
Ils allèrent alors vers une chambre nuptiale, fraîche et blanche comme
une vierge.
--Oh! sortons, dit Luigi en riant.
--Mais je veux tout voir. Et l'impérieuse Ginevra visita l'ameublement
avec le soin curieux d'un antiquaire examinant une médaille, elle toucha
les soieries et passa tout en revue avec le contentement naïf d'une
jeune mariée qui déploie les richesses de sa corbeille. Nous commençons
par nous ruiner, dit-elle d'un air moitié joyeux, moitié chagrin.
--C'est vrai! tout l'arriéré de ma solde est là, répondit Luigi. Je l'ai
vendu à un brave homme nommé Gigonnet.
--Pourquoi? reprit-elle d'un ton de reproche où perçait une satisfaction
secrète. Crois-tu que je serais moins heureuse sous un toit? Mais,
reprit-elle, tout cela est bien joli, et c'est à nous. Luigi la
contemplait avec tant d'enthousiasme qu'elle baissa les yeux et lui
dit:--Allons voir le reste.
Au-dessus de ces trois chambres, sous les toits, il y avait un cabinet
pour Luigi, une cuisine et une chambre de domestique. Ginevra fut
satisfaite de son petit domaine, quoique la vue s'y trouvât bornée par
le large mur d'une maison voisine, et que la cour d'où venait le jour
fût sombre. Mais les deux amants avaient le coeur si joyeux, mais
l'espérance leur embellissait si bien l'avenir, qu'ils ne voulurent
apercevoir que de charmantes images dans leur mystérieux asile. Ils
étaient au fond de cette vaste maison et perdus dans l'immensité de
Paris comme deux perles dans leur nacre, au sein des profondes mers:
pour tout autre c'eût été une prison, pour eux ce fut un paradis. Les
premiers jours de leur union appartinrent à l'amour. Il leur fut trop
difficile de se vouer tout à coup au travail, et ils ne surent pas
résister au charme de leur propre passion. Luigi restait des heures
entières couché aux pieds de sa femme, admirant la couleur de ses
cheveux, la coupe de son front, le ravissant encadrement de ses yeux, la
pureté, la blancheur des deux arcs sous lesquels ils glissaient
lentement en exprimant le bonheur d'un amour satisfait. Ginevra
caressait la chevelure de son Luigi sans se lasser de contempler,
suivant une de ses expressions, la _beltà folgorante_ de ce jeune homme,
la finesse de ses traits; toujours séduite par la noblesse de ses
manières, comme elle le séduisait toujours par la grâce des siennes. Ils
jouaient comme des enfants avec des riens, ces riens les ramenaient
toujours à leur passion, et ils ne cessaient leurs jeux que pour tomber
dans la rêverie du _far niente_. Un air chanté par Ginevra leur
reproduisait encore les nuances délicieuses de leur amour. Puis,
unissant leurs pas comme ils avaient uni leurs âmes, ils parcouraient
les campagnes en y retrouvant leur amour partout, dans les fleurs, sur
les cieux, au sein des teintes ardentes du soleil couchant; ils le
lisaient jusque sur les nuées capricieuses qui se combattaient dans les
airs. Une journée ne ressemblait jamais à la précédente, leur amour
allait croissant parce qu'il était vrai. Ils s'étaient éprouvés en peu
de jours, et avaient instinctivement reconnu que leurs âmes étaient de
celles dont les richesses inépuisables semblent toujours promettre de
nouvelles jouissances pour l'avenir. C'était l'amour dans toute sa
naïveté, avec ses interminables causeries, ses phrases inachevées, ses
longs silences, son repos oriental et sa fougue. Luigi et Ginevra
avaient tout compris de l'amour. L'amour n'est-il pas comme la mer qui,
vue superficiellement ou à la hâte, est accusée de monotonie par les
âmes vulgaires, tandis que certains êtres privilégiés peuvent passer
leur vie à l'admirer en y trouvant sans cesse de changeants phénomènes
qui les ravissent?
Cependant, un jour, la prévoyance vint tirer les jeunes époux de leur
Éden, il était devenu nécessaire de travailler pour vivre. Ginevra qui
possédait un talent particulier pour imiter les vieux tableaux, se mit à
faire des copies et se forma une clientèle parmi les brocanteurs. De son
côté, Luigi chercha très-activement de l'occupation; mais il était fort
difficile à un jeune officier, dont tous les talents se bornaient à bien
connaître la stratégie, de trouver de l'emploi à Paris. Enfin, un jour
que, lassé de ses vains efforts, il avait le désespoir dans l'âme en
voyant que le fardeau de leur existence tombait tout entier sur Ginevra,
il songea à tirer parti de son écriture, qui était fort belle. Avec une
constance dont sa femme lui donnait l'exemple, il alla solliciter les
avoués, les notaires, les avocats de Paris. La franchise de ses
manières, sa situation intéressèrent vivement en sa faveur, et il obtint
assez d'expéditions pour être obligé de se faire aider par des jeunes
gens. Insensiblement il entreprit les écritures en grand. Le produit de
ce bureau, le prix des tableaux de Ginevra, finirent par mettre le jeune
ménage dans une aisance qui le rendit fier, car elle provenait de son
industrie. Ce fut pour eux le plus beau moment de leur vie. Les journées
s'écoulaient rapidement entre les occupations et les joies de l'amour.
Le soir, après avoir bien travaillé, ils se retrouvaient avec bonheur
dans la cellule de Ginevra. La musique les consolait de leurs fatigues.
Jamais une expression de mélancolie ne vint obscurcir les traits de la
jeune femme, et jamais elle ne se permit une plainte. Elle savait
toujours apparaître à son Luigi le sourire sur les lèvres et les yeux
rayonnants. Tous deux caressaient une pensée dominante qui leur eût fait
trouver du plaisir aux travaux les plus rudes: Ginevra se disait qu'elle
travaillait pour Luigi, et Luigi pour Ginevra. Parfois, en l'absence de
son mari, la jeune femme songeait au bonheur parfait qu'elle aurait eu
si cette vie d'amour s'était écoulée en présence de son père et de sa
mère, elle tombait alors dans une mélancolie profonde en éprouvant la
puissance des remords; de sombres tableaux passaient comme des ombres
dans son imagination: elle voyait son vieux père seul ou sa mère
pleurant le soir et dérobant ses larmes à l'inexorable Piombo; ces deux
têtes blanches et graves se dressaient soudain devant elle, il lui
semblait qu'elle ne devait plus les contempler qu'à la lueur fantastique
du souvenir. Cette idée la poursuivait comme un pressentiment. Elle
célébra l'anniversaire de son mariage en donnant à son mari un portrait
qu'il avait souvent désiré, celui de sa Ginevra. Jamais la jeune artiste
n'avait rien composé de si remarquable. A part une ressemblance
parfaite, l'éclat de sa beauté, la pureté de ses sentiments, le bonheur
de l'amour, y étaient rendus avec une sorte de magie. Le chef-d'oeuvre
fut inauguré. Ils passèrent encore une autre année au sein de l'aisance.
L'histoire de leur vie peut se faire alors en trois mots: _Ils étaient
heureux_. Il ne leur arriva donc aucun événement qui mérite d'être
rapporté.
Au commencement de l'hiver de l'année 1819, les marchands de tableaux
conseillèrent à Ginevra de leur donner autre chose que des copies; ils
ne pouvaient plus les vendre avantageusement par suite de la
concurrence. Madame Porta reconnut le tort qu'elle avait eu de ne pas
s'exercer à peindre des tableaux de genre qui lui auraient acquis un
nom, elle entreprit de faire des portraits; mais elle eut à lutter
contre une foule d'artistes encore moins riches qu'elle ne l'était.
Cependant, comme Luigi et Ginevra avaient amassé quelque argent, ils ne
désespérèrent pas de l'avenir. A la fin de l'hiver de cette même année,
Luigi travailla sans relâche. Lui aussi luttait contre des concurrents:
le prix des écritures avait tellement baissé, qu'il ne pouvait plus
employer personne, et se trouvait dans la nécessité de consacrer plus de
temps qu'autrefois à son labeur pour en retirer la même somme. Sa femme
avait fini plusieurs tableaux qui n'étaient pas sans mérite; mais les
marchands achetaient à peine ceux des artistes en réputation. Ginevra
les offrit à vil prix sans pouvoir les vendre. La situation de ce ménage
eut quelque chose d'épouvantable; les âmes des deux époux nageaient dans
le bonheur, l'amour les accablait de ses trésors, la pauvreté se levait
comme un squelette au milieu de cette moisson du plaisir, et ils se
cachaient l'un à l'autre leurs inquiétudes. Au moment où Ginevra se
sentait près de pleurer en voyant son Luigi souffrant, elle le comblait
de caresses. De même Luigi gardait un noir chagrin au fond de son coeur
en exprimant à Ginevra le plus tendre amour. Ils cherchaient une
compensation à leurs maux dans l'exaltation de leurs sentiments, et
leurs paroles, leurs joies, leurs jeux s'empreignaient d'une espèce de
frénésie. Ils avaient peur de l'avenir. Quel est le sentiment dont la
force puisse se comparer à celle d'une passion qui doit cesser le
lendemain, tuée par la mort ou par la nécessité? Quand ils se parlaient
de leur indigence, ils éprouvaient le besoin de se tromper l'un et
l'autre, et saisissaient avec une égale ardeur le plus léger espoir. Une
nuit, Ginevra chercha vainement Luigi auprès d'elle, et se leva tout
effrayée. Une faible lueur qui se dessinait sur le mur noir de la petite
cour lui fit deviner que son mari travaillait pendant la nuit. Luigi
attendait que sa femme fût endormie avant de monter à son cabinet.
Quatre heures sonnèrent, le jour commençait à poindre, Ginevra se
recoucha et feignit de dormir. Luigi revint accablé de fatigue et de
sommeil, et Ginevra regarda douloureusement cette belle figure sur
laquelle les travaux et les soucis imprimaient déjà quelques rides. Des
larmes roulèrent dans les yeux de la jeune femme.
--C'est pour moi qu'il passe les nuits à écrire, dit-elle.
Une pensée sécha ses larmes. Elle songeait à imiter Luigi. Le jour même,
elle alla chez un riche marchand d'estampes, et à l'aide d'une lettre de
recommandation qu'elle se fit donner pour le négociant par Élie Magus,
un de ses marchands de tableaux, elle obtint une entreprise de
coloriages. Le jour, elle peignait et s'occupait des soins du ménage;
puis quand la nuit arrivait, elle coloriait des gravures. Ainsi, ces
deux jeunes gens, épris d'amour, n'entraient au lit nuptial que pour en
sortir; ils feignaient tous deux de dormir, et par dévouement se
quittaient aussitôt que l'un avait trompé l'autre. Une nuit, Luigi
succombant à l'espèce de fièvre que lui causait un travail sous le poids
duquel il commençait à plier, se leva pour ouvrir la lucarne de son
cabinet; il respirait l'air pur du matin, et semblait oublier ses
douleurs à l'aspect du ciel, quand en abaissant ses regards il aperçut
une forte lueur sur le mur qui faisait face aux fenêtres de
l'appartement de Ginevra; le malheureux, qui devina tout, descendit,
marcha doucement et surprit sa femme au milieu de son atelier enluminant
des gravures.
--Oh! Ginevra! s'écria-t-il.
Elle fit un saut convulsif sur sa chaise et rougit.
--Pouvais-je dormir tandis que tu t'épuisais de fatigue? dit-elle.
--Mais c'est à moi seul qu'appartient le droit de travailler ainsi.
--Puis-je rester oisive, répondit la jeune femme dont les yeux se
mouillèrent de larmes, quand je sais que chaque morceau de pain nous
coûte presque une goutte de ton sang? Je mourrais si je ne joignais pas
mes efforts aux tiens. Tout ne doit-il pas être commun entre nous,
plaisirs et peines?
--Elle a froid, s'écria Luigi avec désespoir. Ferme donc mieux ton châle
sur ta poitrine, ma Ginevra, la nuit est humide et fraîche.
Ils vinrent devant la fenêtre, la jeune femme appuya sa tête sur le sein
de son bien-aimé qui la tenait par la taille, et tous deux ensevelis
dans un silence profond, regardèrent le ciel que l'aube éclairait
lentement. Des nuages d'une teinte grise se succédèrent rapidement, et
l'orient devint de plus en plus lumineux.
--Vois-tu, dit Ginevra, c'est un présage: nous serons heureux.
--Oui, au ciel, répondit Luigi avec un sourire amer. O Ginevra! toi qui
méritais tous les trésors de la terre...
--J'ai ton coeur, dit-elle avec un accent de joie.
--Ah! je ne me plains pas, reprit-il en la serrant fortement contre lui.
Et il couvrit de baisers ce visage délicat qui commençait à perdre la
fraîcheur de la jeunesse, mais dont l'expression était si tendre et si
douce, qu'il ne pouvait jamais le voir sans être consolé.
--Quel silence! dit Ginevra. Mon ami, je trouve un grand plaisir à
veiller. La majesté de la nuit est vraiment contagieuse, elle impose,
elle inspire; il y a je ne sais quelle puissance dans cette idée: tout
dort et je veille.
--O! ma Ginevra, ce n'est pas d'aujourd'hui que je sens combien ton âme
est délicatement gracieuse! Mais voici l'aurore, viens dormir.
--Oui, répondit-elle, si je ne dors pas seule. J'ai bien souffert la
nuit où je me suis aperçue que mon Luigi veillait sans moi!
Le courage avec lequel ces deux jeunes gens combattaient le malheur
reçut pendant quelque temps sa récompense; mais l'événement qui met
presque toujours le comble à la félicité des ménages devait leur être
funeste: Ginevra eut un fils qui, pour se servir d'une expression
populaire, fut _beau comme le jour_. Le sentiment de la maternité doubla
les forces de la jeune femme. Luigi emprunta pour subvenir aux dépenses
des couches de Ginevra. Dans les premiers moments, elle ne sentit donc
pas tout le malaise de sa situation, et les deux époux se livrèrent au
bonheur d'élever un enfant. Ce fut leur dernière félicité. Comme deux
nageurs qui unissent leurs efforts pour rompre un courant, les deux
Corses luttèrent d'abord courageusement; mais parfois ils
s'abandonnaient à une apathie semblable à ces sommeils qui précèdent la
mort, et bientôt ils se virent obligés de vendre leurs bijoux. La
Pauvreté se montra tout à coup, non pas hideuse, mais vêtue simplement,
et presque douce à supporter; sa voix n'avait rien d'effrayant, elle ne
traînait après elle ni désespoir, ni spectres, ni haillons; mais elle
faisait perdre le souvenir et les habitudes de l'aisance; elle usait les
ressorts de l'orgueil. Puis, vint la Misère dans toute son horreur,
insouciante de ses guenilles et foulant aux pieds tous les sentiments
humains. Sept ou huit mois après la naissance du petit Bartholoméo, l'on
aurait eu de la peine à reconnaître dans la mère qui allaitait cet
enfant malingre l'original de l'admirable portrait, le seul ornement
d'une chambre nue. Sans feu par un rude hiver, Ginevra vit les gracieux
contours de sa figure se détruire lentement, ses joues devinrent
blanches comme de la porcelaine. On eût dit que ses yeux avaient pâli.
Elle regardait en pleurant son enfant amaigri, décoloré, et ne souffrait
que de cette jeune misère. Luigi, debout et silencieux, n'avait plus le
courage de sourire à son fils.
--J'ai couru tout Paris, disait-il d'une voix sourde, je n'y connais
personne, et comment oser demander à des indifférents? Vergniaud, le
nourrisseur, mon vieil Égyptien, est impliqué dans une conspiration, il
a été mis en prison, et d'ailleurs, il m'a prêté tout ce dont il pouvait
disposer. Quant à notre propriétaire, il ne nous a rien demandé depuis
un an.
--Mais nous n'avons besoin de rien, répondit doucement Ginevra en
affectant un air calme.
--Chaque jour qui arrive amène une difficulté de plus, reprit Luigi avec
terreur.
La faim était à leur porte. Luigi prit tous les tableaux de Ginevra, le
portrait, plusieurs meubles desquels le ménage pouvait encore se passer,
il vendit tout à vil prix, et la somme qu'il en obtint prolongea
l'agonie du ménage pendant quelques moments. Dans ces jours de malheur,
Ginevra montra la sublimité de son caractère et l'étendue de sa
résignation, elle supporta stoïquement les atteintes de la douleur; son
âme énergique la soutenait contre tous les maux, elle travaillait d'une
main défaillante auprès de son fils mourant, expédiait les soins du
ménage avec une activité miraculeuse, et suffisait à tout. Elle était
même heureuse encore quand elle voyait sur les lèvres de Luigi un
sourire d'étonnement à l'aspect de la propreté qu'elle faisait régner
dans l'unique chambre où ils s'étaient réfugiés.
--Mon ami, je t'ai gardé ce morceau de pain, lui dit-elle un soir qu'il
rentrait fatigué.
--Et toi?
--Moi, j'ai dîné, cher Luigi, je n'ai besoin de rien.
Et la douce expression de son visage le pressait encore plus que sa
parole d'accepter une nourriture de laquelle elle se privait, Luigi
l'embrassa par un de ces baisers de désespoir qui se donnaient en 1793
entre amis à l'heure où ils montaient ensemble à l'échafaud. En ces
moments suprêmes, deux êtres se voient coeur à coeur. Aussi, le
malheureux Luigi comprenant tout à coup que sa femme était à jeun,
partagea-t-il la fièvre qui la dévorait, il frissonna, sortit en
prétextant une affaire pressante, car il aurait mieux aimé prendre le
poison le plus subtil, plutôt que d'éviter la mort en mangeant le
dernier morceau de pain qui se trouvait chez lui. Il se mit à errer dans
Paris au milieu des voitures les plus brillantes, au sein de ce luxe
insultant qui éclate partout; il passa promptement devant les boutiques
des changeurs où l'or étincelle; enfin, il résolut de se vendre, de
s'offrir comme remplaçant pour le service militaire en espérant que ce
sacrifice sauverait Ginevra, et que, pendant son absence, elle pourrait
rentrer en grâce auprès de Bartholoméo. Il alla donc trouver un de ces
hommes qui font la traite des blancs, et il éprouva une sorte de bonheur
à reconnaître en lui un ancien officier de la garde impériale.
--Il y a deux jours que je n'ai mangé, lui dit-il d'une voix lente et
faible, ma femme meurt de faim, et ne m'adresse pas une plainte, elle
expirerait en souriant, je crois. De grâce, mon camarade, ajouta-t-il
avec un sourire amer, achète-moi d'avance, je suis robuste, je ne suis
plus au service, et je...
L'officier donna une somme à Luigi en à-compte sur celle qu'il
s'engageait à lui procurer. L'infortuné poussa un rire convulsif quand
il tint une poignée de pièces d'or, il courut de toute sa force vers sa
maison, haletant, et criant parfois:--O ma Ginevra! Ginevra! Il
commençait à faire nuit quand il arriva chez lui. Il entra tout
doucement, craignant de donner une trop forte émotion à sa femme, qu'il
avait laissée faible. Les derniers rayons du soleil pénétrant par la
lucarne venaient mourir sur le visage de Ginevra qui dormait assise sur
une chaise en tenant son enfant sur son sein.
--Réveille-toi, ma chère Ginevra, dit-il sans s'apercevoir de la pose de
son enfant qui en ce moment conservait un éclat surnaturel.
En entendant cette voix, la pauvre mère ouvrit les yeux, rencontra le
regard de Luigi, et sourit; mais Luigi jeta un cri d'épouvante: Ginevra
était tout à fait changée, à peine la reconnaissait-il, il lui montra
par un geste d'une sauvage énergie l'or qu'il avait à la main.
La jeune femme se mit à rire machinalement, et tout à coup elle s'écria
d'une voix affreuse:--Louis! l'enfant est froid.
Elle regarda son fils et s'évanouit, car le petit Barthélemy était mort.
Luigi prit sa femme dans ses bras sans lui ôter l'enfant qu'elle serrait
avec une force incompréhensible; et après l'avoir posée sur le lit, il
sortit pour appeler au secours.
--O mon Dieu! dit-il à son propriétaire qu'il rencontra sur l'escalier,
j'ai de l'or, et mon enfant est mort de faim, sa mère se meurt,
aidez-nous!
Il revint comme un désespéré vers Ginevra, et laissa l'honnête maçon
occupé, ainsi que plusieurs voisins, de rassembler tout ce qui pouvait
soulager une misère inconnue jusqu'alors, tant les deux Corses l'avaient
soigneusement cachée par un sentiment d'orgueil. Luigi avait jeté son or
sur le plancher, et s'était agenouillé au chevet du lit où gisait sa
femme.
--Mon père! s'écriait Ginevra dans son délire, prenez soin de mon fils
qui porte votre nom.
--O mon ange! calme-toi, lui disait Luigi en l'embrassant, de beaux
jours nous attendent.
Cette voix et cette caresse lui rendirent quelque tranquillité.
--O mon Louis! reprit-elle en le regardant avec une attention
extraordinaire, écoute-moi bien. Je sens que je meurs. Ma mort est
naturelle, je souffrais trop, et puis un bonheur aussi grand que le mien
devait se payer. Oui, mon Luigi, console-toi. J'ai été si heureuse, que
si je recommençais à vivre, j'accepterais encore notre destinée. Je suis
une mauvaise mère: je te regrette encore plus que je ne regrette mon
enfant.--Mon enfant, ajouta-t-elle d'un son de voix profond. Deux larmes
se détachèrent de ses yeux mourants, et soudain elle pressa le cadavre
qu'elle n'avait pu réchauffer.--Donne ma chevelure à mon père, en
souvenir de sa Ginevra, reprit-elle. Dis-lui bien que je ne l'ai jamais
accusé... Sa tête tomba sur le bras de son époux.
--Non, tu ne peux pas mourir, s'écria Luigi, le médecin va venir. Nous
avons du pain. Ton père va te recevoir en grâce. La prospérité s'est
levée pour nous. Reste avec nous, ange de beauté!
Mais ce coeur fidèle et plein d'amour devenait froid, Ginevra tournait
instinctivement les yeux vers celui qu'elle adorait, quoiqu'elle ne fût
plus sensible à rien: des images confuses s'offraient à son esprit, près
de perdre tout souvenir de la terre. Elle savait que Luigi était là, car
elle serrait toujours plus fortement sa main glacée, et semblait vouloir
se retenir au-dessus d'un précipice où elle croyait tomber.
--Mon ami, dit-elle enfin, tu as froid, je vais te réchauffer.
Elle voulut mettre la main de son mari sur son coeur, mais elle expira.
Deux médecins, un prêtre, des voisins entrèrent en ce moment en
apportant tout ce qui était nécessaire pour sauver les deux époux et
calmer leur désespoir. Ces étrangers firent beaucoup de bruit d'abord;
mais quand ils furent entrés, un affreux silence régna dans cette
chambre.
Pendant que cette scène avait lieu, Bartholoméo et sa femme étaient
assis dans leurs fauteuils antiques, chacun à un coin de la vaste
cheminée dont l'ardent brasier réchauffait à peine l'immense salon de
leur hôtel. La pendule marquait minuit. Depuis longtemps le vieux couple
avait perdu le sommeil. En ce moment, ils étaient silencieux comme deux
vieillards tombés en enfance et qui regardent tout sans rien voir. Leur
salon désert, mais plein de souvenirs pour eux, était faiblement éclairé
par une seule lampe près de mourir. Sans les flammes pétillantes du
foyer, ils eussent été dans une obscurité complète. Un de leurs amis
venait de les quitter, et la chaise sur laquelle il s'était assis
pendant sa visite se trouvait entre les deux Corses. Piombo avait déjà
jeté plus d'un regard sur cette chaise, et ces regards pleins d'idées se
succédaient comme des remords, car la chaise vide était celle de
Ginevra. Élisa Piombo épiait les expressions qui passaient sur la
blanche figure de son mari. Quoiqu'elle fût habituée à deviner les
sentiments du Corse, d'après les changeantes révolutions de ses traits,
ils étaient tour à tour si menaçants et si mélancoliques, qu'elle ne
pouvait plus lire dans cette âme incompréhensible.
Bartholoméo succombait-il sous les puissants souvenirs que réveillait
cette chaise? était-il choqué de voir qu'elle venait de servir pour la
première fois à un étranger depuis le départ de sa fille? l'heure de sa
clémence, cette heure si vainement attendue jusqu'alors, avait-elle
sonné?
Ces réflexions agitèrent successivement le coeur d'Élisa Piombo. Pendant
un instant la physionomie de son mari devint si terrible, qu'elle
trembla d'avoir osé employer une ruse si simple pour faire naître
l'occasion de parler de Ginevra. En ce moment, la bise chassa si
violemment les flocons de neige sur les persiennes, que les deux
vieillards purent en entendre le léger bruissement. La mère de Ginevra
baissa la tête pour dérober ses larmes à son mari. Tout à coup un soupir
sortit de la poitrine du vieillard, sa femme le regarda, il était
abattu; elle hasarda pour la seconde fois, depuis trois ans, à lui
parler de sa fille.
--Si Ginevra avait froid, s'écria-t-elle doucement. Piombo
tressaillit.--Elle a peut-être faim, dit-elle en continuant. Le Corse
laissa échapper une larme.--Elle a un enfant, et ne peut pas le nourrir,
son lait s'est tari, reprit vivement la mère avec l'accent du désespoir.
--Qu'elle vienne! qu'elle vienne, s'écria Piombo. O mon enfant chéri! tu
m'as vaincu.
La mère se leva comme pour aller chercher sa fille. En ce moment, la
porte s'ouvrit avec fracas, et un homme dont le visage n'avait plus rien
d'humain surgit tout à coup devant eux.
--_Morte!_ Nos deux familles devaient s'exterminer l'une par l'autre,
car voilà tout ce qui reste d'elle, dit-il en posant sur une table la
longue chevelure noire de Ginevra.
Les deux vieillards frissonnèrent comme s'ils eussent reçu une commotion
de la foudre, et ne virent plus Luigi.
--Il nous épargne un coup de feu, car il est mort, s'écria lentement
Bartholoméo en regardant à terre.
  Paris, janvier 1830.
MADAME FIRMIANI.
  CHER ALEXANDRE DE BERNY.
  Son vieil ami,
  DE BALZAC.
Beaucoup de récits, riches de situations ou rendus dramatiques par les
innombrables jets du hasard, emportent avec eux leurs propres artifices
et peuvent être racontés artistement ou simplement par toutes les
lèvres, sans que le sujet y perde la plus légère de ses beautés; mais il
est quelques aventures de la vie humaine auxquelles les accents du coeur
seuls rendent la vie, il est certains détails pour ainsi dire
anatomiques dont les fibres déliées ne reparaissent dans une action
éteinte que sous les infusions les plus habiles de la pensée; puis, il
est des portraits qui veulent une âme et ne sont rien sans les traits
les plus délicats de leur physionomie mobile; enfin, il se rencontre de
ces choses que nous ne savons dire ou faire sans je ne sais quelles
harmonies inconnues auxquelles président un jour, une heure, une
conjonction heureuse dans les signes célestes ou de secrètes
prédispositions morales. Ces sortes de révélations mystérieuses étaient
impérieusement exigées pour dire cette histoire simple à laquelle on
voudrait pouvoir intéresser quelques-unes de ces âmes naturellement
mélancoliques et songeuses qui se nourrissent d'émotions douces. Si
l'écrivain, semblable à un chirurgien près d'un ami mourant, s'est
pénétré d'une espèce de respect pour le sujet qu'il maniait, pourquoi le
lecteur ne partagerait-il pas ce sentiment inexplicable? Est-ce une
chose difficile que de s'initier à cette vague et nerveuse tristesse
qui, n'ayant point d'aliment, répand des teintes grises autour de nous,
demi-maladie dont les molles souffrances plaisent parfois? Si vous
pensez par hasard aux personnes chères que vous avez perdues; si vous
êtes seul, s'il est nuit ou si le jour tombe, poursuivez la lecture de
cette histoire; autrement, vous jetteriez le livre, ici. Si vous n'avez
pas enseveli déjà quelque bonne tante infirme ou sans fortune, vous ne
comprendrez point ces pages. Aux uns, elles sembleront imprégnées de
musc; aux autres, elles paraîtront aussi décolorées, aussi vertueuses
que peuvent l'être celles de Florian. Pour tout dire, le lecteur doit
avoir connu la volupté des larmes, avoir senti la douleur muette d'un
souvenir qui passe légèrement, chargé d'une ombre chère, mais d'une
ombre lointaine; il doit posséder quelques-uns de ces souvenirs qui font
tout à la fois regretter ce que vous a dévoré la terre, et sourire d'un
bonheur évanoui. Maintenant, croyez que, pour les richesses de
l'Angleterre, l'auteur ne voudrait pas extorquer à la poésie un seul de
ses mensonges pour embellir sa narration. Ceci est une histoire vraie et
pour laquelle vous pouvez dépenser les trésors de votre sensibilité, si
vous en avez.
Aujourd'hui, notre langue a autant d'idiomes qu'il existe de Variétés
d'hommes dans la grande famille française. Aussi est-ce vraiment chose
curieuse et agréable que d'écouter les différentes acceptions ou
versions données sur une même chose ou sur un même événement par chacune
des Espèces qui composent la monographie du Parisien, le Parisien étant
pris pour généraliser la thèse.
Ainsi, vous eussiez demandé à un sujet appartenant au genre des
Positifs:--Connaissez-vous madame Firmiani? cet homme vous eût traduit
madame Firmiani par l'inventaire suivant:--Un grand hôtel situé rue du
Bac, des salons bien meublés, de beaux tableaux, cent bonnes mille
livres de rente, et un mari, jadis receveur-général dans le département
de Montenotte. Ayant dit, le Positif, homme gros et rond, presque
toujours vêtu de noir, fait une petite grimace de satisfaction, relève
sa lèvre inférieure en la fronçant de manière à couvrir la supérieure,
et hoche la tête comme s'il ajoutait: Voilà des gens solides et sur
lesquels il n'y a rien à dire. Ne lui demandez rien de plus! Les
Positifs expliquent tout par des chiffres, par des rentes ou par les
biens au soleil, un mot de leur lexique.
Tournez à droite, allez interroger cet autre qui appartient au genre des
Flâneurs, répétez-lui votre question:--Madame Firmiani? dit-il, oui,
oui, je la connais bien, je vais à ses soirées. Elle reçoit le mercredi;
c'est une maison fort honorable. Déjà, madame Firmiani se métamorphose
en maison. Cette maison n'est plus un amas de pierres superposées
architectoniquement; non, ce mot est, dans la langue des Flâneurs, un
idiotisme intraduisible. Ici, le Flâneur, homme sec, à sourire agréable,
disant de jolis riens, ayant toujours plus d'esprit acquis que d'esprit
naturel, se penche à votre oreille, et d'un air fin, vous dit:--Je n'ai
jamais vu monsieur Firmiani. Sa position sociale consiste à gérer des
biens en Italie; mais madame Firmiani est Française, et dépense ses
revenus en Parisienne. Elle a d'excellent thé! C'est une des maisons
aujourd'hui si rares où l'on s'amuse et où ce que l'on vous donne est
exquis. Il est d'ailleurs fort difficile d'être admis chez elle. Aussi
la meilleure société se trouve-t-elle dans ses salons! Puis, le Flâneur
commente ce dernier mot par une prise de tabac saisie gravement; il se
garnit le nez à petits coups, et semble vous dire:--Je vais dans cette
maison, mais ne comptez pas sur moi pour vous y présenter.
Madame Firmiani tient pour les Flâneurs une espèce d'auberge sans
enseigne.
--Que veux-tu donc aller faire chez madame Firmiani? mais l'on s'y
ennuie autant qu'à la cour. A quoi sert d'avoir de l'esprit, si ce n'est
à éviter des salons où, par la poésie qui court, on lit la plus petite
ballade fraîchement éclose?
Vous avez questionné l'un de vos amis classé parmi les Personnels, gens
qui voudraient tenir l'univers sous clef et n'y rien laisser faire sans
leur permission. Ils sont malheureux de tout le bonheur des autres, ne
pardonnent qu'aux vices, aux chutes, aux infirmités, et ne veulent que
des protégés. Aristocrates par inclination, ils se font républicains par
dépit, uniquement pour trouver beaucoup d'inférieurs parmi leurs égaux.
--Oh! madame Firmiani, mon cher, est une de ces femmes adorables qui
servent d'excuse à la nature pour toutes les laides qu'elle a créées par
erreur; elle est ravissante! elle est bonne! Je ne voudrais être au
pouvoir, devenir roi, posséder des millions, que pour (_ici trois mots
dits à l'oreille_). Veux-tu que je t'y présente?...
Ce jeune homme est du genre Lycéen connu pour sa grande hardiesse entre
hommes et sa grande timidité à huis-clos.
--Madame Firmiani? s'écrie un autre en faisant tourner sa canne sur
elle-même, je vais te dire ce que j'en pense: c'est une femme entre
trente et trente-cinq ans, figure passée, beaux yeux, taille plate, voix
de contr'alto usée, beaucoup de toilette, un peu de rouge, charmantes
manières; enfin, mon cher, les restes d'une jolie femme qui néanmoins
valent encore la peine d'une passion.
Cette sentence est due à un sujet du genre Fat qui vient de déjeuner, ne
pèse plus ses paroles et va monter à cheval. En ces moments, les Fats
sont impitoyables.
--Il y a chez elle une galerie de tableaux magnifiques, allez la voir!
vous répond un autre. Rien n'est si beau!
Vous vous êtes adressé au genre Amateur. L'individu vous quitte pour
aller chez Pérignon ou chez Tripet. Pour lui, madame Firmiani est une
collection de toiles peintes.
UNE FEMME.--Madame Firmiani? Je ne veux pas que vous alliez chez elle.
Cette phrase est la plus riche des traductions. Madame Firmiani! femme
dangereuse! une sirène! elle se met bien, elle a du goût, elle cause des
insomnies à toutes les femmes. L'interlocutrice appartient au genre des
Tracassiers.
UN ATTACHÉ D'AMBASSADE.--Madame Firmiani! N'est-elle pas d'Anvers? J'ai
vu cette femme-là bien belle il y a dix ans. Elle était alors à Rome.
Les sujets appartenant à la classe des Attachés ont la manie de dire des
mots à la Talleyrand, leur esprit est souvent si fin, que leurs aperçus
sont imperceptibles; ils ressemblent à ces joueurs de billard qui
évitent les billes avec une adresse infinie. Ces individus sont
généralement peu parleurs; mais quand ils parlent, ils ne s'occupent que
de l'Espagne, de Vienne, de l'Italie ou de Pétersbourg. Les noms de pays
sont chez eux comme des ressorts; pressez-les, la sonnerie vous dira
tous ses airs.
--Cette madame Firmiani ne voit-elle pas beaucoup le faubourg
Saint-Germain? Ceci est dit par une personne qui veut appartenir au
genre Distingué. Elle donne le _de_ à tout le monde, à monsieur Dupin
l'aîné, à monsieur Lafayette; elle le jette à tort et à travers, elle en
déshonore les gens. Elle passe sa vie à s'inquiéter de ce qui est
_bien_; mais, pour son supplice, elle demeure au Marais, et son mari a
été avoué, mais avoué à la Cour royale.
--Madame Firmiani, monsieur? je ne la connais pas. Cet homme appartient
au genre des Ducs. Il n'avoue que les femmes présentées. Excusez-le, il
a été fait duc par Napoléon.
--Madame Firmiani? N'est-ce pas une ancienne actrice des Italiens? Homme
du genre Niais. Les individus de cette classe veulent avoir réponse à
tout. Ils calomnient plutôt que de se taire.
DEUX VIEILLES DAMES (_femmes d'anciens magistrats_). LA PREMIÈRE. (Elle
a un bonnet à coques, sa figure est ridée, son nez est pointu, elle
tient un Paroissien, voix dure.)--Qu'est-elle en son nom, cette madame
Firmiani? LA SECONDE. (Petite figure rouge ressemblant à une vieille
pomme d'api, voix douce.)--Une Cadignan, ma chère, nièce du vieux prince
de Cadignan et cousine par conséquent du duc de Maufrigneuse.
Madame Firmiani est une Cadignan. Elle n'aurait ni vertus, ni fortune,
ni jeunesse, ce serait toujours une Cadignan. Une Cadignan, c'est comme
un préjugé, toujours riche et vivant.
UN ORIGINAL.--Mon cher, je n'ai jamais vu de socques dans son
antichambre, tu peux aller chez elle sans te compromettre et y jouer
sans crainte, parce que, s'il y a des fripons, ils sont gens de qualité;
partant, on ne s'y querelle pas.
VIEILLARD APPARTENANT AU GENRE DES OBSERVATEURS.--Vous irez chez madame
Firmiani, vous trouverez, mon cher, une belle femme nonchalamment assise
au coin de sa cheminée. A peine se lèvera-t-elle de son fauteuil, elle
ne le quitte que pour les femmes ou les ambassadeurs, les ducs, les gens
considérables. Elle est fort gracieuse, elle charme, elle cause bien et
veut causer de tout. Il y a chez elle tous les indices de la passion,
mais on lui donne trop d'adorateurs pour qu'elle ait un favori. Si les
soupçons ne planaient que sur deux ou trois de ses intimes, nous
saurions quel est son cavalier servant; mais c'est une femme tout
mystère: elle est mariée, et jamais nous n'avons vu son mari; monsieur
Firmiani est un personnage tout à fait fantastique, il ressemble à ce
troisième cheval que l'on paie toujours en courant la poste et qu'on
n'aperçoit jamais; madame, à entendre les artistes, est le premier
contr'alto d'Europe et n'a pas chanté trois fois depuis qu'elle est à
Paris; elle reçoit beaucoup de monde et ne va chez personne.
L'Observateur parle en prophète. Il faut accepter ses paroles, ses
anecdotes, ses citations comme des vérités, sous peine de passer pour un
homme sans instruction, sans moyens. Il vous calomniera gaiement dans
vingt salons où il est essentiel comme une première pièce sur l'affiche,
ces pièces si souvent jouées pour les banquettes et qui ont eu du succès
autrefois. L'Observateur a quarante ans, ne dîne jamais chez lui, se dit
peu dangereux près des femmes; il est poudré, porte un habit marron, a
toujours une place dans plusieurs loges aux Bouffons; il est quelquefois
confondu parmi les Parasites, mais il a rempli de trop hautes fonctions
pour être soupçonné d'être un pique-assiette et possède d'ailleurs une
terre dans un département dont le nom ne lui est jamais échappé.
--Madame Firmiani? Mais, mon cher, c'est une ancienne maîtresse de
Murat! Celui-ci est dans la classe des Contradicteurs. Ces sortes de
gens font les _errata_ de tous les mémoires, rectifient tous les faits,
parient toujours cent contre un, sont sûrs de tout. Vous les surprenez
dans la même soirée en flagrant délit d'ubiquité: ils disent avoir été
arrêtés à Paris lors de la conspiration Mallet, en oubliant qu'ils
venaient, une demi-heure auparavant, de passer la Bérésina. Presque tous
les Contradicteurs sont chevaliers de la Légion-d'Honneur, parlent
très-haut, ont un front fuyant et jouent gros jeu.
--Madame Firmiani, cent mille livres de rente?... êtes-vous fou!
Vraiment, il y a des gens qui vous donnent des cent mille livres de
rente avec la libéralité des auteurs auxquels cela ne coûte rien quand
ils dotent leurs héroïnes. Mais madame Firmiani est une coquette qui
dernièrement a ruiné un jeune homme et l'a empêché de faire un très-beau
mariage. Si elle n'était pas belle, elle serait sans un sou.
Oh! celui-ci, vous le reconnaissez, il est du genre des Envieux, et nous
n'en dessinerons pas le moindre trait. L'espèce est aussi connue que
peut l'être celle des _felis_ domestiques. Comment expliquer la
perpétuité de l'Envie? un vice qui ne rapporte rien!
Les _gens_ du monde, les _gens_ de lettres, les honnêtes _gens_, et les
_gens_ de tout genre répandaient, au mois de janvier 1824, tant
d'opinions différentes sur madame Firmiani qu'il serait fastidieux de
les consigner toutes ici. Nous avons seulement voulu constater qu'un
homme intéressé à la connaître, sans vouloir ou pouvoir aller chez elle,
aurait eu raison de la croire également veuve ou mariée, sotte ou
spirituelle, vertueuse ou sans moeurs, riche ou pauvre, sensible ou
sans âme, belle ou laide; il y avait enfin autant de madames Firmiani
que de classes dans la société, que de sectes dans le catholicisme.
Effrayante pensée! nous sommes tous comme des planches lithographiques
dont une infinité de copies se tire par la médisance. Ces épreuves
ressemblent au modèle ou en diffèrent par des nuances tellement
imperceptibles que la réputation dépend, sauf les calomnies de nos amis
et les bons mots d'un journal, de la balance faite par chacun entre le
Vrai qui va boitant et le Mensonge à qui l'esprit parisien donne des
ailes.
Madame Firmiani, semblable à beaucoup de femmes pleines de noblesse et
de fierté qui se font de leur coeur un sanctuaire et dédaignent le
monde, aurait pu être très-mal jugée par monsieur de Bourbonne, vieux
propriétaire occupé d'elle pendant l'hiver de cette année. Par hasard ce
propriétaire appartenait à la classe des Planteurs de province, gens
habitués à se rendre compte de tout et à faire des marchés avec les
paysans. A ce métier, un homme devient perspicace malgré lui, comme un
soldat contracte à la longue un courage de routine. Ce curieux, venu de
Touraine, et que les idiomes parisiens ne satisfaisaient guère, était un
gentilhomme très-honorable qui jouissait, pour seul et unique héritier,
d'un neveu pour lequel il plantait ses peupliers. Cette amitié
ultra-naturelle motivait bien des médisances, que les sujets appartenant
aux diverses espèces du Tourangeau formulaient très-spirituellement;
mais il est inutile de les rapporter, elles pâliraient auprès des
médisances parisiennes. Quand un homme peut penser sans déplaisir à son
héritier en voyant tous les jours de belles rangées de peupliers
s'embellir, l'affection s'accroît de chaque coup de bêche qu'il donne au
pied de ses arbres. Quoique ce phénomène de sensibilité soit peu commun,
il se rencontre encore en Touraine.
Ce neveu chéri, qui se nommait Octave de Camps, descendait du fameux
abbé de Camps, si connu des bibliophiles ou des savants, ce qui n'est
pas la même chose. Les gens de province ont la mauvaise habitude de
frapper d'une espèce de réprobation décente les jeunes gens qui vendent
leurs héritages. Ce gothique préjugé nuit à l'agiotage que jusqu'à
présent le gouvernement encourage par nécessité. Sans consulter son
oncle, Octave avait à l'improviste disposé d'une terre en faveur de la
bande noire. Le château de Villaines eût été démoli sans les
propositions que le vieil oncle avait faites aux représentants de la
compagnie du Marteau. Pour augmenter la colère du testateur, un ami
d'Octave, parent éloigné, un de ces cousins à petite fortune et à grande
habileté qui font dire d'eux par les gens prudents de leur province:--Je
ne voudrais pas avoir de procès avec lui! était venu par hasard chez
monsieur de Bourbonne et lui avait appris la ruine de son neveu.
Monsieur Octave de Camps, après avoir dissipé sa fortune pour une
certaine madame Firmiani, était réduit à se faire répétiteur de
mathématiques, en attendant l'héritage de son oncle, auquel il n'osait
venir avouer ses fautes. Cet arrière-cousin, espèce de Charles Moor,
n'avait pas eu honte de donner ces fatales nouvelles au vieux campagnard
au moment où il digérait, devant son large foyer, un copieux dîner de
province. Mais les héritiers ne viennent pas à bout d'un oncle aussi
facilement qu'ils le voudraient. Grâce à son entêtement, celui-ci qui
refusait de croire en l'arrière-cousin, sortit vainqueur de
l'indigestion causée par la biographie de son neveu. Certains coups
portent sur le coeur, d'autres sur la tête: le coup porté par
l'arrière-cousin tomba sur les entrailles et produisit peu d'effet,
parce que le bonhomme avait un excellent estomac. En vrai disciple de
saint Thomas, monsieur de Bourbonne vint à Paris à l'insu d'Octave, et
voulut prendre des renseignements sur la déconfiture de son héritier. Le
vieux gentilhomme, qui avait des relations dans le faubourg
Saint-Germain par les Listomère, les Lenoncourt et les Vandenesse,
entendit tant de médisances, de vérités, de faussetés sur madame
Firmiani qu'il résolut de se faire présenter chez elle sous le nom de
monsieur de Rouxellay, nom de sa terre. Le prudent vieillard avait eu
soin de choisir, pour venir étudier la prétendue maîtresse d'Octave, une
soirée pendant laquelle il le savait occupé d'achever un travail
chèrement payé; car l'ami de madame Firmiani était toujours reçu chez
elle, circonstance que personne ne pouvait expliquer. Quant à la ruine
d'Octave, ce n'était malheureusement pas une fable.
Monsieur de Rouxellay ne ressemblait point à un oncle du Gymnase. Ancien
mousquetaire, homme de haute compagnie qui avait eu jadis des bonnes
fortunes, il savait se présenter courtoisement, se souvenait des
manières polies d'autrefois, disait des mots gracieux et comprenait
presque toute la Charte. Quoiqu'il aimât les Bourbons avec une noble
franchise, qu'il crût en Dieu comme y croient les gentilshommes et qu'il
ne lût que _la Quotidienne_, il n'était pas aussi ridicule que les
libéraux de son département le souhaitaient. Il pouvait tenir sa place
près des gens de cour, pourvu qu'on ne lui parlât point de _Mosè_, ni de
drame, ni de romantisme, ni de couleur locale, ni de chemins de fer. Il
en était resté à monsieur de Voltaire, à monsieur le comte de Buffon, à
Peyronnet et au chevalier Gluck, le musicien du coin de la reine.
--Madame, dit-il à la marquise de Listomère à laquelle il donnait le
bras en entrant chez madame Firmiani, si cette femme est la maîtresse de
mon neveu, je le plains. Comment peut-elle vivre au sein du luxe en le
sachant dans un grenier? Elle n'a donc pas d'âme? Octave est un fou
d'avoir placé le prix de la terre de Villaines dans le coeur d'une...
Monsieur de Bourbonne appartenait au genre Fossile, et ne connaissait
que le langage du vieux temps.
--Mais s'il l'avait perdue au jeu?
--Eh, madame, au moins il aurait eu le plaisir de jouer.
--Vous croyez donc qu'il n'a pas eu de plaisir? Tenez, voyez madame
Firmiani.
Les plus beaux souvenirs du vieil oncle pâlirent à l'aspect de la
prétendue maîtresse de son neveu. Sa colère expira dans une phrase
gracieuse qui lui fut arrachée à l'aspect de madame Firmiani. Par un de
ces hasards qui n'arrivent qu'aux jolies femmes, elle était dans un
moment où toutes ses beautés brillaient d'un éclat particulier, dû
peut-être à la lueur des bougies, à une toilette admirablement simple, à
je ne sais quel reflet de l'élégance au sein de laquelle elle vivait. Il
faut avoir étudié les petites révolutions d'une soirée dans un salon de
Paris pour apprécier les nuances imperceptibles qui peuvent colorer un
visage de femme et le changer. Il est un moment où, contente de sa
parure, où se trouvant spirituelle, heureuse d'être admirée en se voyant
la reine d'un salon plein d'hommes remarquables qui lui sourient, une
Parisienne a la conscience de sa beauté, de sa grâce; elle s'embellit
alors de tous les regards qu'elle recueille et qui l'animent, mais dont
les muets hommages sont reportés par de fins regards au bien-aimé. En ce
moment, une femme est comme investie d'un pouvoir surnaturel et devient
magicienne, coquette à son insu, elle inspire involontairement l'amour
qui l'enivre en secret, elle a des sourires et des regards qui
fascinent. Si cet état, venu de l'âme, donne de l'attrait même aux
laides, de quelle splendeur ne revêt-il pas une femme nativement
élégante, aux formes distinguées, blanche, fraîche, aux yeux vifs, et
surtout mise avec un goût avoué des artistes et de ses plus cruelles
rivales!
Avez-vous, pour votre bonheur, rencontré quelque personne dont la voix
harmonieuse imprime à la parole un charme également répandu dans ses
manières, qui sait et parler et se taire, qui s'occupe de vous avec
délicatesse, dont les mots sont heureusement choisis, ou dont le langage
est pur? Sa raillerie caresse et sa critique ne blesse point. Elle ne
disserte pas plus qu'elle ne dispute, mais elle se plaît à conduire une
discussion, et l'arrête à propos. Son air est affable et riant, sa
politesse n'a rien de forcé, son empressement n'est pas servile; elle
réduit le respect à n'être plus qu'une ombre douce; elle ne vous fatigue
jamais, et vous laisse satisfait d'elle et de vous. Sa bonne grâce, vous
la retrouvez empreinte dans les choses desquelles elle s'environne. Chez
elle, tout flatte la vue, et vous y respirez comme l'air d'une patrie.
Cette femme est naturelle. En elle, jamais d'effort, elle n'affiche
rien, ses sentiments sont simplement rendus, parce qu'ils sont vrais.
Franche, elle sait n'offenser aucun amour-propre; elle accepte les
hommes comme Dieu les a faits, plaignant les gens vicieux, pardonnant
aux défauts et aux ridicules, concevant tous les âges, et ne s'irritant
de rien, parce qu'elle a le tact de tout prévoir. A la fois tendre et
gaie, elle oblige avant de consoler. Vous l'aimez tant, que si cet ange
fait une faute, vous vous sentez prêt à la justifier. Telle était madame
Firmiani.
Lorsque le vieux Bourbonne eut causé pendant un quart d'heure avec cette
femme, assis près d'elle, son neveu fut absous. Il comprit que, fausses
ou vraies, les liaisons d'Octave et de madame Firmiani cachaient sans
doute quelque mystère. Revenant aux illusions qui dorent les premiers
jours de notre jeunesse, et jugeant du coeur de madame Firmiani par sa
beauté, le vieux gentilhomme pensa qu'une femme aussi pénétrée de sa
dignité qu'elle paraissait l'être était incapable d'une mauvaise action.
Ses yeux noirs annonçaient tant de calme intérieur, les lignes de son
visage étaient si nobles, les contours si purs, et la passion dont on
l'accusait semblait lui peser si peu sur le coeur, que le vieillard se
dit en admirant toutes les promesses faites à l'amour et à la vertu par
cette adorable physionomie:--Mon neveu aura commis quelque sottise.
Madame Firmiani avouait vingt-cinq ans. Mais les Positifs prouvaient
que, mariée en 1813, à l'âge de seize ans, elle devait avoir au moins
vingt-huit ans en 1825. Néanmoins, les mêmes gens assuraient aussi qu'à
aucune époque de sa vie elle n'avait été si désirable, ni si
complétement femme. Elle était sans enfants, et n'en avait point eu; le
problématique Firmiani, quadragénaire très-respectable en 1813, n'avait
pu, disait-on, lui offrir que son nom et sa fortune. Madame Firmiani
atteignait donc à l'âge où la Parisienne conçoit le mieux une passion,
et la désire peut-être innocemment à ses heures perdues; elle avait
acquis tout ce que le monde vend, tout ce qu'il prête, tout ce qu'il
donne; les Attachés d'ambassade prétendaient qu'elle n'ignorait rien,
les Contradicteurs prétendaient qu'elle pouvait encore apprendre
beaucoup de choses, les Observateurs lui trouvaient les mains bien
blanches, le pied bien mignon, les mouvements un peu trop onduleux; mais
les individus de tous les Genres enviaient ou contestaient le bonheur
d'Octave en convenant qu'elle était la femme le plus aristocratiquement
belle de tout Paris. Jeune encore, riche, musicienne parfaite,
spirituelle, délicate, reçue, en souvenir des Cadignan auxquels elle
appartenait par sa mère, chez madame la princesse de Blamont-Chauvry,
l'oracle du noble faubourg, aimée de ses rivales la duchesse de
Maufrigneuse sa cousine, la marquise d'Espard, et madame de Macumer,
elle flattait toutes les vanités qui alimentent ou qui excitent l'amour.
Aussi était-elle désirée par trop de gens pour n'être pas victime de
l'élégante médisance parisienne et des ravissantes calomnies qui se
débitent si spirituellement sous l'éventail ou dans les _à parte_. Les
observations par lesquelles cette histoire commence étaient donc
nécessaires pour faire connaître la Firmiani du monde. Si quelques
femmes lui pardonnaient son bonheur, d'autres ne lui faisaient pas grâce
de sa décence; or, rien n'est terrible, surtout à Paris, comme des
soupçons sans fondement: il est impossible de les détruire. Cette
esquisse d'une figure admirable de naturel n'en donnera jamais qu'une
faible idée: il faudrait le pinceau des Ingres pour rendre la fierté du
front, la profusion des cheveux, la majesté du regard, toutes les
pensées que faisaient supposer les couleurs particulières du teint. Il y
avait tout dans cette femme: les poëtes pouvaient en faire à la fois
Jeanne d'Arc ou Agnès Sorel; mais il s'y trouvait aussi la femme
inconnue, l'âme cachée sous cette enveloppe décevante, l'âme d'Ève, les
richesses du mal et les trésors du bien, la faute et la résignation, le
crime et le dévouement, Dona Julia et Haïdée du _Don Juan_ de lord
Byron.
L'ancien mousquetaire demeura fort impertinemment le dernier dans le
salon de madame Firmiani, qui le trouva tranquillement assis dans un
fauteuil, et restant devant elle avec l'importunité d'une mouche qu'il
faut tuer pour s'en débarrasser. La pendule marquait deux heures après
minuit.
--Madame, dit le vieux gentilhomme au moment où madame Firmiani se leva
en espérant faire comprendre à son hôte que son bon plaisir était qu'il
partît, madame, je suis l'oncle de monsieur Octave de Camps.
Madame Firmiani s'assit promptement et laissa voir son émotion. Malgré
sa perspicacité, le planteur de peupliers ne devina pas si elle
pâlissait et rougissait de honte ou de plaisir. Il est des plaisirs qui
ne vont pas sans un peu de pudeur effarouchée, délicieuses émotions que
le coeur le plus chaste voudrait toujours voiler. Plus une femme est
délicate, plus elle veut cacher les joies de son âme. Beaucoup de
femmes, inconcevables dans leurs divins caprices, souhaitent souvent
entendre prononcer par tout le monde un nom que parfois elles
désireraient ensevelir dans leur coeur. Le vieux Bourbonne n'interpréta
pas tout à fait ainsi le trouble de madame Firmiani; mais pardonnez-lui,
le campagnard était défiant.
--Eh bien, monsieur? lui dit madame Firmiani en lui jetant un de ces
regards lucides et clairs où nous autres hommes nous ne pouvons jamais
rien voir parce qu'ils nous interrogent un peu trop.
--Eh! bien, madame, reprit le gentilhomme, savez-vous ce qu'on est venu
me dire, à moi, au fond de ma province? Mon neveu se serait ruiné pour
vous, et le malheureux est dans un grenier tandis que vous vivez ici
dans l'or et la soie. Vous me pardonnerez ma rustique franchise, car il
est peut-être très-utile que vous soyez instruite des calomnies...
--Arrêtez, monsieur, dit madame Firmiani en interrompant le gentilhomme
par un geste impératif, je sais tout cela. Vous êtes trop poli pour
laisser la conversation sur ce sujet lorsque je vous aurai prié de
quitter. Vous êtes trop galant (dans l'ancienne acception du mot,
ajouta-t-elle en donnant un léger accent d'ironie à ses paroles) pour ne
pas reconnaître que vous n'avez aucun droit à me questionner. Enfin, il
est ridicule à moi de me justifier. J'espère que vous aurez une assez
bonne opinion de mon caractère pour croire au profond mépris que
l'argent m'inspire, quoique j'aie été mariée sans aucune espèce de
fortune à un homme qui avait une immense fortune. J'ignore si monsieur
votre neveu est riche ou pauvre; si je l'ai reçu, si je le reçois, je le
regarde comme digne d'être au milieu de mes amis. Tous mes amis,
monsieur, ont du respect les uns pour les autres: ils savent que je n'ai
pas la philosophie de voir les gens quand je ne les estime point;
peut-être est-ce manquer de charité; mais mon ange gardien m'a maintenue
jusqu'aujourd'hui dans une aversion profonde et des caquets et de
l'improbité.
Quoique le timbre de la voix fût légèrement altéré pendant les premières
phrases de cette réplique, les derniers mots en furent dits par madame
Firmiani avec l'aplomb de Célimène raillant le Misanthrope.
--Madame, reprit le comte d'une voix émue, je suis un vieillard, je suis
presque le père d'Octave, je vous demande donc, par avance, le plus
humble des pardons pour la seule question que je vais avoir la hardiesse
de vous adresser, et je vous donne ma parole de loyal gentilhomme que
votre réponse mourra là, dit-il en mettant la main sur son coeur avec un
mouvement véritablement religieux. La médisance a-t-elle raison,
aimez-vous Octave?
--Monsieur, dit-elle, à tout autre je ne répondrais que par un regard;
mais à vous, et parce que vous êtes presque le père de monsieur de
Camps, je vous demanderai ce que vous penseriez d'une femme si, à votre
question, elle disait: _oui_. Avouer son amour à celui que nous aimons,
quand il nous aime... là... bien; quand nous sommes certaines d'être
toujours aimées, croyez-moi, monsieur, c'est un effort, une récompense,
un bonheur; mais à un autre!...
Madame Firmiani n'acheva pas, elle se leva, salua le bonhomme et
disparut dans ses appartements, dont toutes les portes successivement
ouvertes et fermées eurent un langage pour les oreilles du planteur de
peupliers.
--Ah! peste, se dit le vieillard, quelle femme! c'est ou une rusée
commère ou un ange. Et il gagna sa voiture de remise, dont les chevaux
donnaient de temps en temps des coups de pied au pavé de la cour
silencieuse. Le cocher dormait, après avoir cent fois maudit sa
pratique.
Le lendemain matin, vers huit heures, le vieux gentilhomme montait
l'escalier d'une maison située rue de l'Observance où demeurait Octave
de Camps. S'il y eut au monde un homme étonné, ce fut certes le jeune
professeur en voyant son oncle: la clef était sur la porte, la lampe
d'Octave brûlait encore, il avait passé la nuit.
--Monsieur le drôle, dit monsieur de Bourbonne en s'asseyant sur un
fauteuil, depuis quand se rit-on (style chaste) des oncles qui ont
vingt-six mille livres de rente en bonnes terres de Touraine, lorsqu'on
est leur seul héritier? Savez-vous que jadis nous respections ces
parents-là? Voyons, as-tu quelques reproches à m'adresser? ai-je mal
fait mon métier d'oncle, t'ai-je demandé du respect, t'ai-je refusé de
l'argent, t'ai-je fermé la porte au nez en prétendant que tu venais voir
comment je me portais; n'as-tu pas l'oncle le plus commode, le moins
assujettissant qu'il y ait en France? je ne dis pas en Europe, ce serait
trop prétentieux. Tu m'écris ou tu ne m'écris pas, je vis sur
l'affection jurée, et t'arrange la plus jolie terre du pays, un bien qui
fait l'envie de tout le département; mais je ne veux te la laisser
néanmoins que le plus tard possible. Cette velléité n'est-elle pas
excessivement excusable? Et monsieur vend son bien, se loge comme un
laquais, et n'a plus ni gens ni train...
--Mon oncle...
--Il ne s'agit pas de l'oncle, mais du neveu. J'ai droit à ta confiance:
ainsi confesse-toi promptement, c'est plus facile, je sais cela par
expérience. As-tu joué, as-tu perdu à la Bourse? Allons, dis-moi: «Mon
oncle, je suis un misérable!» et je t'embrasse. Mais si tu me fais un
mensonge plus gros que ceux que j'ai faits à ton âge, je vends mon bien,
je le mets en viager, et reprendrai mes mauvaises habitudes de jeunesse,
si c'est encore possible.
--Mon oncle...
--J'ai vu hier ta madame Firmiani, dit l'oncle en baisant le bout de ses
doigts qu'il ramassa en faisceau. Elle est charmante, ajouta-t-il. Tu as
l'approbation et le privilége du roi, et l'agrément de ton oncle, si
cela peut te faire plaisir. Quant à la sanction de l'Église, elle est
inutile, je crois, les sacrements sont sans doute trop chers! Allons,
parle, est-ce pour elle que tu t'es ruiné?
--Oui, mon oncle.
--Ah! la coquine, je l'aurais parié. De mon temps, les femmes de la cour
étaient plus habiles à ruiner un homme que ne peuvent l'être vos
courtisanes d'aujourd'hui. J'ai reconnu, en elle, le siècle passé
rajeuni.
--Mon oncle, reprit Octave d'un air tout à la fois triste et doux, vous
vous méprenez: madame Firmiani mérite votre estime et toutes les
adorations de ses admirateurs.
--La pauvre jeunesse sera donc toujours la même, dit monsieur de
Bourbonne. Allons; va ton train, rabâche-moi de vieilles histoires.
Cependant tu dois savoir que je ne suis pas d'hier dans la galanterie.
--Mon bon oncle, voici une lettre qui vous dira tout, répondit Octave en
tirant un élégant portefeuille, donné sans doute par _elle_; quand vous
l'aurez lue, j'achèverai de vous instruire, et vous connaîtrez une
madame Firmiani inconnue au monde.
--Je n'ai pas mes lunettes, dit l'oncle, lis-la moi.
Octave commença ainsi: «Mon ami chéri...
--Tu es donc bien lié avec cette femme-là?
--Mais, oui, mon oncle.
--Et vous n'êtes pas brouillés?
--Brouillés!... répéta Octave tout étonné. Nous sommes mariés à
Greatna-Green.
--Hé bien, reprit monsieur de Bourbonne, pourquoi dînes-tu donc à
quarante sous?
--Laissez-moi continuer.
--C'est juste, j'écoute.
Octave reprit la lettre, et n'en lut pas certains passages sans de
profondes émotions.
  «Mon époux aimé, tu m'as demandé raison de ma tristesse; a-t-elle donc
  passé de mon âme sur mon visage, ou l'as-tu seulement devinée? et
  pourquoi n'en serait-il pas ainsi? nous sommes si bien unis de coeur!
  D'ailleurs, je ne sais pas mentir, et peut-être est-ce un malheur? Une
  des conditions de la femme aimée est d'être toujours caressante et
  gaie. Peut-être devrais-je te tromper; mais je ne le voudrais pas,
  quand même il s'agirait d'augmenter ou de conserver le bonheur que tu
  me donnes, que tu me prodigues, dont tu m'accables. Oh! cher, combien
  de reconnaissance comporte mon amour! Aussi veux-je t'aimer toujours,
  sans bornes. Oui, je veux toujours être fière de toi. Notre gloire, à
  nous, est toute dans celui que nous aimons. Estime, considération,
  honneur, tout n'est-il pas à celui qui a tout pris! Eh bien! mon ange
  a failli. Oui, cher, ta dernière confidence a terni ma félicité
  passée. Depuis ce moment, je me trouve humiliée en toi; en toi que je
  regardais comme le plus pur des hommes, comme tu en es le plus aimant
  et le plus tendre. Il faut avoir bien confiance en ton coeur, encore
  enfant, pour te faire un aveu qui me coûte horriblement. Comment,
  pauvre ange, ton père a dérobé sa fortune, tu le sais, et tu la
  gardes! Et tu m'as conté ce haut fait de procureur dans une chambre
  pleine de muets témoins de notre amour, et tu es gentilhomme, et tu te
  crois noble, et tu me possèdes, et tu as vingt-deux ans! Combien de
  monstruosités! Je t'ai cherché des excuses. J'ai attribué ton
  insouciance à ta jeunesse étourdie. Je sais qu'il y a beaucoup de
  l'enfant en toi. Peut-être n'as-tu pas encore pensé bien sérieusement
  à ce qui est fortune et probité. Oh! combien ton rire m'a fait de mal!
  Songe donc qu'il existe une famille ruinée, toujours en larmes, des
  jeunes personnes qui peut-être te maudissent tous les jours, un
  vieillard qui chaque soir se dit: Je ne serais pas sans pain si le
  père de monsieur de Camps n'avait pas été un malhonnête homme!»
--Comment, s'écria monsieur de Bourbonne en interrompant, tu as eu la
niaiserie de raconter à cette femme l'affaire de ton père avec les
Bourgneuf?... Les femmes s'entendent bien plus à manger une fortune qu'à
la faire...
--Elles s'entendent en probité. Laissez-moi continuer, mon oncle.
  «Octave, aucune puissance au monde n'a l'autorité de changer le
  langage de l'honneur. Retire-toi dans ta conscience, et demande-lui
  par quel mot nommer l'action à laquelle tu dois ton or.»
Et le neveu regarda l'oncle qui baissa la tête.
  «Je ne te dirai pas toutes les pensées qui m'assiégent, elles peuvent
  se réduire toutes à une seule, et la voici: je ne puis pas estimer un
  homme qui se salit sciemment pour une somme d'argent quelle qu'elle
  soit. Cent sous volés au jeu, ou six fois cent mille francs dus à une
  tromperie légale, déshonorent également un homme. Je veux tout te
  dire: je me regarde comme entachée par un amour qui naguère faisait
  tout mon bonheur. Il s'élève au fond de mon âme une voix que ma
  tendresse ne peut pas étouffer. Ah! j'ai pleuré d'avoir plus de
  conscience que d'amour. Tu pourrais commettre un crime, je te
  cacherais à la justice humaine dans mon sein, si je le pouvais; mais
  mon dévouement n'irait que jusque-là. L'amour, mon ange, est, chez une
  femme, la confiance la plus illimitée, unie à je ne sais quel besoin
  de vénérer, d'adorer l'être auquel elle appartient. Je n'ai jamais
  conçu l'amour que comme un feu auquel s'épuraient encore les plus
  nobles sentiments, un feu qui les développait tous. Je n'ai plus
  qu'une seule chose à te dire: viens à moi pauvre, mon amour redoublera
  si cela se peut; sinon, renonce à moi. Si je ne te vois plus, je sais
  ce qui me reste à faire. Maintenant, je ne veux pas, entends-moi bien,
  que tu restitues parce que je te le conseille. Consulte bien ta
  conscience. Il ne faut pas que cet acte de justice soit un sacrifice
  fait à l'amour. Je suis ta femme, et non ta maîtresse; il s'agit moins
  de me plaire que de m'inspirer pour toi la plus profonde estime. Si je
  me trompe, si tu m'as mal expliqué l'action de ton père; enfin, pour
  peu que tu croies ta fortune légitime (oh! je voudrais me persuader
  que tu ne mérites aucun blâme!), décide en écoutant la voix de ta
  conscience, agis bien par toi-même. Un homme qui aime sincèrement,
  comme tu m'aimes, respecte trop tout ce que sa femme met en lui de
  sainteté pour être improbe. Je me reproche maintenant tout ce que je
  viens d'écrire. Un mot suffisait peut-être, et mon instinct de
  prêcheuse m'a emportée. Aussi voudrais-je être grondée, pas trop fort,
  mais un peu. Cher, entre nous deux, n'es-tu pas le pouvoir? tu dois
  seul apercevoir tes fautes. Eh! bien, mon maître, diriez-vous que je
  ne comprends rien aux discussions politiques?»
--Eh! bien, mon oncle, dit Octave dont les yeux étaient pleins de
larmes.
--Mais je vois encore de l'écriture, achève donc.
--Oh! maintenant, il n'y a plus que de ces choses qui ne doivent être
lues que par un amant.
--Bien, dit le vieillard, bien, mon enfant. J'ai eu beaucoup de bonnes
fortunes; mais je te prie de croire que j'ai aussi aimé, _et ego in
Arcadiâ_. Seulement, je ne conçois pas pourquoi tu donnes des leçons de
mathématiques.
--Mon cher oncle, je suis votre neveu; n'est-ce pas vous dire, en deux
mots, que j'avais bien un peu entamé le capital laissé par mon père?
Après avoir lu cette lettre, il s'est fait en moi toute une révolution,
et j'ai payé en un moment l'arriéré de mes remords. Je ne pourrai jamais
vous peindre l'état dans lequel j'étais. En conduisant mon cabriolet au
bois, une voix me criait: «Ce cheval est-il à toi?» En mangeant, je me
disais: «N'est-ce pas un dîner volé?» J'avais honte de moi-même. Plus
jeune était ma probité, plus elle était ardente. D'abord j'ai couru chez
madame Firmiani. O Dieu! mon oncle, ce jour-là j'ai eu des plaisirs de
coeur, des voluptés d'âme qui valaient des millions. J'ai fait avec elle
le compte de ce que je devais à la famille Bourgneuf, et je me suis
condamné moi-même à lui payer trois pour cent d'intérêt contre l'avis de
madame Firmiani; mais toute ma fortune ne pouvait suffire à solder la
somme. Nous étions alors l'un et l'autre assez amants, assez époux, elle
pour offrir, moi pour accepter ses économies...
--Comment, outre ses vertus, cette femme adorable fait des économies?
s'écria l'oncle.
--Ne vous moquez pas d'elle, mon oncle. Sa position l'oblige à bien des
ménagements. Son mari partit en 1820 pour la Grèce, où il est mort
depuis trois ans; jusqu'à ce jour, il a été impossible d'avoir la preuve
légale de sa mort, et de se procurer le testament qu'il a dû faire en
faveur de sa femme, pièce importante qui a été prise, perdue ou égarée
dans un pays où les actes de l'état civil ne sont pas tenus comme en
France, et où il n'y a pas de consul. Ignorant si un jour elle ne sera
pas forcée de compter avec des héritiers malveillants, elle est obligée
d'avoir un ordre extrême, car elle veut pouvoir laisser son opulence
comme Châteaubriand vient de quitter le ministère. Or, je veux acquérir
une fortune qui soit _mienne_, afin de rendre son opulence à ma femme,
si elle était ruinée.
--Et tu ne m'as pas dit cela, et n'es pas venu à moi?... Oh! mon neveu,
songe donc que je t'aime assez pour te payer de bonnes dettes, des
dettes de gentilhomme. Je suis un oncle à dénoûment, je me vengerai.
--Mon oncle, je connais vos vengeances, mais laissez-moi m'enrichir par
ma propre industrie. Si vous voulez m'obliger, faites-moi seulement
mille écus de pension jusqu'à ce que j'aie besoin de capitaux pour
quelque entreprise. Tenez, en ce moment je suis tellement heureux, que
ma seule affaire est de vivre. Je donne des leçons pour n'être à la
charge de personne. Ah! si vous saviez avec quel plaisir j'ai fait ma
restitution! Après quelques démarches, j'ai fini par trouver les
Bourgneuf malheureux et privés de tout. Cette famille était à
Saint-Germain dans une misérable maison. Le vieux père gérait un bureau
de loterie, ses deux filles faisaient le ménage et tenaient les
écritures. La mère était presque toujours malade. Les deux filles sont
ravissantes, mais elles ont durement appris le peu de valeur que le
monde accorde à la beauté sans fortune. Quel tableau ai-je été chercher
là! Si je suis entré le complice d'un crime, je suis sorti honnête
homme, et j'ai lavé la mémoire de mon père. Oh! mon oncle, je ne le juge
point, il y a dans les procès un entraînement, une passion qui peuvent
parfois abuser le plus honnête homme du monde. Les avocats savent
légitimer les prétentions les plus absurdes, et les lois ont des
syllogismes complaisants aux erreurs de la conscience. Mon aventure fut
un vrai drame. Avoir été la Providence, avoir réalisé un de ces souhaits
inutiles: «S'il nous tombait du ciel vingt mille livres de rente!» ce
voeu que nous formons tous en riant; faire succéder à un regard plein
d'imprécations un regard sublime de reconnaissance, d'étonnement,
d'admiration; jeter l'opulence au milieu d'une famille réunie le soir à
la lueur d'une mauvaise lampe, devant un feu de tourbe... Non, la parole
est au-dessous d'une telle scène. Mon extrême justice leur semblait
injuste. Enfin, s'il y a un paradis, mon père doit y être heureux
maintenant. Quant à moi, je suis aimé comme aucun homme ne l'a été.
Madame Firmiani m'a donné plus que le bonheur, elle m'a doué d'une
délicatesse qui me manquait peut-être. Aussi, la nommé-je _ma chère
conscience_, un de ces mots d'amour qui répondent à certaines harmonies
secrètes du coeur. La probité porte profit, j'ai l'espoir d'être bientôt
riche par moi-même, je cherche en ce moment à résoudre un problème
d'industrie, et si je réussis, je gagnerai des millions.
--O mon enfant, tu as l'âme de ta mère, dit le vieillard en retenant à
peine les larmes qui humectaient ses yeux en pensant à sa soeur.
En ce moment, malgré la distance qu'il y avait entre le sol et
l'appartement d'Octave de Camps, le jeune homme et son oncle entendirent
le bruit fait par l'arrivée d'une voiture.
--C'est elle, dit-il, je reconnais ses chevaux à la manière dont ils
arrêtent.
En effet, madame de Firmiani ne tarda pas à se montrer.
--Ah! dit-elle en faisant un mouvement de dépit à l'aspect de monsieur
de Bourbonne.--Mais notre oncle n'est pas de trop, reprit-elle en
laissant échapper un sourire. Je voulais m'agenouiller humblement devant
mon époux en le suppliant d'accepter ma fortune. L'ambassade d'Autriche
vient de m'envoyer un acte qui constate le décès de Firmiani. La pièce,
dressée par les soins de l'internonce d'Autriche à Constantinople, est
bien en règle, et le testament que gardait le valet de chambre pour me
le rendre y est joint. Octave, vous pouvez tout accepter.--Va, tu es
plus riche que moi, tu as là des trésors auxquels Dieu seul saurait
ajouter, reprit-elle en frappant sur le coeur de son mari. Puis, ne
pouvant soutenir son bonheur, elle se cacha la tête dans le sein
d'Octave.
--Ma nièce, autrefois nous faisions l'amour, aujourd'hui vous aimez, dit
l'oncle. Vous êtes tout ce qu'il y a de bon et de beau dans l'humanité;
car vous n'êtes jamais coupables de vos fautes, elles viennent toujours
de nous.
  Paris, février 1831.

(UNE DOUBLE FAMILLE.)]
UNE DOUBLE FAMILLE.
  A MADAME LA COMTESSE LOUISE DE TÜRHEIM,
  _Comme une marque du souvenir et de l'affectueux respect de son
  humble serviteur_,
  DE BALZAC.
La rue du Tourniquet-Saint-Jean, naguère une des rues les plus
tortueuses et les plus obscures du vieux quartier qui entoure
l'Hôtel-de-Ville, serpentait le long des petits jardins de la Préfecture
de Paris et venait aboutir dans la rue du Martroi, précisément à l'angle
d'un vieux mur maintenant abattu. En cet endroit se voyait le tourniquet
auquel cette rue a dû son nom, et qui ne fut détruit qu'en 1823, lorsque
la ville de Paris fit construire, sur l'emplacement d'un jardinet
dépendant de l'Hôtel-de-Ville, une salle de bal pour la fête donnée au
duc d'Angoulême à son retour d'Espagne. La partie la plus large de la
rue du Tourniquet était à son débouché dans la rue de la Tixeranderie,
où elle n'avait que cinq pieds de largeur. Aussi, par les temps
pluvieux, des eaux noirâtres baignaient-elles promptement le pied des
vieilles maisons qui bordaient cette rue, en entraînant les ordures
déposées par chaque ménage au coin des bornes. Les tombereaux ne pouvant
point passer par là, les habitants comptaient sur les orages pour
nettoyer leur rue toujours boueuse; et comment aurait-elle été propre?
lorsqu'en été le soleil dardait en aplomb ses rayons sur Paris, une
nappe d'or, aussi tranchante que la lame d'un sabre, illuminait
momentanément les ténèbres de cette rue sans pouvoir sécher l'humidité
permanente qui régnait depuis le rez-de-chaussée jusqu'au premier étage
de ces maisons noires et silencieuses. Les habitants, qui au mois de
juin allumaient leurs lampes à cinq heures du soir, ne les éteignaient
jamais en hiver. Encore aujourd'hui, si quelque courageux piéton veut
aller du Marais sur les quais, en prenant, au bout de la rue du Chaume,
les rues de l'Homme-Armé, des Billettes et des Deux-Portes qui mènent à
celle du Tourniquet-Saint-Jean, il croira n'avoir marché que sous des
caves. Presque toutes les rues de l'ancien Paris, dont les chroniques
ont tant vanté la splendeur, ressemblaient à ce dédale humide et sombre
où les antiquaires peuvent encore admirer quelques singularités
historiques. Ainsi, quand la maison qui occupait le coin formé par les
rues du Tourniquet et de la Tixeranderie subsistait, les observateurs y
remarquaient les vestiges de deux gros anneaux de fer scellés dans le
mur, un reste de ces chaînes que le quartenier faisait jadis tendre tous
les soirs pour la sûreté publique. Cette maison, remarquable par son
antiquité, avait été bâtie avec des précautions qui attestaient
l'insalubrité de ces anciens logis, car pour assainir le
rez-de-chaussée, on avait élevé les berceaux de la cave à deux pieds
environ au-dessus du sol, ce qui obligeait à monter trois marches pour
entrer dans la maison. Le chambranle de la porte bâtarde décrivait un
cintre plein, dont la clef était ornée d'une tête de femme et
d'arabesques rongées par le temps. Trois fenêtres, dont les appuis se
trouvaient à hauteur d'homme, appartenaient à un petit appartement situé
dans la partie de ce rez-de-chaussée qui donnait sur la rue du
Tourniquet d'où il tirait son jour. Ces croisées dégradées étaient
défendues par de gros barreaux en fer très-espacés et finissant par une
saillie ronde semblable à celle qui termine les grilles des boulangers.
Si pendant la journée quelque passant curieux jetait les yeux sur les
deux chambres dont se composait cet appartement, il lui était impossible
d'y rien voir, car pour découvrir dans la seconde chambre deux lits en
serge verte réunis sous la boiserie d'une vieille alcôve, il fallait le
soleil du mois de juillet; mais le soir, vers les trois heures, une fois
la chandelle allumée, on pouvait apercevoir, à travers la fenêtre de la
première pièce, une vieille femme assise sur une escabelle au coin d'une
cheminée où elle attisait un réchaud sur lequel mijotait un de ces
ragoûts semblables à ceux que savent faire les portières. Quelques rares
ustensiles de cuisine ou de ménage accrochés au fond de cette salle se
dessinaient dans le clair-obscur. A cette heure, une vieille table,
posée sur une X, mais dénuée de linge, était garnie de quelques couverts
d'étain et du plat cuisiné par la vieille. Trois méchantes chaises
meublaient cette pièce, qui servait à la fois de cuisine et de salle à
manger. Au-dessus de la cheminée s'élevaient un fragment de miroir, un
briquet, trois verres, des allumettes et un grand pot blanc tout
ébréché. Le carreau de la chambre, les ustensiles, la cheminée, tout
plaisait néanmoins par l'esprit d'ordre et d'économie que respirait cet
asile sombre et froid. Le visage pâle et ridé de la vieille femme était
en harmonie avec l'obscurité de la rue et la rouille de la maison. A la
voir au repos, sur sa chaise, on eût dit qu'elle tenait à cette maison
comme un colimaçon tient à sa coquille brune; sa figure, où je ne sais
quelle vague expression de malice perçait à travers une bonhomie
affectée, était couronnée par un bonnet de tulle rond et plat qui
cachait assez mal des cheveux blancs; ses grands yeux gris étaient aussi
calmes que la rue, et les rides nombreuses de son visage pouvaient se
comparer aux crevasses des murs. Soit qu'elle fût née dans la misère,
soit qu'elle fût déchue d'une splendeur passée, elle paraissait résignée
depuis longtemps à sa triste existence. Depuis le lever du soleil
jusqu'au soir, excepté les moments où elle préparait les repas et ceux
où chargée d'un panier elle s'absentait pour aller chercher les
provisions, cette vieille femme demeurait dans l'autre chambre devant la
dernière croisée, en face d'une jeune fille. A toute heure du jour les
passants apercevaient cette jeune ouvrière, assise dans un vieux
fauteuil de velours rouge, le cou penché sur un métier à broder,
travaillant avec ardeur. Sa mère avait un tambour vert sur les genoux et
s'occupait à faire du tulle; mais ses doigts remuaient péniblement les
bobines; sa vue était affaiblie, car son nez sexagénaire portait une
paire de ces antiques lunettes qui tiennent sur le bout des narines par
la force avec laquelle elles les compriment. Quand venait le soir, ces
deux laborieuses créatures plaçaient entre elles une lampe dont la
lumière, passant à travers deux globes de verre remplis d'eau, jetait
sur leur ouvrage une forte lueur qui permettait à l'une de voir les fils
les plus déliés fournis par les bobines de son tambour, et à l'autre les
dessins les plus délicats tracés sur l'étoffe qu'elle brodait. La
courbure des barreaux avait permis à la jeune fille de mettre sur
l'appui de la fenêtre une longue caisse en bois pleine de terre où
végétaient des pois de senteur, des capucines, un petit chèvrefeuille
malingre et des volubilis dont les tiges débiles grimpaient autour des
barreaux. Ces plantes presque étiolées produisaient de pâles fleurs,
harmonie de plus qui mêlait je ne sais quoi de triste et de doux dans le
tableau présenté par cette croisée, dont la baie encadrait bien ces deux
figures. A l'aspect fortuit de cet intérieur, le passant le plus égoïste
emportait une image complète de la vie que mène à Paris la classe
ouvrière, car la brodeuse ne paraissait vivre que de son aiguille. Bien
des gens n'atteignaient pas le tourniquet sans s'être demandé comment
une jeune fille pouvait conserver des couleurs en vivant dans cette
cave. Un étudiant passait-il par là pour gagner le pays latin, sa vive
imagination lui faisait déplorer cette vie obscure et végétative,
semblable à celle du lierre qui tapisse de froides murailles, ou à celle
de ces paysans voués au travail, et qui naissent, labourent, meurent
ignorés du monde qu'ils ont nourri. Un rentier se disait après avoir
examiné la maison avec l'oeil d'un propriétaire:--Que deviendront ces
deux femmes si la broderie vient à n'être plus de mode? Parmi les gens
qu'une place à l'Hôtel-de-Ville ou au Palais forçait à passer par cette
rue à des heures fixes, soit pour se rendre à leurs affaires, soit pour
retourner dans leurs quartiers respectifs, peut-être se trouvait-il
quelque coeur charitable. Peut-être un homme veuf ou un Adonis de
quarante ans, à force de sonder les replis de cette vie malheureuse,
comptait-il sur la détresse de la mère et de la fille pour posséder à
bon marché l'innocente ouvrière dont les mains agiles et potelées, le
cou frais et la peau blanche, attrait dû sans doute à l'habitation de
cette rue sans soleil, excitaient son admiration. Peut-être aussi
quelque honnête employé à douze cents francs d'appointements, témoin
journalier de l'ardeur que cette jeune fille portait au travail,
estimateur de ses moeurs pures, attendait-il de l'avancement pour unir
une vie obscure à une vie obscure, un labeur obstiné à un autre,
apportant au moins et un bras d'homme pour soutenir cette existence, et
un paisible amour, décoloré comme les fleurs de sa croisée. De vagues
espérances animaient les yeux ternes et gris de la vieille mère. Le
matin, après le plus modeste de tous les déjeuners, elle revenait
prendre son tambour plutôt par maintien que par obligation, car elle
posait ses lunettes sur une petite travailleuse de bois rougi, aussi
vieille qu'elle, et passait en revue, de huit heures et demie à dix
heures environ, les gens habitués à traverser la rue; elle recueillait
leurs regards, faisait des observations sur leurs démarches, sur leurs
toilettes, sur leurs physionomies, et semblait leur marchander sa fille,
tant ses yeux babillards essayaient d'établir entre eux de sympathiques
affections, par un manége digne des coulisses. On devinait facilement
que cette revue était pour elle un spectacle, et peut-être son seul
plaisir. La fille levait rarement la tête, la pudeur, ou peut-être le
sentiment pénible de sa détresse, semblait retenir sa figure attachée
sur le métier; aussi, pour qu'elle montrât aux passants sa mine
chiffonnée, sa mère devait-elle avoir poussé quelque exclamation de
surprise. L'employé vêtu d'une redingote neuve, ou l'habitué qui se
produisait avec une femme à son bras, pouvaient alors voir le nez
légèrement retroussé de l'ouvrière, sa petite bouche rose, et ses yeux
gris toujours pétillants de vie, malgré ses accablantes fatigues; ses
laborieuses insomnies ne se trahissaient guère que par un cercle plus ou
moins blanc dessiné sous chacun de ses yeux, sur la peau fraîche de ses
pommettes. La pauvre enfant semblait être née pour l'amour et la gaieté,
pour l'amour qui avait peint au-dessus de ses paupières bridées deux
arcs parfaits, et qui lui avait donné une si ample forêt de cheveux
châtains qu'elle aurait pu se trouver sous sa chevelure comme sous un
pavillon impénétrable à l'oeil d'un amant; pour la gaieté qui agitait
ses deux narines mobiles, qui formait deux fossettes dans ses joues
fraîches et lui faisait si vite oublier ses peines; pour la gaieté,
cette fleur de l'espérance, qui lui prêtait la force d'apercevoir sans
frémir l'aride chemin de sa vie. La tête de la jeune fille était
toujours soigneusement peignée. Suivant l'habitude des ouvrières de
Paris, sa toilette lui semblait finie quand elle avait lissé ses cheveux
et retroussé en deux arcs le petit bouquet qui se jouait de chaque côté
des tempes et tranchait sur la blancheur de sa peau. La naissance de sa
chevelure avait tant de grâce, la ligne de bistre nettement dessinée sur
son cou donnait une si charmante idée de sa jeunesse et de ses attraits,
que l'observateur, en la voyant penchée sur son ouvrage, sans que le
bruit lui fît relever la tête, devait l'accuser de coquetterie. De si
séduisantes promesses excitaient la curiosité de plus d'un jeune homme
qui se retournait en vain dans l'espérance de voir ce modeste visage.
--Caroline, nous avons un habitué de plus, et aucun de nos anciens ne le
vaut.
Ces paroles, prononcées à voix basse par la mère, dans une matinée du
mois d'août 1815, avaient vaincu l'indifférence de la jeune ouvrière,
qui regarda vainement dans la rue: l'inconnu était déjà loin.
--Par où s'est-il envolé? demanda-t-elle.
--Il reviendra sans doute à quatre heures, je le verrai venir, et
t'avertirai en te poussant le pied. Je suis sûre qu'il repassera, voici
trois jours qu'il prend par notre rue; mais il est inexact dans ses
heures: le premier jour il est arrivé à six heures, avant-hier à quatre,
et hier à trois. Je me souviens de l'avoir vu autrefois de temps à
autre. C'est quelque employé de la Préfecture qui aura changé
d'appartement dans le Marais.--Tiens, ajouta-t-elle, après avoir jeté un
coup d'oeil dans la rue, notre monsieur à l'habit marron a pris
perruque; comme cela le change!
Le monsieur à l'habit marron devait être celui des habitués qui fermait
la procession quotidienne, car la vieille mère remit ses lunettes,
reprit son ouvrage en poussant un soupir et jeta sur sa fille un si
singulier regard, qu'il eût été difficile à Lavater lui-même de
l'analyser. L'admiration, la reconnaissance, une sorte d'espérance pour
un meilleur avenir, se mêlaient à l'orgueil de posséder une fille si
jolie. Le soir, sur les quatre heures, la vieille poussa le pied de
Caroline, qui leva le nez assez à temps pour voir le nouvel acteur dont
le passage périodique allait animer la scène. Grand, mince, pâle et vêtu
de noir, cet homme paraissait avoir quarante ans environ, et sa démarche
avait quelque chose de solennel; quand son oeil fauve et perçant
rencontra le regard terni de la vieille, il la fit trembler; elle crut
s'apercevoir qu'il savait lire au fond des coeurs. L'inconnu se tenait
très-droit, et son abord devait être aussi glacial que l'était l'air de
cette rue; le teint terreux et verdâtre de son visage était-il le
résultat de travaux excessifs, ou produit par une santé frêle et
maladive? Ce problème fut résolu par la vieille mère de vingt manières
différentes matin et soir. Caroline seule devina tout d'abord sur ce
visage abattu les traces d'une longue souffrance d'âme: ce front facile
à se rider, ces joues légèrement creusées gardaient l'empreinte du sceau
avec lequel le malheur marque ses sujets, comme pour leur laisser la
consolation de se reconnaître d'un oeil fraternel et de s'unir pour lui
résister. Si le regard de la jeune fille s'anima d'abord d'une curiosité
tout innocente, il prit une douce expression de sympathie à mesure que
l'inconnu s'éloignait, semblable au dernier parent qui ferme un convoi.
La chaleur était en ce moment si forte, et la distraction du passant si
grande, qu'il n'avait pas remis son chapeau en traversant cette rue
malsaine, Caroline put alors remarquer, pendant le moment où elle
l'observa, l'apparence de sévérité que ses cheveux relevés en brosse
au-dessus de son front large répandaient sur sa figure. L'impression
vive, mais sans charme, ressentie par Caroline à l'aspect de cet homme,
ne ressemblait à aucune des sensations que les autres habitués lui
avaient fait éprouver; pour la première fois, sa compassion s'exerçait
sur un autre que sur elle-même et sur sa mère, elle ne répondit rien aux
conjectures bizarres qui fournirent un aliment à l'agaçante loquacité de
sa vieille mère, et tira silencieusement sa longue aiguille dessus et
dessous le tulle tendu; elle regrettait de ne pas avoir assez vu
l'étranger, et attendit au lendemain pour porter sur lui un jugement
définitif. Pour la première fois aussi, l'un des habitués de la rue lui
suggérait autant de réflexions. Ordinairement, elle n'opposait qu'un
sourire triste aux suppositions de sa mère qui voulait voir dans chaque
passant un protecteur pour sa fille. Si de semblables idées,
imprudemment présentées par cette mère à sa fille, n'éveillaient point
de mauvaises pensées, il fallait attribuer l'insouciance de Caroline à
ce travail obstiné, malheureusement nécessaire, qui consumait les forces
de sa précieuse jeunesse, et devait infailliblement altérer un jour la
limpidité de ses yeux, ou ravir à ses joues blanches les tendres
couleurs qui les nuançaient encore. Pendant deux grands mois environ, la
nouvelle connaissance eut une allure très-capricieuse. L'inconnu ne
passait pas toujours par la rue du Tourniquet, car la vieille le voyait
souvent le soir sans l'avoir aperçu le matin; il ne revenait pas à des
heures aussi fixes que les autres employés qui servaient de pendule à
madame Crochard; enfin, excepté la première rencontre où son regard
avait inspiré une sorte de crainte à la vieille mère, jamais ses yeux ne
parurent faire attention au tableau pittoresque que présentaient ces
deux gnômes femelles. A l'exception de deux grandes portes et de la
boutique obscure d'un ferrailleur, il n'existait à cette époque, dans la
rue du Tourniquet, que des fenêtres grillées qui éclairaient par des
jours de souffrance les escaliers de quelques maisons voisines; le peu
de curiosité du passant ne pouvait donc pas se justifier par de
dangereuses rivalités; aussi, madame Crochard était-elle piquée de voir
son _monsieur noir_, tel fut le nom qu'elle lui donna, toujours
gravement préoccupé, tenir les yeux baissés vers la terre ou levés en
avant, comme s'il eût voulu lire l'avenir dans le brouillard du
Tourniquet. Néanmoins, un matin, vers la fin du mois de septembre, la
tête lutine de Caroline Crochard se détachait si brillamment sur le fond
obscur de sa chambre, et se montrait si fraîche au milieu des fleurs
tardives et des feuillages flétris entrelacés autour des barreaux de la
fenêtre; enfin la scène journalière présentait alors des oppositions
d'ombre et de lumière, de blanc et de rose, si bien mariées à la
mousseline que festonnait la gentille ouvrière, avec les tons bruns et
rouges des fauteuils, que l'inconnu contempla fort attentivement les
effets de ce vivant tableau. Fatiguée de l'indifférence de son monsieur
noir, la vieille mère avait, à la vérité, pris le parti de faire un tel
cliquetis avec ses bobines, que le passant morne et soucieux fut
peut-être contraint par ce bruit insolite à regarder chez elle.
L'étranger échangea seulement avec Caroline un regard, rapide il est
vrai, mais par lequel leurs âmes eurent un léger contact, et ils
conçurent tous deux le pressentiment qu'ils penseraient l'un à l'autre.
Quand le soir, à quatre heures, l'inconnu revint, Caroline distingua le
bruit de ses pas sur le pavé criard, et quand ils s'examinèrent, il y
eut de part et d'autre une sorte de préméditation: les yeux du passant
furent animés d'un sentiment de bienveillance qui le fit sourire, et
Caroline rougit: la vieille mère les observa tous deux d'un air
satisfait. A compter de cette mémorable matinée, le monsieur noir
traversa deux fois par jour la rue du Tourniquet, à quelques exceptions
près, que les deux femmes surent remarquer; elles jugèrent, d'après
l'irrégularité de ses heures de retour, qu'il n'était ni aussi
promptement libre, ni aussi strictement exact qu'un employé subalterne.
Pendant les trois premiers mois de l'hiver, deux fois par jour, Caroline
et le passant se virent ainsi pendant le temps qu'il mettait à franchir
l'espace de chaussée occupé par la porte et par les trois fenêtres de la
maison. De jour en jour cette rapide entrevue eut un caractère
d'intimité bienveillante qui finit par contracter quelque chose de
fraternel. Caroline et l'inconnu parurent d'abord se comprendre; puis, à
force d'examiner l'un et l'autre leurs visages, ils en prirent une
connaissance approfondie. Ce fut bientôt comme une visite que le passant
faisait à Caroline; si, par hasard, son monsieur noir passait sans lui
apporter le sourire à demi formé par sa bouche éloquente ou le regard
ami de ses yeux bruns, il lui manquait quelque chose: sa journée était
incomplète. Elle ressemblait à ces vieillards pour lesquels la lecture
de leur journal est devenue un tel plaisir, que, le lendemain d'une fête
solennelle, ils s'en vont tout déroutés demandant, autant par mégarde
que par impatience, la feuille à l'aide de laquelle ils trompent un
moment le vide de leur existence. Mais ces fugitives apparitions
avaient, autant pour l'inconnu que pour Caroline, l'intérêt d'une
causerie familière entre deux amis. La jeune fille ne pouvait pas plus
dérober à l'oeil intelligent de son silencieux ami une tristesse, une
inquiétude, un malaise que celui-ci ne pouvait cacher à Caroline une
préoccupation.--«Il a eu du chagrin hier!» était une pensée qui naissait
souvent au coeur de l'ouvrière quand elle contemplait la figure altérée
du monsieur noir.--«Oh! il a beaucoup travaillé!» était une exclamation
due à d'autres nuances que Caroline savait distinguer. L'inconnu
devinait aussi que la jeune fille avait passé son dimanche à finir la
robe au dessin de laquelle il s'était intéressé; il voyait, aux
approches des termes de loyer, cette jolie figure assombrie par
l'inquiétude, et il devinait quand Caroline avait veillé; mais il avait
surtout remarqué comment les pensées tristes qui défloraient les traits
gais et délicats de cette jeune tête s'étaient graduellement dissipées à
mesure que leur connaissance avait vieilli. Lorsque l'hiver vint sécher
les tiges, les fleurs et les feuillages du jardin parisien qui décorait
la fenêtre, et que la fenêtre se ferma, l'inconnu ne vit pas, sans un
sourire doucement malicieux, la clarté extraordinaire du carreau qui se
trouvait à la hauteur de la tête de Caroline; la parcimonie du feu,
quelques traces d'une rougeur qui couperosait la figure des deux femmes
lui dénoncèrent l'indigence du petit ménage; mais si quelque douloureuse
compassion se peignait alors dans ses yeux, Caroline lui opposait une
gaieté fière. Cependant les sentiments éclos au fond de leurs coeurs y
restaient ensevelis, sans qu'aucun événement leur en apprît l'un à
l'autre la force et l'étendue, ils ne connaissaient même pas le son de
leurs voix. Ces deux amis muets se gardaient, comme d'un malheur, de
s'engager dans une plus intime union. Chacun d'eux semblait craindre
d'apporter à l'autre une infortune plus pesante que celle qu'il voulait
partager. Était-ce cette pudeur d'amitié qui les arrêtait ainsi?
Était-ce cette appréhension de l'égoïsme ou cette méfiance atroce qui
séparent tous les habitants réunis dans les murs d'une nombreuse cité?
La voix secrète de leur conscience les avertissait-elle d'un péril
prochain? Il serait impossible d'expliquer le sentiment qui les rendait
aussi ennemis qu'amis, aussi indifférents l'un à l'autre qu'ils étaient
attachés, aussi unis par l'instinct que séparés par le fait. Peut-être
chacun d'eux voulait-il conserver ses illusions. On eût dit parfois que
l'inconnu craignait d'entendre sortir quelques paroles grossières de ces
lèvres aussi fraîches, aussi pures qu'une fleur, et que Caroline ne se
croyait pas digne de cet être mystérieux en qui tout révélait le pouvoir
et la fortune. Quant à madame Crochard, cette tendre mère, presque
mécontente de l'indécision dans laquelle restait sa fille, montrait une
mine boudeuse à son monsieur noir à qui elle avait jusque-là toujours
souri d'un air aussi complaisant que servile. Jamais elle ne s'était
plainte aussi amèrement à sa fille d'être encore à son âge obligée de
faire la cuisine; à aucune époque ses rhumatismes et son catarrhe ne lui
avaient arraché autant de gémissements; enfin, elle ne sut pas faire,
pendant cet hiver, le nombre d'aunes de tulle sur lequel Caroline avait
compté jusqu'alors. Dans ces circonstances et vers la fin du mois de
décembre, à l'époque où le pain était le plus cher et où l'on ressentait
déjà le commencement de cette cherté des grains qui rendit l'année 1816
si cruelle aux pauvres gens, le passant remarqua sur le visage de la
jeune fille dont le nom lui était inconnu, les traces affreuses d'une
pensée secrète que ses sourires bienveillants ne dissipèrent pas.
Bientôt il reconnut, dans les yeux de Caroline, les flétrissants indices
d'un travail nocturne. Dans une des dernières nuits de ce mois, le
passant revint, contrairement à ses habitudes, vers une heure du matin
par la rue du Tourniquet-Saint-Jean. Le silence de la nuit lui permit
d'entendre de loin, avant d'arriver à la maison de Caroline, la voix
pleurarde de la vieille mère et celle plus douloureuse de la jeune
ouvrière, dont les éclats retentissaient mêlés aux sifflements d'une
pluie de neige; il tâcha d'arriver à pas lents; puis, au risque de se
faire arrêter, il se tapit devant la croisée pour écouter la mère et la
fille en les examinant par le plus grand des trous qui découpaient les
rideaux de mousseline jaunie, et les rendaient semblables à ces grandes
feuilles de chou mangées en rond par des chenilles. Le curieux passant
vit un papier timbré sur la table qui séparait les deux métiers et sur
laquelle était posée la lampe entre les deux globes pleins d'eau. Il
reconnut facilement une assignation. Madame Crochard pleurait, et la
voix de Caroline avait un son guttural qui en altérait le timbre doux et
caressant.
--Pourquoi tant te désoler, ma mère? Monsieur Molineux ne vendra pas nos
meubles et ne nous chassera pas avant que j'aie terminé cette robe;
encore deux nuits, et j'irai la porter chez madame Roguin.
--Et si elle te fait attendre comme toujours? mais le prix de ta robe
paiera-t-il aussi le boulanger?
Le spectateur de cette scène possédait une telle habitude de lire sur
les visages, qu'il crut entrevoir autant de fausseté dans la douleur de
la mère que de vérité dans le chagrin de la fille; il disparut aussitôt,
et revint quelques instants après. Quand il regarda par le trou de la
mousseline, la mère était couchée; penchée sur son métier, la jeune
ouvrière travaillait avec une infatigable activité; sur la table, à côté
de l'assignation, se trouvait un morceau de pain triangulairement coupé,
posé sans doute là pour la nourrir pendant la nuit, tout en lui
rappelant la récompense de son courage. L'inconnu frissonna
d'attendrissement et de douleur, il jeta sa bourse à travers une vitre
fêlée de manière à la faire tomber aux pieds de la jeune fille; puis,
sans jouir de sa surprise, il s'évada le coeur palpitant, les joues en
feu. Le lendemain, le triste et sauvage étranger passa en affectant un
air préoccupé, mais il ne put échapper à la reconnaissance de Caroline
qui avait ouvert la fenêtre et s'amusait à bêcher avec un couteau la
caisse carrée couverte de neige, prétexte dont la maladresse ingénieuse
annonçait à son bienfaiteur qu'elle ne voulait pas, cette fois, le voir
à travers les vitres. La brodeuse fit, les yeux pleins de larmes, un
signe de tête à son protecteur comme pour lui dire:--Je ne puis vous
payer qu'avec le coeur. Mais l'inconnu parut ne rien comprendre à
l'expression de cette reconnaissance vraie. Le soir, quand il repassa,
Caroline, qui s'occupait à recoller une feuille de papier sur la vitre
brisée, put lui sourire en montrant comme une promesse, l'émail de ses
dents brillantes. Le monsieur noir prit dès lors un autre chemin et ne
se montra plus dans la rue du Tourniquet.
Dans les premiers jours du mois de mai suivant, un samedi matin que
Caroline apercevait, entre les deux lignes noires des maisons, une
faible portion d'un ciel sans nuages, et pendant qu'elle arrosait avec
un verre d'eau le pied de son chèvrefeuille, elle dit à sa mère: «Maman,
il faut aller demain nous promener à Montmorency! A peine cette phrase
était-elle prononcée d'un air joyeux, que le monsieur noir vint à
passer, plus triste et plus accablé que jamais; le chaste et caressant
regard que Caroline lui jeta pouvait passer pour une invitation. Aussi,
le lendemain, quand madame Crochard, vêtue d'une redingote de mérinos
brun rouge, d'un chapeau de soie et d'un châle à grandes raies imitant
le cachemire, se présenta pour choisir un coucou au coin de la rue du
Faubourg-Saint-Denis et de la rue d'Enghien, y trouva-t-elle son
inconnu, planté sur ses pieds comme un homme qui attend sa femme. Un
sourire de plaisir dérida la figure de l'étranger quand il aperçut
Caroline dont le petit pied était chaussé de guêtres en prunelle couleur
puce, dont la robe blanche, emportée par un vent perfide pour les femmes
mal faites, dessinait des formes attrayantes, et dont la figure,
ombragée par un chapeau de paille de riz doublée en satin rose, était
comme illuminée d'un reflet céleste; sa large ceinture de couleur puce
faisait valoir une taille à tenir entre les deux mains; ses cheveux,
partagés en deux bandeaux de bistre sur un front blanc comme de la
neige, lui donnaient un air de candeur que rien ne démentait. Le plaisir
semblait rendre Caroline aussi légère que la paille de son chapeau, mais
il y eut en elle une espérance qui éclipsa tout à coup sa parure et sa
beauté quand elle vit le monsieur noir. Celui-ci, qui semblait irrésolu,
fut peut-être décidé à servir de compagnon de voyage à l'ouvrière par la
subite révélation du bonheur que causait sa présence. Il loua, pour
aller à Saint-Leu-Taverny, un cabriolet dont le cheval paraissait assez
bon; il offrit à madame Crochard et à sa fille d'y prendre place, et la
mère accepta sans se faire prier; mais au moment où la voiture se trouva
sur la route de Saint-Denis, elle s'avisa d'avoir des scrupules et de
hasarder quelques civilités sur la gêne que deux femmes allaient causer
à leur compagnon.
--Monsieur voulait peut-être se rendre seul à Saint-Leu? dit-elle avec
une fausse bonhomie. Mais elle ne tarda pas à se plaindre de la chaleur,
et surtout de son catarrhe, qui, disait-elle, ne lui avait pas permis de
fermer l'oeil une seule fois pendant la nuit; aussi, à peine la voiture
eut-elle atteint Saint-Denis, que madame Crochard parut endormie;
quelques-uns de ses ronflements semblèrent suspects à l'inconnu, qui
fronça les sourcils en regardant la vieille femme d'un air
singulièrement soupçonneux.
--Oh! elle dort, dit naïvement Caroline, elle n'a pas cessé de tousser
depuis hier soir. Elle doit être bien fatiguée.
Pour toute réponse, le compagnon de voyage jeta sur la jeune fille un
rusé sourire comme pour lui dire:--Innocente créature, tu ne connais pas
ta mère! Cependant, malgré sa défiance, et quand la voiture roula sur la
terre dans cette longue avenue de peupliers qui conduit à Eaubonne, le
monsieur noir crut madame Crochard réellement endormie; peut-être aussi
ne voulait-il plus examiner jusqu'à quel point ce sommeil était feint ou
véritable. Soit que la beauté du ciel, l'air pur de la campagne et ces
parfums enivrants répandus par les premières pousses des peupliers, par
les fleurs du saule, et par celles des épines blanches, eussent disposé
son coeur à s'épanouir, comme s'épanouissait la nature; soit qu'une plus
longue contrainte lui devînt importune, ou que les yeux pétillants de
Caroline eussent répondu à l'inquiétude des siens, l'inconnu entreprit
avec sa jeune compagne une conversation aussi vague que les balancements
des arbres sous l'effort de la brise, aussi vagabonde que les détours du
papillon dans l'air bleu, aussi peu raisonnée que la voix doucement
mélodieuse des champs, mais empreinte comme elle d'un mystérieux amour.
A cette époque, la campagne n'est-elle pas frémissante comme une fiancée
qui a revêtu sa robe d'hyménée, et ne convie-t-elle pas au plaisir les
âmes les plus froides? Quitter les rues ténébreuses du Marais, pour la
première fois depuis le dernier automne, et se trouver au sein de
l'harmonieuse et pittoresque vallée de Montmorency; la traverser au
matin, en ayant devant les yeux l'infini de ses horizons, et pouvoir
reporter, de là, son regard sur des yeux qui peignent aussi l'infini en
exprimant l'amour, quels coeurs resteraient glacés, quelles lèvres
garderaient un secret? L'inconnu trouva Caroline plus gaie que
spirituelle, plus aimante qu'instruite; mais, si son rire accusait de la
folâtrerie, ses paroles promettaient un sentiment vrai. Quand, aux
interrogations sagaces de son compagnon, la jeune fille répondait par
une effusion de coeur que les classes inférieures prodiguent sans y
mettre de réticences comme les gens du grand monde, la figure du
monsieur noir s'animait et semblait renaître; sa physionomie perdait par
degrés la tristesse qui en contractait les traits; puis, de teinte en
teinte, elle prit un air de jeunesse et un caractère de beauté qui
rendirent Caroline heureuse et fière. La jolie brodeuse devina que son
protecteur était un être sevré depuis long-temps de tendresse et
d'amour, de plaisir et de caresses, ou que peut-être il ne croyait plus
au dévouement d'une femme. Enfin, une saillie inattendue du léger babil
de Caroline enleva le dernier voile qui ôtait à la figure de l'inconnu
sa jeunesse réelle et son caractère primitif; il sembla faire un éternel
divorce avec des idées importunes, et déploya la vivacité d'âme que
décelait sa figure. La causerie devint insensiblement si familière,
qu'au moment où la voiture s'arrêta aux premières maisons du long
village de Saint-Leu, Caroline nommait l'inconnu monsieur Roger. Pour la
première fois seulement, la vieille mère se réveilla.
--Caroline, elle aura tout entendu, dit Roger d'une voix soupçonneuse à
l'oreille de la jeune fille.
Caroline répondit par un ravissant sourire d'incrédulité qui dissipa le
nuage sombre que la crainte d'un calcul chez la mère avait répandue sur
le front de cet homme défiant. Sans s'étonner de rien, madame Crochard
approuva tout, suivit sa fille et monsieur Roger dans le parc de
Saint-Leu, où les deux jeunes gens étaient convenus d'aller pour visiter
les riantes prairies et les bosquets embaumés que le goût de la reine
Hortense a rendus si célèbres.
--Mon Dieu, combien cela est beau! s'écria Caroline lorsque, montée sur
la croupe verte où commence la forêt de Montmorency, elle aperçut à ses
pieds l'immense vallée qui déroulait ses sinuosités semées de villages,
les horizons bleuâtres de ses collines, ses clochers, ses prairies, ses
champs, et dont le murmure vint expirer à l'oreille de la jeune fille
comme un bruissement de la mer. Les trois voyageurs côtoyèrent les bords
d'une rivière factice, et arrivèrent à cette vallée suisse dont le
chalet reçut plus d'une fois la reine Hortense et Napoléon. Quand
Caroline se fut assise avec un saint respect sur le banc de bois moussu
où s'étaient reposés des rois, des princesses et l'empereur, madame
Crochard manifesta le désir de voir de plus près un pont suspendu entre
deux rochers qui s'apercevait au loin, et se dirigea vers cette
curiosité champêtre en laissant son enfant sous la garde de monsieur
Roger, mais en lui disant qu'elle ne les perdrait pas de vue.
--Eh! quoi, pauvre petite, s'écria Roger, vous n'avez jamais désiré la
fortune et les jouissances du luxe? Vous ne souhaitez pas quelquefois de
porter les belles robes que vous brodez?
--Je vous mentirais, monsieur Roger, si je vous disais que je ne pense
pas au bonheur dont jouissent les riches. Ah! oui, je songe souvent,
quand je m'endors surtout, au plaisir que j'aurais de voir ma pauvre
mère ne pas être obligée d'aller par le mauvais temps chercher nos
petites provisions, à son âge. Je voudrais que le matin une femme de
ménage lui apportât, pendant qu'elle est encore au lit, son café bien
sucré avec du sucre blanc. Elle aime à lire des romans, la pauvre bonne
femme, eh! bien, je préférerais lui voir user ses yeux à sa lecture
favorite, plutôt qu'à remuer des bobines depuis le matin jusqu'au soir.
Il lui faudrait aussi un peu de bon vin. Enfin je voudrais la savoir
heureuse, elle est si bonne!
--Elle vous a donc bien prouvé sa bonté?
--Oh! oui, répliqua la jeune fille d'un son de voix profond. Puis après
un assez court moment de silence pendant lequel les deux jeunes gens
regardèrent madame Crochard qui, parvenue au milieu du pont rustique,
les menaçait du doigt, Caroline reprit:--Oh! oui, elle me l'a prouvé.
Combien ne m'a-t-elle pas soignée quand j'étais petite! Elle a vendu ses
derniers couverts d'argent pour me mettre en apprentissage chez la
vieille fille qui m'a appris à broder. Et mon pauvre père! combien de
mal n'a-t-elle pas eu pour lui faire passer heureusement ses derniers
moments! A cette idée la jeune fille tressaillit et se fit un voile de
ses deux mains.--Ah! bah, ne pensons jamais aux malheurs passés,
dit-elle en essayant de reprendre un air enjoué. Elle rougit en
s'apercevant que Roger s'était attendri, mais elle n'osa le regarder.
--Que faisait donc votre père, demanda-t-il.
--Mon père était danseur à l'Opéra avant la révolution, dit-elle de
l'air le plus naturel du monde, et ma mère chantait dans les choeurs.
Mon père, qui commandait les évolutions sur le théâtre, se trouva par
hasard à la prise de la Bastille. Il fut reconnu par quelques-uns des
assaillants qui lui demandèrent s'il ne dirigerait pas bien une attaque
réelle, lui qui en commandait de feintes au théâtre. Mon père était
brave, il accepta, conduisit les insurgés, et fut récompensé par le
grade de capitaine dans l'armée de Sambre-et-Meuse, où il se comporta de
manière à monter rapidement en grade, il devint colonel; mais il fut si
grièvement blessé à Lutzen qu'il est revenu mourir à Paris, après un an
de maladie. Les Bourbons sont arrivés, ma mère n'a pu obtenir de
pension, et nous sommes retombées dans une si grande misère, qu'il a
fallu travailler pour vivre. Depuis quelque temps la bonne femme est
devenue maladive; aussi jamais ne l'ai-je vue si peu résignée; elle se
plaint; et je le conçois, elle a goûté les douceurs d'une vie heureuse.
Quant à moi, qui ne saurais regretter des délices que je n'ai pas
connues, je ne demande qu'une seule chose au ciel...
--Quoi? dit vivement Roger qui semblait rêveur.
--Que les femmes portent toujours des tulles brodés pour que l'ouvrage
ne manque jamais.
La franchise de ces aveux intéressa le jeune homme, qui regarda d'un
oeil moins hostile madame Crochard quand elle revint vers eux d'un pas
lent.
--Hé bien, mes enfants, avez-vous bien jasé? leur demanda-t-elle d'un
air tout à la fois indulgent et railleur. Quand on pense, monsieur
Roger, que le _petit caporal_ s'est assis là où vous êtes! reprit-elle
après un moment de silence.--Pauvre homme! ajouta-t-elle, mon mari
l'aimait-il! Ah! Crochard a aussi bien fait de mourir, car il n'aurait
pas enduré de le savoir là où _ils_ l'ont mis.
Roger posa un doigt sur ses lèvres, et la bonne vieille, hochant la
tête, dit d'un air sérieux:--Suffit, on aura la bouche close et la
langue morte. Mais, ajouta-t-elle en ouvrant les bords de son corsage et
montrant une croix et son ruban rouge suspendus à son cou par une faveur
noire, _ils_ ne m'empêcheront pas de porter ce que l'_autre_ a donné à
mon pauvre Crochard, et je me ferai certes enterrer avec...
En entendant des paroles qui passaient alors pour séditieuses, Roger
interrompit la vieille mère en se levant brusquement, et ils
retournèrent au village à travers les allées du parc. Le jeune homme
s'absenta pendant quelques instants pour aller commander un repas chez
le meilleur traiteur de Taverny; puis il revint chercher les deux
femmes, et les y conduisit en les faisant passer par les sentiers de la
forêt. Le dîner fut gai. Roger n'était déjà plus cette ombre sinistre
qui passait naguère rue du Tourniquet, il ressemblait moins au
_monsieur noir_ qu'à un jeune homme confiant, prêt à s'abandonner au
courant de la vie, comme ces deux femmes insouciantes et laborieuses
qui, le lendemain peut-être, manqueraient de pain; il paraissait être
sous l'influence des joies du premier âge, son sourire avait quelque
chose de caressant et d'enfantin. Quand, sur les cinq heures, le joyeux
dîner fut terminé par quelques verres de vin de Champagne, Roger proposa
le premier d'aller sous les châtaigniers au bal du village, où Caroline
et lui dansèrent ensemble: leurs mains se pressèrent avec intelligence,
leurs coeurs battirent animés d'une même espérance; et sous le ciel
bleu, aux rayons obliques et rouges du couchant, leurs regards
arrivèrent à un éclat qui pour eux faisait pâlir celui du ciel. Étrange
puissance d'une idée et d'un désir! Rien ne semblait impossible à ces
deux êtres. Dans ces moments magiques où le plaisir jette ses reflets
jusque sur l'avenir, l'âme ne prévoit que du bonheur. Cette jolie
journée avait déjà créé pour tous deux des souvenirs auxquels ils ne
pouvaient rien comparer dans le passé de leur existence. La source
serait-elle donc plus gracieuse que le fleuve, le désir serait-il plus
ravissant que la jouissance, et ce qu'on espère plus attrayant que tout
ce qu'on possède?
--Voilà donc la journée déjà finie! Cette exclamation échappait à
l'inconnu au moment où cessait la danse, et Caroline le regarda d'un air
compatissant en lui voyant reprendre une légère teinte de tristesse.
--Pourquoi ne seriez-vous pas aussi content à Paris qu'ici? dit-elle. Le
bonheur n'est-il qu'à Saint-Leu? Il me semble maintenant que je ne puis
être malheureuse nulle part.
L'inconnu tressaillit à ces paroles dictées par ce doux abandon qui
entraîne toujours les femmes plus loin qu'elles ne veulent aller, de
même que la pruderie leur donne souvent plus de cruauté qu'elles n'en
ont. Pour la première fois, depuis le regard qui avait en quelque sorte
commencé leur amitié, Caroline et Roger eurent une même pensée; s'ils ne
l'exprimèrent pas, ils la sentirent au même moment par une mutuelle
impression, semblable à celle d'un bienfaisant foyer qui les aurait
consolés des atteintes de l'hiver; puis, comme s'ils eussent craint leur
silence, ils se rendirent alors à l'endroit où leur modeste voiture les
attendait; mais avant d'y monter, ils se prirent fraternellement par la
main, et coururent dans une allée sombre devant madame Crochard. Quand
ils ne virent plus le blanc bonnet de tulle qui leur indiquait la
vieille mère comme un point à travers les feuilles:--Caroline! dit
Roger d'une voix troublée et le coeur palpitant. La jeune fille confuse
recula de quelques pas en comprenant les désirs que cette interrogation
révélait; néanmoins, elle tendit sa main qui fut baisée avec ardeur et
qu'elle retira vivement, car en se levant sur la pointe des pieds elle
avait aperçu sa mère. Madame Crochard fit semblant de ne rien voir,
comme si, par un souvenir de ses anciens rôles, elle eût dû ne figurer
là qu'en _a parte_.
L'aventure de ces deux jeunes gens ne se continua pas long-temps dans la
rue du Tourniquet. Pour retrouver Caroline et Roger, il est nécessaire
de se transporter au milieu du Paris moderne, où il existe, dans les
maisons nouvellement bâties, de ces appartements qui semblent faits
exprès pour que de nouveaux mariés y passent leur lune de miel: les
peintures et les papiers y sont jeunes comme les époux, et la décoration
en est dans sa fleur comme leur amour; tout y est en harmonie avec de
jeunes idées, avec de bouillants désirs. Au milieu de la rue Taitbout,
dans une maison dont la pierre de taille était encore blanche, dont les
colonnes du vestibule et de la porte n'avaient encore aucune souillure,
et dont les murs reluisaient de cette peinture d'un blanc de plomb que
nos premières relations avec l'Angleterre mettaient à la mode, se
trouvait, au second étage, un petit appartement arrangé par l'architecte
comme s'il en avait deviné la destination. Une simple et fraîche
antichambre, revêtue en stuc à hauteur d'appui, donnait entrée dans un
salon et dans une petite salle à manger. Le salon communiquait à une
jolie chambre à coucher à laquelle attenait une salle de bain. Les
cheminées y étaient toutes garnies de hautes glaces encadrées avec
recherche. Les portes avaient pour ornements des arabesques de bon goût,
et les corniches étaient d'un style pur. Un amateur aurait reconnu là,
mieux qu'ailleurs, cette science de distribution et de décor qui
distingue les oeuvres de nos architectes modernes. Cet appartement était
habité depuis un mois environ par Caroline pour qui l'un de ces
tapissiers qui ne travaillent que guidés par les artistes, l'avait
meublé soigneusement. La description succincte de la pièce la plus
importante suffira pour donner une idée des merveilles que cet
appartement avait présentées à celle qui vint s'y installer, amenée par
Roger. Des tentures en étoffe grise, égayées par des agréments en soie
verte, décoraient les murs de sa chambre à coucher. Les meubles,
couverts en casimir clair, avaient les formes gracieuses et légères
ordonnées par le dernier caprice de la mode: une commode en bois
indigène incrustée de filets bruns, gardait les trésors de la parure; un
secrétaire pareil servait à écrire de doux billets sur un papier
parfumé; le lit, drapé à l'antique, ne pouvait inspirer que des idées de
volupté par la mollesse de ses mousselines élégamment jetées; les
rideaux, de soie grise à franges vertes, étaient toujours étendus de
manière à intercepter le jour; une pendule de bronze représentait
l'Amour couronnant Psyché; enfin, un tapis à dessins gothiques imprimés
sur un fond rougeâtre faisait ressortir les accessoires de ce lieu plein
de délices. En face d'une psyché se trouvait une petite toilette, devant
laquelle l'ex-brodeuse s'impatientait de la science de Plaisir, un
illustre coiffeur.
--Espérez-vous finir ma coiffure aujourd'hui? dit-elle.
--Madame a les cheveux si longs et si épais, répondit Plaisir.
Caroline ne put s'empêcher de sourire. La flatterie de l'artiste avait
sans doute réveillé dans son coeur le souvenir des louanges passionnées
que lui adressait son ami sur la beauté d'une chevelure qu'il
idolâtrait. Le coiffeur parti, la femme de chambre vint tenir conseil
avec elle sur la toilette qui plairait le plus à Roger. On était alors
au commencement de septembre 1816, il faisait froid: une robe de
grenadine verte garnie en chinchilla fut choisie. Aussitôt sa toilette
terminée, Caroline s'élança vers le salon, y ouvrit une croisée qui
donnait sur l'élégant balcon dont la façade de la maison était décorée
et se croisa les bras en s'appuyant sur une rampe en fer bronzé; elle
resta là dans une attitude charmante, non pour s'offrir à l'admiration
des passants et leur voir tourner la tête vers elle, mais pour regarder
la petite portion de boulevard qu'elle pouvait apercevoir au bout de la
rue Taitbout. Cette échappée de vue, que l'on comparerait volontiers au
trou pratiqué pour les acteurs dans un rideau de théâtre, lui permettait
de distinguer une multitude de voitures élégantes et une foule de monde
emportées avec la rapidité des ombres chinoises. Ignorant si Roger
viendrait à pied ou en voiture, l'ancienne ouvrière de la rue du
Tourniquet examinait tour à tour les piétons et les tilburys, voitures
légères récemment importées en France par les Anglais. Des expressions
de mutinerie et d'amour passaient sur sa jeune figure quand, après un
quart d'heure d'attente, son oeil perçant ou son coeur ne lui avaient
pas encore fait reconnaître celui qu'elle savait devoir venir. Quel
mépris, quelle insouciance se peignaient sur son beau visage pour toutes
les créatures qui s'agitaient comme des fourmis sous ses pieds! ses yeux
gris, pétillants de malice, étincelaient. Elle était là pour elle-même,
sans se douter que tous les jeunes gens emportaient milles confus désirs
à l'aspect de ses formes attrayantes. Elle évitait leurs hommages avec
autant de soin que les plus fières en mettent à les recueillir pendant
leurs promenades à Paris, et ne s'inquiétait certes guère si le souvenir
de sa blanche figure penchée ou de son petit pied qui dépassait le
balcon, si la piquante image de ses yeux animés et de son nez
voluptueusement retroussé, s'effaceraient ou non le lendemain du coeur
des passants qui l'avaient admirée: elle ne voyait qu'une figure et
n'avait qu'une idée. Quand la tête mouchetée d'un certain cheval
bai-brun vint à dépasser la haute ligne tracée dans l'espace par les
maisons, Caroline tressaillit et se haussa sur la pointe des pieds pour
tâcher de reconnaître les guides blanches et la couleur du tilbury.
C'était _lui_! Roger tourne l'angle de la rue, voit le balcon, fouette
son cheval qui s'élance et arrive à cette porte bronzée à laquelle il
est aussi habitué que son maître. La porte de l'appartement fut ouverte
d'avance par la femme de chambre, qui avait entendu le cri de joie jeté
par sa maîtresse; Roger se précipita vers le salon, pressa Caroline dans
ses bras, et l'embrassa avec cette effusion de sentiment que provoquent
toujours les réunions peu fréquentes de deux êtres qui s'aiment; il
l'entraîna, ou plutôt ils marchèrent par une volonté unanime, quoique
enlacés dans les bras l'un de l'autre, vers cette chambre discrète et
embaumée; une causeuse les reçut devant le foyer, et ils se
contemplèrent un moment en silence, en n'exprimant leur bonheur que par
les vives étreintes de leurs mains, en se communiquant leurs pensées par
un long regard.
--Oui, c'est lui, dit-elle enfin; oui, c'est toi. Sais-tu que voici
trois grands jours que je ne t'ai vu, un siècle! Mais qu'as-tu? tu as du
chagrin.
--Ma pauvre Caroline...
--Oh! voilà, ma pauvre Caroline...
--Non, ne ris pas, mon ange; nous ne pouvons pas aller ce soir à
Feydeau.
Caroline fit une petite mine boudeuse, mais qui se dissipa tout à coup.
--Je suis une sotte! Comment puis-je penser au spectacle quand je te
vois? Te voir, n'est-ce pas le seul spectacle que j'aime? s'écria-t-elle
en passant ses doigts dans les cheveux de Roger.
--Je suis obligé d'aller chez le procureur-général, car nous avons en ce
moment une affaire épineuse. Il m'a rencontré dans la grande salle; et
comme c'est moi qui porte la parole, il m'a engagé à venir dîner avec
lui; mais, ma chérie, tu peux aller à Feydeau avec ta mère, je vous y
rejoindrai si la conférence finit de bonne heure.
--Aller au spectacle sans toi, s'écria-t-elle avec une expression
d'étonnement, ressentir un plaisir que tu ne partagerais pas!... Oh! mon
Roger, vous mériteriez de ne pas être embrassé, ajouta-t-elle en lui
sautant au cou par un mouvement aussi naïf que voluptueux.
--Caroline, il faut que je rentre m'habiller. Le Marais est loin, et
j'ai encore quelques affaires à terminer.
--Monsieur, reprit Caroline en l'interrompant, prenez garde à ce que
vous dites là! Ma mère m'a averti que, quand les hommes commencent à
nous parler de leurs affaires, ils ne nous aiment plus.
--Caroline, ne suis-je pas venu? n'ai-je pas dérobé cette heure à mon
impitoyable...?
--Chut, dit-elle en mettant un doigt sur la bouche de Roger, chut, ne
vois-tu pas que je me moque!
En ce moment ils étaient revenus tous les deux dans le salon, Roger y
aperçut un meuble apporté le matin même par l'ébéniste: le vieux métier
en bois de rose dont le produit nourrissait Caroline et sa mère quand
elles habitaient la rue du Tourniquet-Saint-Jean, avait été remis à
neuf, et une robe de tulle d'un riche dessin y était déjà tendue.
--Eh bien, mon bon ami, ce soir je travaillerai. En brodant, je me
croirai encore à ces premiers jours où tu passais devant moi sans mot
dire, mais non sans me regarder; à ces jours où le souvenir de tes
regards me tenait éveillée pendant la nuit. O mon cher métier, le plus
beau meuble de mon salon, quoiqu'il ne me vienne pas de toi!--Tu ne sais
pas, dit-elle en s'asseyant sur les genoux de Roger qui ne pouvant
résister à ses émotions était tombé dans un fauteuil... Écoute-moi donc?
je veux donner aux pauvres tout ce que je gagnerai avec ma broderie. Tu
m'as faite si riche! Combien j'aime cette jolie terre de Bellefeuille,
moins pour ce qu'elle est que parce que c'est toi qui me l'as donnée.
Mais, dis-moi, mon Roger, je voudrais m'appeler Caroline de
Bellefeuille, le puis-je? tu dois le savoir: est-ce légal ou toléré?
Il fit une petite moue d'affirmation qui lui était suggérée par sa haine
pour le nom de Crochard, et Caroline sauta légèrement en frappant ses
mains l'une contre l'autre.
--Il me semble, s'écria-t-elle, que je t'appartiendrai bien mieux ainsi.
Ordinairement une fille renonce à son nom et prend celui de son
mari..... Une idée importune qu'elle chassa aussitôt la fit rougir, elle
prit Roger par la main, et le mena devant un piano ouvert.--Écoute,
dit-elle. Je sais maintenant ma sonate comme un ange. Et ses doigts
couraient déjà sur les touches d'ivoire, quand elle se sentit saisie et
enlevée par la taille.
--Caroline, je devrais être loin.
--Tu veux partir? eh! bien, va-t'en, dit-elle en boudant; mais elle
sourit après avoir regardé la pendule, et s'écria joyeusement:--Je
t'aurai toujours gardé un quart d'heure de plus.
--Adieu, mademoiselle de Bellefeuille, dit-il avec la douce ironie de
l'amour.
Après avoir pris un baiser, elle reconduisit son Roger jusque sur le
seuil de la porte. Quand le bruit de ses pas ne retentit plus dans
l'escalier, elle accourut sur le balcon pour le voir montant dans le
tilbury, pour lui voir en prendre les guides, pour recueillir un dernier
regard, entendre le coup de fouet, le roulement des roues sur le pavé,
et pour suivre des yeux le brillant cheval, le chapeau du maître, le
galon d'or qui garnissait celui du jockey, pour regarder même long-temps
encore après que l'angle noir de la rue lui eut dérobé cette vision.
Cinq ans après l'installation de mademoiselle Caroline de Bellefeuille
dans la jolie maison de la rue Taitbout, il s'y passa, pour la seconde
fois, une de ces scènes domestiques qui resserrent encore les liens
d'affection entre deux êtres qui s'aiment. Au milieu du salon bleu,
devant la fenêtre qui s'ouvrait sur le balcon, un petit garçon de quatre
ans et demi faisait un tapage infernal en fouettant le cheval de carton
sur lequel il était monté, et dont les deux arcs recourbés qui en
soutenaient les pieds n'allaient pas assez vite au gré du tapageur; sa
jolie petite tête à cheveux blonds, qui retombaient en mille boucles sur
une collerette brodée, sourit comme une figure d'ange à sa mère quand,
du fond d'une bergère, elle lui dit:--Pas tant de bruit, Charles, tu
vas réveiller ta petite soeur. Le curieux enfant descendit alors
brusquement de cheval, arriva sur la pointe des pieds comme s'il eût
craint le bruit de ses pas sur le tapis, mit un doigt entre ses petites
dents, demeura dans une de ces attitudes enfantines qui n'ont tant de
grâce que parce que tout en est naturel, et leva le voile de mousseline
blanche qui cachait le frais visage d'une petite fille endormie sur les
genoux de sa mère.
--Elle dort donc, Eugénie? dit-il tout étonné. Pourquoi donc qu'elle
dort quand nous sommes éveillés? ajouta-t-il en ouvrant de grands yeux
noirs qui flottaient dans un fluide abondant.
--Dieu seul sait cela, répondit Caroline en souriant.
La mère et l'enfant contemplèrent cette petite fille, baptisée le matin
même. Caroline, alors âgée d'environ vingt-quatre ans, offrait tous les
développements d'une beauté qu'un bonheur sans nuages et des plaisirs
constants avaient fait épanouir. En elle la femme était accomplie.
Charmée d'obéir aux désirs de son cher Roger, elle avait acquis les
connaissances qui lui manquaient, elle touchait assez bien du piano et
chantait agréablement. Ignorant les usages d'une société qui l'eût
repoussée et où elle ne serait point allée quand même on l'y aurait
accueillie, car la femme heureuse ne va pas dans le monde, elle n'avait
su ni prendre cette élégance de manières, ni apprendre cette
conversation pleine de mots et vide de pensées qui a cours dans les
salons; mais, en revanche, elle conquit laborieusement les connaissances
indispensables à une mère dont toute l'ambition consiste à bien élever
ses enfants. Ne pas quitter son fils, lui donner dès le berceau ces
leçons de tous les moments qui gravent en de jeunes âmes le goût du beau
et du bon, le préserver de toute influence mauvaise, remplir à la fois
les pénibles fonctions de la bonne et les douces obligations d'une mère,
tels furent ses uniques plaisirs.
Dès le premier jour, cette discrète et douce créature se résigna si bien
à ne point faire un pas hors de la sphère enchantée où pour elle se
trouvaient toutes ses joies, qu'après six ans de l'union la plus tendre,
elle ne connaissait encore à son ami que le nom de Roger. Placée dans sa
chambre à coucher, la gravure du tableau de Psyché arrivant avec sa
lampe pour voir l'Amour malgré sa défense, lui rappelait les conditions
de son bonheur. Pendant ces six années, ses modestes plaisirs ne
fatiguèrent jamais par une ambition mal placée le coeur de Roger, vrai
trésor de bonté. Jamais elle ne souhaita ni diamants ni parures, et
refusa le luxe d'une voiture vingt fois offerte à sa vanité. Attendre
sur le balcon la voiture de Roger, aller avec lui au spectacle ou se
promener ensemble pendant les beaux jours dans les environs de Paris,
l'espérer, le voir, et l'espérer encore, étaient l'histoire de sa vie,
pauvre d'événements, mais pleine d'amour.
En berçant sur ses genoux par une chanson la fille venue quelques mois
avant cette journée, elle se plut à évoquer les souvenirs du temps
passé. Elle s'arrêta plus volontiers sur les mois de septembre, époque à
laquelle chaque année son Roger l'emmenait à Bellefeuille y passer ces
beaux jours qui semblent appartenir à toutes les saisons. La nature est
alors aussi prodigue de fleurs que de fruits, les soirées sont tièdes,
les matinées sont douces, et l'éclat de l'été succède souvent à la
mélancolie de l'automne. Pendant les premiers temps de son amour, elle
avait attribué l'égalité d'âme et la douceur de caractère, dont tant de
preuves lui furent données par Roger, à la rareté de leurs entrevues
toujours désirées et à leur manière de vivre qui ne les mettait pas sans
cesse en présence l'un de l'autre, comme le sont deux époux. Elle se
souvint alors avec délices que, tourmentée de vaines craintes, elle
l'avait épié en tremblant pendant leur premier séjour à cette petite
terre du Gatinais. Inutile espionnage d'amour! chacun de ces mois de
bonheur passa comme un songe, au sein d'une félicité qui ne se démentit
jamais. Elle avait toujours vu à ce bon être un tendre sourire sur les
lèvres, sourire qui semblait être l'écho du sien. A ces tableaux trop
vivement évoqués, ses yeux se mouillèrent de larmes, elle crut ne pas
aimer assez et fut tentée de voir, dans le malheur de sa situation
équivoque, une espèce d'impôt mis par le sort sur son amour. Enfin, une
invincible curiosité lui fit chercher pour la millième fois les
événements qui pouvaient amener un homme aussi aimant que Roger à ne
jouir que d'un bonheur clandestin, illégal. Elle forgea mille romans,
précisément pour se dispenser d'admettre la véritable raison, depuis
longtemps devinée, mais à laquelle elle essaya de ne pas croire. Elle se
leva, tout en gardant son enfant endormi dans ses bras pour aller
présider, dans la salle à manger, à tous les préparatifs du dîner. Ce
jour était le 6 mai 1822, anniversaire de la promenade au parc de
Saint-Leu, pendant laquelle sa vie fut décidée; aussi chaque année, ce
jour ramenait-il une fête de coeur. Caroline désigna le linge qui devait
servir au repas et dirigea l'arrangement du dessert. Après avoir pris
avec bonheur les soins qui touchaient Roger, elle déposa la petite fille
dans sa jolie barcelonnette, vint se placer sur le balcon et ne tarda
pas à voir paraître le cabriolet par lequel son ami, parvenu à la
maturité de l'homme, avait remplacé l'élégant tilbury des premiers
jours. Après avoir essuyé le premier feu des caresses de Caroline et du
petit espiègle qui l'appelait papa, Roger alla au berceau, contempla le
sommeil de sa fille, la baisa sur le front, et tira de la poche de son
habit un long papier bariolé de lignes noires.
--Caroline, dit-il, voici la dot de mademoiselle Eugénie de
Bellefeuille.
La mère prit avec reconnaissance le titre dotal, une inscription au
grand-livre de la dette publique.
--Pourquoi trois mille francs de rente à Eugénie, quand tu n'as donné
que quinze cents francs à Charles?
--Charles, mon ange, sera un homme, répondit-il. Quinze cents francs lui
suffiront. Avec ce revenu, un homme courageux est au-dessus de la
misère. Si, par hasard, ton fils est un homme nul, je ne veux pas qu'il
puisse faire des folies. S'il a de l'ambition, cette modicité de fortune
lui inspirera le goût du travail. Eugénie est femme, il lui faut une
dot.
Le père se mit à jouer avec Charles dont les caressantes démonstrations
annonçaient l'indépendance et la liberté de son éducation. Aucune
crainte établie entre le père et l'enfant ne détruisait ce charme qui
récompense la paternité de ses obligations, et la gaieté de cette petite
famille était aussi douce que vraie. Le soir, une lanterne magique étala
sur une toile blanche ses piéges et ses mystérieux tableaux, à la grande
surprise de Charles. Plus d'une fois les joies célestes de cette
innocente créature excitèrent des fous rires sur les lèvres de Caroline
et de Roger. Quand, plus tard, le petit garçon fut couché, la petite
fille s'éveilla demandant sa limpide nourriture. A la clarté d'une
lampe, au coin du foyer, dans cette chambre de paix et de plaisir, Roger
s'abandonna donc au bonheur de contempler le tableau suave que lui
présentait cet enfant suspendu au sein de Caroline blanche, fraîche
comme un lis nouvellement éclos et dont les cheveux retombaient en
milliers de boucles brunes qui laissaient à peine voir son cou. La lueur
faisait ressortir toutes les grâces de cette jeune mère en multipliant
sur elle, autour d'elle, sur ses vêtements et sur l'enfant ces effets
pittoresques produits par les combinaisons de l'ombre et de la lumière.
Le visage de cette femme calme et silencieuse parut mille fois plus doux
que jamais à Roger, qui regarda tendrement ces lèvres chiffonnées et
vermeilles d'où jamais encore aucune parole discordante n'était sortie.
La même pensée brilla dans les yeux de Caroline qui examina Roger du
coin de l'oeil, soit pour jouir de l'effet qu'elle produisait sur lui,
soit pour deviner l'avenir de la soirée.
L'inconnu, qui comprit la coquetterie de ce regard fin, dit avec une
feinte tristesse:--Il faut que je parte. J'ai une affaire très-grave à
terminer, et l'on m'attend chez moi. Le devoir avant tout, n'est-ce pas,
ma chérie?
Caroline l'espionna d'un air à la fois triste et doux, mais avec cette
résignation qui ne laisse ignorer aucune des douleurs d'un
sacrifice:--Adieu, dit-elle. Va-t'en! Si tu restais une heure de plus,
je ne te donnerais pas facilement ta liberté.
--Mon ange, répondit-il alors en souriant, j'ai trois jours de congé, et
suis censé à vingt lieues de Paris.
Quelques jours après l'anniversaire de ce 6 mai, mademoiselle de
Bellefeuille accourut un matin dans la rue Saint-Louis, au Marais, en
souhaitant ne pas arriver trop tard dans une maison où elle se rendait
ordinairement tous les huit jours. Un exprès venait de lui apprendre que
sa mère, madame Crochard, succombait à une complication de douleurs
produites chez elle par ses catarrhes et par ses rhumatismes. Pendant
que le cocher de fiacre fouettait ses chevaux d'après une invitation
pressante que Caroline fortifia par la promesse d'un ample pour-boire,
les vieilles femmes timorées desquelles la veuve Crochard s'était fait
une société pendant ses derniers jours, introduisaient un prêtre dans
l'appartement commode et propre occupé par la vieille comparse au second
étage de la maison. La servante de madame Crochard ignorait que la jolie
demoiselle chez laquelle sa maîtresse allait souvent dîner fût sa propre
fille; et, l'une des premières, elle sollicita l'intervention d'un
confesseur, en espérant que cet ecclésiastique lui serait au moins aussi
utile qu'à la malade. Entre deux bostons, ou en se promenant au jardin
Turc, les vieilles femmes avec lesquelles la veuve Crochard caquetait
tous les jours, avaient réussi à réveiller dans le coeur glacé de leur
amie quelques scrupules sur sa vie passée, quelques idées d'avenir,
quelques craintes relatives à l'enfer, et certaines espérances de pardon
fondées sur un sincère retour à la religion. Dans cette solennelle
matinée, trois vieilles femmes de la rue Saint-François et de la
Vieille-Rue-du-Temple étaient donc venues s'établir dans le salon où
madame Crochard les recevait tous les mardis. A tour de rôle, l'une
d'elles quittait son fauteuil pour aller au chevet du lit tenir
compagnie à la pauvre vieille, et lui donner de ces faux espoirs avec
lesquels on berce les mourants. Cependant, quand la crise leur parut
prochaine, lorsque le médecin appelé la veille ne répondit plus de la
veuve, les trois dames se consultèrent pour décider s'il fallait avertir
mademoiselle de Bellefeuille. Françoise préalablement entendue, il fut
arrêté qu'un commissionnaire partirait pour la rue Taitbout prévenir la
jeune parente dont l'influence paraissait si redoutable aux quatre
femmes; mais elles espérèrent que l'Auvergnat ramènerait trop tard cette
personne dotée d'une si grande part dans l'affection de madame Crochard.
Cette veuve, évidemment riche d'un millier d'écus de rente, ne fut si
bien choyée par le trio femelle que parce qu'aucune de ces bonnes amies,
ni même Françoise, ne lui connaissaient d'héritier. L'opulence dont
jouissait mademoiselle de Bellefeuille, à qui madame Crochard
s'interdisait de donner le doux nom de fille par suite des _us_ de
l'ancien Opéra, légitimait presque le plan formé par ces quatre femmes
de se partager la succession de la mourante.
Bientôt celle des trois sibylles qui tenait la malade en arrêt vint
montrer une tête branlante au couple inquiet, et dit:--Il est temps
d'envoyer chercher monsieur l'abbé Fontanon. Encore deux heures, elle
n'aura ni sa tête, ni la force d'écrire un mot.
La vieille servante édentée partit donc, et revint avec un homme vêtu
d'une redingote noire. Un front étroit annonçait un petit esprit chez ce
prêtre, déjà doué d'une figure commune; ses joues larges et pendantes,
son menton doublé témoignaient d'un bien-être égoïste; ses cheveux
poudrés lui donnaient un air doucereux tant qu'il ne levait pas des yeux
bruns, petits, à fleur de tête, et qui n'eussent pas été mal placés sous
les sourcils d'un Tartare.
--Monsieur l'abbé, lui disait Françoise, je vous remercie bien de vos
avis; mais aussi, comptez que j'ai eu un fier soin de cette chère
femme-là.
La domestique au pas traînant et à la figure en deuil se tut en voyant
que la porte de l'appartement était ouverte, et que la plus insinuante
des trois douairières stationnait sur le palier pour être la première à
parler au confesseur. Quand l'ecclésiastique eut complaisamment essuyé
la triple bordée des discours mielleux et dévots des amies de la veuve,
il alla s'asseoir au chevet du lit de madame Crochard. La décence et une
certaine retenue forcèrent les trois dames et la vieille Françoise de
demeurer toutes quatre dans le salon à se faire des mines de douleur
qu'il n'appartenait qu'à ces faces ridées de jouer avec autant de
perfection.
--Ah! c'est-y malheureux! s'écria Françoise en poussant un soupir. Voilà
pourtant la quatrième maîtresse que j'aurai le chagrin d'enterrer. La
première m'a laissé cent francs de viager, la seconde cinquante écus, et
la troisième mille écus de comptant. Après trente ans de service, voilà
tout ce que je possède!
La servante usa de son droit d'aller et venir pour se rendre dans un
petit cabinet d'où elle pouvait entendre le prêtre.
--Je vois avec plaisir, disait Fontanon, que vous avez, ma fille, des
sentiments de piété; vous portez sur vous une sainte relique...
Madame Crochard fit un mouvement vague qui n'annonçait pas qu'elle eût
tout son bon sens, car elle montra la croix impériale de la
Légion-d'Honneur. L'ecclésiastique recula d'un pas en voyant la figure
de l'empereur; puis il se rapprocha bientôt de sa pénitente, qui
s'entretint avec lui d'un ton si bas que pendant quelque temps Françoise
n'entendit rien.
--Malédiction sur moi! s'écria tout à coup la vieille, ne m'abandonnez
pas. Comment, monsieur l'abbé, vous croyez que j'aurai à répondre de
l'âme de ma fille?
L'ecclésiastique parlait trop bas et la cloison était trop épaisse pour
que Françoise pût tout entendre.
--Hélas! s'écria la veuve en pleurant, le scélérat ne m'a rien laissé
dont je pusse disposer. En prenant ma pauvre Caroline, il m'a séparée
d'elle et ne m'a constitué que trois mille livres de rente dont le fonds
appartient à ma fille.
--Madame a une fille et n'a que du viager, cria Françoise en accourant
au salon.
Les trois vieilles se regardèrent avec un étonnement profond. Celle
d'entre elles dont le nez et le menton prêts à se joindre trahissaient
une sorte de supériorité d'hypocrisie et de finesse, cligna des yeux, et
dès que Françoise eut tourné le dos, elle fit à ses deux amies un signe
qui voulait dire:--Cette fille est une fine mouche, elle a déjà été
couchée sur trois testaments. Les trois vieilles femmes restèrent donc;
mais l'abbé reparut bientôt et quand il eut dit un mot, les sorcières
dégringolèrent de compagnie les escaliers après lui, laissant Françoise
seule avec sa maîtresse. Madame Crochard, dont les souffrances
redoublèrent cruellement, eut beau sonner en ce moment sa servante,
celle-ci se contentait de crier:--Eh! on y va! Tout à l'heure! Les
portes des armoires et des commodes allaient et venaient comme si
Françoise eût cherché quelque billet de loterie égaré. A l'instant où
cette crise atteignait à son dernier période, mademoiselle de
Bellefeuille arriva auprès du lit de sa mère pour lui prodiguer de
douces paroles.
--Oh! ma pauvre mère, combien je suis criminelle! Tu souffres, et je ne
le savais pas, mon coeur ne me le disait pas! Mais me voici...
--Caroline...
--Quoi?
--Elles m'ont amené un prêtre.
--Mais un médecin donc, reprit mademoiselle de Bellefeuille. Françoise,
un médecin! Comment ces dames n'ont-elles pas envoyé chercher le
docteur?
--Elles m'ont amené un prêtre, reprit la vieille en poussant un soupir.
--Comme elle souffre! et pas une potion calmante, rien sur sa table.
La mère fit un signe indistinct, mais que l'oeil pénétrant de Caroline
devina, car elle se tut pour la laisser parler.
--Elles m'ont amené un prêtre... soi-disant pour me confesser.--Prends
garde à toi, Caroline, lui cria péniblement la vieille comparse par un
dernier effort, le prêtre m'a arraché le nom de ton bienfaiteur.
--Et qui a pu te le dire, ma pauvre mère?
La vieille expira en essayant de prendre un air malicieux. Si
mademoiselle de Bellefeuille avait pu observer le visage de sa mère,
elle eût vu ce que personne ne verra, rire la Mort.
Pour comprendre l'intérêt que cache l'introduction de cette scène, il
faut en oublier un moment les personnages, pour se prêter au récit
d'événements antérieurs, mais dont le dernier se rattache à la mort de
madame Crochard. Ces deux parties formeront alors une même histoire qui,
par une loi particulière à la vie parisienne, avait produit deux actions
distinctes.
Vers la fin du mois de mars 1806, un jeune avocat, âgé d'environ
vingt-six ans, descendait vers trois heures du matin le grand escalier
de l'hôtel où demeurait l'Archi-Chancelier de l'Empire. Arrivé dans la
cour, en costume de bal, par une fine gelée, il ne put s'empêcher de
jeter une douloureuse exclamation où perçait néanmoins cette gaieté qui
abandonne rarement un Français, car il n'aperçut pas de fiacre à travers
les grilles de l'hôtel, et n'entendit dans le lointain aucun de ces
bruits produits par les sabots ou par la voix enrouée des cochers
parisiens. Quelques coups de pied frappés de temps en temps par les
chevaux du Grand-Juge que le jeune homme venait de laisser à la
bouillotte de Cambacérès retentissaient dans la cour de l'hôtel à peine
éclairée par les lanternes de la voiture. Tout à coup le jeune homme,
amicalement frappé sur l'épaule, se retourna, reconnut le Grand-Juge et
le salua. Au moment où le laquais dépliait le marche-pied du carrosse,
l'ancien législateur de la Convention devina l'embarras de l'avocat.
--La nuit tous les chats sont gris, lui dit-il gaiement. Le Grand-Juge
ne se compromettra pas en mettant un avocat dans son chemin! Surtout,
ajouta-t-il, si cet avocat est le neveu d'un ancien collègue, l'une des
lumières de ce grand Conseil-d'État qui a donné le Code Napoléon à la
France.
Le piéton monta dans la voiture sur un geste du chef suprême de la
justice impériale.
--Où demeurez-vous? demanda le ministre à l'avocat avant que la portière
ne fût refermée par le valet de pied qui attendait l'ordre.
--Quai des Augustins, monseigneur.
Les chevaux partirent, et le jeune homme se vit en tête-à-tête avec un
ministre auquel il avait tenté vainement d'adresser la parole avant et
après le somptueux dîner de Cambacérès, car le Grand-Juge l'avait
visiblement évité pendant toute la soirée.
--Eh! bien, monsieur _de_ Granville, vous êtes en assez beau chemin!
--Mais, tant que je serai à côté de Votre Excellence.....
--Je ne plaisante pas, dit le ministre. Votre stage est terminé depuis
deux ans, et vos défenses dans le procès Ximeuse et d'Hauteserre vous
ont placé bien haut.
--J'ai cru jusqu'aujourd'hui que mon dévouement à ces malheureux émigrés
me nuisait.
--Vous êtes bien jeune, dit le ministre d'un ton grave. Mais, reprit-il
après une pause, vous avez beaucoup plu ce soir à l'Archi-Chancelier.
Entrez dans la magistrature du parquet, nous manquons de sujets. Le
neveu d'un homme à qui Cambacérès et moi nous portons le plus vif
intérêt ne doit pas rester avocat faute de protection. Votre oncle nous
a aidés à traverser des temps bien orageux, et ces sortes de services ne
s'oublient pas.
Le ministre se tut pendant un moment.
--Avant peu, reprit-il, j'aurai trois places vacantes au tribunal de
première instance et à la cour impériale de Paris, venez alors me voir,
et choisissez celle qui vous conviendra. Jusque-là travaillez, mais ne
vous présentez point à mes audiences. D'abord, je suis accablé de
travail; puis vos concurrents devineraient vos intentions et pourraient
vous nuire auprès du patron. Cambacérès et moi en ne vous disant pas un
mot ce soir, nous vous avons garanti des dangers de la faveur.
Au moment où le ministre acheva ces derniers mots, la voiture s'arrêtait
sur le quai des Augustins, le jeune avocat remercia son généreux
protecteur avec une effusion de coeur assez vive des deux places qu'il
lui avait accordées, et se mit à frapper rudement à la porte, car la
bise sifflait avec rigueur sur ses mollets. Enfin un vieux portier tira
le cordon, et quand l'avocat passa devant la loge:--Monsieur Granville,
il y a une lettre pour vous, cria-t-il d'une voix enrouée.
Le jeune homme prit la lettre, et tâcha, malgré le froid, d'en lire
l'écriture à la lueur d'un pâle réverbère dont la mèche était sur le
point d'expirer.
--C'est de mon père! s'écria-t-il en prenant son bougeoir que le portier
finit par allumer. Et il monta rapidement dans son appartement pour y
lire la lettre suivante:
  «Prends le courrier, et si tu peux arriver promptement ici, ta fortune
  est faite. Mademoiselle Angélique Bontems a perdu sa soeur, la voilà
  fille unique, et nous savons qu'elle ne te hait pas. Maintenant,
  madame Bontems peut lui laisser à peu près quarante mille francs de
  rentes, outre ce qu'elle lui donnera en dot. J'ai préparé les voies.
  Nos amis s'étonneront de voir d'anciens nobles s'allier à la famille
  Bontems. Le père Bontems a été un bonnet rouge foncé qui possédait
  force biens nationaux achetés à vil prix. Mais d'abord il n'a eu que
  des prés de moines qui ne reviendront jamais; puis, si tu as déjà
  dérogé en te faisant avocat, je ne vois pas pourquoi nous reculerions
  devant une autre concession aux idées actuelles. La petite aura trois
  cent mille francs, je t'en donne cent, le bien de ta mère doit valoir
  cinquante mille écus ou à peu près, je te vois donc en position, mon
  cher fils, si tu veux te jeter dans la magistrature, de devenir
  sénateur tout comme un autre. Mon beau-frère le Conseiller d'État ne
  te donnera pas un coup de main pour cela, par exemple; mais, comme il
  n'est pas marié, sa succession te reviendra un jour: si tu n'étais pas
  sénateur de ton chef, tu aurais donc sa survivance. De là tu seras
  juché assez haut pour voir venir les événements. Adieu, je t'embrasse.
  «_F. comte de Granville._»
Le jeune de Granville se coucha donc en faisant mille projets plus beaux
les uns que les autres. Puissamment protégé par l'Archi-Chancelier, par
le Grand-Juge et par son oncle maternel, l'un des rédacteurs du Code, il
allait débuter dans un poste envié, devant la première Cour de l'Empire,
et se voyait membre de ce parquet où Napoléon choisissait les hauts
fonctionnaires de son Empire. Il se présentait de plus une fortune assez
brillante pour l'aider à soutenir son rang, auquel n'aurait pas suffi le
chétif revenu de cinq mille francs que lui donnait une terre recueillie
par lui dans la succession de sa mère.
Pour compléter ses rêves d'ambition par le bonheur, il évoqua la figure
naïve de mademoiselle Angélique Bontems, la compagne des jeux de son
enfance. Tant qu'il n'eut pas l'âge de raison, son père et sa mère ne
s'opposèrent point à son intimité avec la jolie fille de leur voisin de
campagne; mais quand, pendant les courtes apparitions que les vacances
lui laissaient faire à Bayeux, ses parents, entichés de noblesse,
s'aperçurent de son amitié pour la jeune fille, ils lui défendirent de
penser à elle. Depuis dix ans, Granville n'avait donc pu voir que par
moments celle qu'il nommait sa _petite femme_. Dans ces moments, dérobés
à l'active surveillance de leurs familles, à peine échangèrent-ils de
vagues paroles en passant l'un devant l'autre dans l'église ou dans la
rue. Leurs plus beaux jours furent ceux où, réunis par l'une de ces
fêtes champêtres nommées en Normandie des _assemblées_, ils
s'examinèrent furtivement et en perspective. Pendant ses dernières
vacances, Granville vit deux fois Angélique, et le regard baissé,
l'attitude triste de sa petite femme lui firent juger qu'elle était
courbée sous quelque despotisme inconnu.
Arrivé dès sept heures du matin au bureau des Messageries de la rue
Notre-Dame-des-Victoires, le jeune avocat trouva heureusement une place
dans la voiture qui partait à cette heure pour la ville de Caen.
L'avocat stagiaire ne revit pas sans une émotion profonde les clochers
de la cathédrale de Bayeux. Aucune espérance de sa vie n'ayant encore
été trompée, son coeur s'ouvrait aux beaux sentiments qui agitent de
jeunes âmes. Après le trop long banquet d'allégresse pour lequel il
était attendu par son père et par quelques amis, l'impatient jeune homme
fut conduit vers une certaine maison située rue Teinture, et bien connue
de lui. Le coeur lui battit avec force quand son père, que l'on
continuait d'appeler à Bayeux le comte de Granville, frappa rudement à
une porte cochère dont la peinture verte tombait par écailles. Il était
environ quatre heures du soir. Une jeune servante, coiffée d'un bonnet
de coton, salua les deux messieurs par une courte révérence, et répondit
que ces dames allaient bientôt revenir de vêpres.
Le comte et son fils entrèrent dans une salle basse servant de salon, et
semblable au parloir d'un couvent. Des lambris en noyer poli
assombrissaient cette pièce, autour de laquelle quelques chaises en
tapisserie et d'antiques fauteuils étaient symétriquement rangés. La
cheminée en pierre n'avait pour tout ornement qu'une glace verdâtre, de
chaque côté de laquelle sortaient les branches contournées de ces
anciens candélabres fabriqués à l'époque de la paix d'Utrecht. Sur la
boiserie en face de cette cheminée, le jeune Granville aperçut un énorme
crucifix d'ébène et d'ivoire entouré de buis bénit. Quoiqu'éclairée par
trois croisées qui tiraient leur jour d'un jardin de province dont les
carrés symétriques étaient dessinés par de longues raies de buis, la
pièce en recevait si peu de jour, qu'à peine voyait-on sur la muraille
parallèle à ces croisées trois tableaux d'église dus à quelque savant
pinceau, et achetés sans doute pendant la révolution par le vieux
Bontems, qui, en sa qualité de chef du district, n'oublia jamais ses
intérêts. Depuis le plancher, soigneusement ciré, jusqu'aux rideaux de
toile à carreaux verts, tout brillait d'une propreté monastique.
Involontairement le coeur du jeune homme se serra dans cette silencieuse
retraite où vivait Angélique. La continuelle habitation des brillants
salons de Paris et le tourbillon des fêtes avaient facilement effacé les
existences sombres et paisibles de la province dans le souvenir de
Granville, aussi le contraste fut-il pour lui si subit, qu'il éprouva
une sorte de frémissement intérieur. Sortir d'une assemblée chez
Cambacérès où la vie se montrait si ample, où les esprits avaient de
l'étendue, où la gloire impériale se reflétait vivement, et tomber tout
à coup dans un cercle d'idées mesquines, n'était-ce pas être transporté
de l'Italie au Groënland?
--Vivre ici, ce n'est pas vivre, se dit-il en examinant ce salon de
méthodiste.
Le vieux comte, qui s'aperçut de l'étonnement de son fils, alla le
prendre par la main, l'entraîna devant une croisée d'où venait encore un
peu de jour, et pendant que la servante allumait les vieilles bougies
des flambeaux, il essaya de dissiper les nuages que cet aspect amassait
sur son front.
--Écoute, mon enfant, lui dit-il, la veuve du père Bontems est
furieusement dévote. Quand le diable devint vieux... tu sais! Je vois
que l'air du bureau te fait faire la grimace. Eh bien, voici la vérité.
La vieille femme est assiégée par les prêtres, ils lui ont persuadé
qu'il était toujours temps de gagner le ciel, et pour être plus sûre
d'avoir saint Pierre et ses clefs, elle les achète. Elle va à la messe
tous les jours, entend tous les offices, communie tous les dimanches que
Dieu fait, et s'amuse à restaurer les chapelles. Elle a donné à la
cathédrale tant d'ornements, d'aubes, de chapes; elle a chamarré le dais
de tant de plumes, qu'à la procession de la dernière Fête-Dieu il y
avait une foule comme à une pendaison pour voir les prêtres
magnifiquement habillés et leurs ustensiles dorés à neuf. Aussi, cette
maison est-elle une vraie terre-sainte. C'est moi qui ai empêché la
vieille folle de donner ces trois tableaux à l'église, un Dominiquin, un
Corrége et un André del Sarto qui valent beaucoup d'argent.
--Mais Angélique, demanda vivement le jeune homme?
--Si tu ne l'épouses pas, Angélique est perdue, dit le comte. Nos bons
apôtres lui ont conseillé de vivre vierge et martyre. J'ai eu toutes les
peines du monde à réveiller son petit coeur en lui parlant de toi,
quand je l'ai vue fille unique; mais tu comprends aisément qu'une fois
mariée, tu l'emmèneras à Paris. Là, les fêtes, le mariage, la comédie et
l'entraînement de la vie parisienne lui feront facilement oublier les
confessionnaux, les jeûnes, les cilices et les messes dont se
nourrissent exclusivement ces créatures.
--Mais les cinquante mille livres de rentes provenues des biens
ecclésiastiques ne retourneront-elles pas...
--Nous y voilà, s'écria le comte d'un air fin. En considération du
mariage, car la vanité de madame Bontems n'a pas été peu chatouillée par
l'idée d'enter les Bontems sur l'arbre généalogique des Granville, la
susdite mère donne sa fortune en toute propriété à la petite, en ne s'en
réservant que l'usufruit. Aussi le sacerdoce s'oppose-t-il à ton
mariage; mais j'ai fait publier les bans, tout est prêt, et en huit
jours tu seras hors des griffes de la mère ou de ses abbés. Tu
posséderas la plus jolie fille de Bayeux, une petite commère qui ne te
donnera pas de chagrin, parce que ça aura des principes. Elle a été
mortifiée, comme ils disent dans leur jargon, par les jeûnes, par les
prières, et ajouta-t-il à voix basse, par sa mère.
Un coup frappé discrètement à la porte imposa silence au comte, qui crut
voir entrer les deux dames. Un petit domestique à l'air affairé se
montra; mais, intimidé par l'aspect des deux personnages, il fit un
signe à la bonne qui vint près de lui. Vêtu d'un gilet de drap bleu à
petites basques qui flottaient sur ses hanches, et d'un pantalon rayé
bleu et blanc, ce garçon avait les cheveux coupés en rond: sa figure
ressemblait à celle d'un enfant de choeur, tant elle peignait cette
componction forcée que contractent tous les habitants d'une maison
dévote.
--Mademoiselle Gatienne, savez-vous où sont les livres pour l'office de
la Vierge? Les dames de la congrégation du Sacré-Coeur font ce soir une
procession dans l'église.
Gatienne alla chercher les livres.
--Y en a-t-il encore pour long-temps, mon petit milicien, demanda le
comte.
--Oh! pour une demi-heure au plus.
--Allons voir ça, il y a de jolies femmes, dit le père à son fils.
D'ailleurs, une visite à la cathédrale ne peut pas nous nuire.
Le jeune avocat suivit son père d'un air irrésolu.
--Qu'as-tu donc? lui demanda le comte.
--J'ai, mon père, j'ai... que j'ai raison.
--Tu n'as encore rien dit.
--Oui, mais j'ai pensé que vous avez conservé dix mille livres de rente
de votre ancienne fortune, vous me les laisserez le plus tard possible,
je le désire; mais si vous me donnez cent mille francs pour faire un sot
mariage, vous me permettrez de ne vous en demander que cinquante mille
pour éviter un malheur et jouir, tout en restant garçon, d'une fortune
égale à celle que pourrait m'apporter votre demoiselle Bontems.
--Es-tu fou?
--Non, mon père. Voici le fait: le Grand-Juge m'a promis avant-hier une
place au parquet de Paris. Cinquante mille francs, joints à ce que je
possède et aux appointements de ma place, me feront un revenu de douze
mille francs. J'aurai, certes alors, des chances de fortune mille fois
préférables à celles d'une alliance aussi pauvre de bonheur qu'elle est
riche en biens.
--On voit bien, répondit le père en souriant, que tu n'as pas vécu dans
l'ancien régime. Est-ce que nous sommes jamais embarrassés d'une femme,
nous autres!...
--Mais, mon père, aujourd'hui le mariage est devenu...
--Ah çà! dit le comte en interrompant son fils, tout ce que mes vieux
camarades d'émigration me chantent est donc bien vrai? La révolution
nous a donc légué des moeurs sans gaieté, elle a donc empesté les jeunes
gens de principes équivoques? Tout comme mon beau-frère le jacobin, tu
vas me parler de nation, de morale publique, de désintéressement. O mon
Dieu! sans les soeurs de l'empereur, que deviendrions-nous?
Ce vieillard encore vert, que les paysans de ses terres appelaient
toujours le seigneur de Granville, acheva ces paroles en entrant sous
les voûtes de la cathédrale. Nonobstant la sainteté des lieux, il
fredonna, tout en prenant de l'eau bénite, un air de l'opéra de _Rose et
Colas_, et guida son fils le long des galeries latérales de la nef, en
s'arrêtant à chaque pilier pour examiner dans l'église les rangées de
têtes qui s'y trouvaient alignées comme le sont des soldats à la parade.
L'office particulier du Sacré-Coeur allait commencer. Les dames
affiliées à cette congrégation étant placées près du choeur, le comte et
son fils se dirigèrent vers cette portion de la nef, et s'adossèrent à
l'un des piliers les plus obscurs, d'où ils purent apercevoir la masse
entière de ces têtes qui ressemblaient à une prairie émaillée de fleurs.
Tout à coup, à deux pas du jeune Granville, une voix plus douce qu'il
ne semblait possible à créature humaine de la posséder, détonna comme le
premier rossignol qui chante après l'hiver. Quoiqu'accompagnée de mille
voix de femmes et par les sons de l'orgue, cette voix remua ses nerfs
comme s'ils eussent été attaqués par les notes trop riches et trop vives
de l'harmonica. Le Parisien se retourna, vit une jeune personne dont la
figure était, par suite de l'inclination de sa tête, entièrement
ensevelie sous un large chapeau d'étoffe blanche, et pensa que d'elle
seule venait cette claire mélodie; il crut reconnaître Angélique, malgré
la pelisse de mérinos brun qui l'enveloppait, et poussa le bras de son
père.
--Oui, c'est elle, dit le comte après avoir regardé dans la direction
que lui indiquait son fils.
Le vieux seigneur montra par un geste le visage pâle d'une vieille femme
dont les yeux fortement bordés d'un cercle noir avaient déjà vu les
étrangers sans que son regard faux eût paru quitter le livre de prières
qu'elle tenait.
Angélique leva la tête vers l'autel, comme pour aspirer les parfums
pénétrants de l'encens dont les nuages arrivaient jusqu'aux deux femmes.
A la lueur mystérieuse répandue dans ce sombre vaisseau par les cierges,
la lampe de la nef et quelques bougies allumées aux piliers, le jeune
homme aperçut alors une figure qui ébranla ses résolutions. Un chapeau
de moire blanche encadrait exactement un visage d'une admirable
régularité, par l'ovale que décrivait le ruban de satin noué sous un
petit menton à fossette. Sur un front étroit, mais très-mignon, des
cheveux couleur d'or pâle se séparaient en deux bandeaux et retombaient
autour des joues comme l'ombre d'un feuillage sur une touffe de fleurs.
Les deux arcs des sourcils étaient dessinés avec cette correction que
l'on admire dans les belles figures chinoises. Le nez, presque aquilin,
possédait une fermeté rare dans ses contours, et les deux lèvres
ressemblaient à deux lignes roses tracées avec amour par un pinceau
délicat. Les yeux, d'un bleu pâle, exprimaient la candeur. Si Granville
remarqua dans ce visage une sorte de rigidité silencieuse, il put
l'attribuer aux sentiments de dévotion qui animaient alors Angélique.
Les saintes paroles de la prière passaient entre deux rangées de perles
d'où le froid permettait de voir sortir comme un nuage de parfums.
Involontairement le jeune homme essaya de se pencher pour respirer cette
haleine divine. Ce mouvement attira l'attention de la jeune fille, et
son regard fixe élevé vers l'autel se tourna sur Granville, que
l'obscurité ne lui laissa voir qu'indistinctement, mais en qui elle
reconnut le compagnon de son enfance: un souvenir plus puissant que la
prière vint donner un éclat surnaturel à son visage, elle rougit.
L'avocat tressaillit de joie en voyant les espérances de l'autre vie
vaincues par les espérances de l'amour, et la gloire du sanctuaire
éclipsée par des souvenirs terrestres; mais son triomphe dura peu:
Angélique abaissa son voile, prit une contenance calme, et se remit à
chanter sans que le timbre de sa voix accusât la plus légère émotion.
Granville se trouva sous la tyrannie d'un seul désir et toutes ses idées
de prudence s'évanouirent. Quand l'office fut terminé, son impatience
était déjà devenue si grande, que, sans laisser les deux dames retourner
seules chez elles, il vint aussitôt saluer sa petite femme. Une
reconnaissance timide de part et d'autre se fit sous le porche de la
cathédrale, en présence des fidèles. Madame Bontems trembla d'orgueil en
prenant le bras du comte de Granville, qui, forcé de le lui offrir
devant tant de monde, sut fort mauvais gré à son fils d'une impatience
si peu décente.
Pendant environ quinze jours qui s'écoulèrent entre la présentation
officielle du jeune vicomte de Granville comme prétendu de mademoiselle
Bontems, et le jour solennel de son mariage, il vint assidûment trouver
son amie dans le sombre parloir, auquel il s'accoutuma. Ses longues
visites eurent pour but d'épier le caractère d'Angélique, car sa
prudence s'était heureusement réveillée le lendemain de son entrevue. Il
surprit presque toujours sa future assise devant une petite table en
bois de Sainte-Lucie, et occupée à marquer elle-même le linge qui devait
composer son trousseau. Angélique ne parla jamais la première de
religion. Si le jeune avocat se plaisait à jouer avec le riche chapelet
contenu dans un petit sac en velours vert, s'il contemplait en riant la
relique qui accompagne toujours cet instrument de dévotion, Angélique
lui prenait doucement le chapelet des mains en lui jetant un regard
suppliant, et, sans mot dire, le remettait dans le sac qu'elle serrait
aussitôt. Si parfois Granville se hasardait malicieusement à déclamer
contre certaines pratiques de la religion, la jolie Normande l'écoutait
en lui opposant le sourire de la conviction.
--Il ne faut rien croire, ou croire tout ce que l'Église enseigne,
répondit-elle. Voudriez-vous pour la mère de vos enfants, d'une fille
sans religion? non. Quel homme oserait être juge entre les incrédules et
Dieu? Eh! bien, comment puis-je blâmer ce que l'Église admet?
Angélique semblait animée par une si onctueuse charité, le jeune avocat
lui voyait tourner sur lui des regards si pénétrés qu'il fut parfois
tenté d'embrasser la religion de sa prétendue; la conviction profonde où
elle était de marcher dans le vrai sentier réveilla dans le coeur du
futur magistrat des doutes qu'elle essayait d'exploiter. Granville
commit alors l'énorme faute de prendre les prestiges du désir pour ceux
de l'amour. Angélique fut si heureuse de concilier la voix de son coeur
et celle du devoir en s'abandonnant à une inclination conçue dès son
enfance, que l'avocat trompé ne put savoir laquelle de ces deux voix
était la plus forte. Les jeunes gens ne sont-ils pas tous disposés à se
fier aux promesses d'un joli visage, à conclure de la beauté de l'âme
par celle des traits? un sentiment indéfinissable les porte à croire que
la perfection morale concorde toujours à la perfection physique. Si la
religion n'eût pas permis à Angélique de se livrer à ses sentiments, ils
se seraient bientôt séchés dans son coeur comme une plante arrosée d'un
acide mortel. Un amoureux aimé pouvait-il reconnaître un fanatisme si
bien caché? Telle fut l'histoire des sentiments du jeune Granville
pendant cette quinzaine dévorée comme un livre dont le dénouement
intéresse. Angélique attentivement épiée lui parut être la plus douce de
toutes les femmes, et il se surprit même à rendre grâce à madame
Bontems, qui, en lui inculquant si fortement des principes religieux,
l'avait en quelque sorte façonnée aux peines de la vie.
Au jour choisi pour la signature du fatal contrat, madame Bontems fit
solennellement jurer à son gendre de respecter les pratiques religieuses
de sa fille, de lui donner une entière liberté de conscience, de la
laisser communier, aller à l'église, à confesse, autant qu'elle le
voudrait, et de ne jamais la contrarier dans le choix de ses directeurs.
En ce moment solennel, Angélique contempla son futur d'un air si pur et
si candide, que Granville n'hésita pas à prêter le serment demandé. Un
sourire effleura les lèvres de l'abbé Fontanon, homme pâle qui dirigeait
les consciences de la maison. Par un léger mouvement de tête,
mademoiselle Bontems promit à son ami de ne jamais abuser de cette
liberté de conscience. Quant au vieux comte, il siffla tout bas l'air
de: _Va-t'en voir s'ils viennent!_
Après quelques jours accordés aux _retours de noce_ si fameux en
province, Granville et sa femme revinrent à Paris où le jeune avocat fut
appelé par sa nomination aux fonctions d'Avocat-Général près la cour
impériale de la Seine. Quand les deux époux y cherchèrent un
appartement, Angélique employa l'influence que la lune de miel prête à
toutes les femmes pour déterminer Granville à prendre un grand
appartement situé au rez-de-chaussée d'un hôtel qui faisait le coin de
la Vieille-Rue-du-Temple et de la rue Neuve-Saint-François. La
principale raison de son choix fut que cette maison se trouvait à deux
pas de la rue d'Orléans où il y avait une église, et voisine d'une
petite chapelle, sise rue Saint-Louis.
--Il est d'une bonne ménagère de faire des provisions, lui répondit son
mari en riant.
Angélique lui fit observer avec justesse que le quartier du Marais
avoisine le Palais de Justice, et que les magistrats qu'ils venaient de
visiter y demeuraient. Un jardin assez vaste donnait, pour un jeune
ménage, du prix à l'appartement: les enfants, _si le Ciel leur en
envoyait_, pourraient y prendre l'air, la cour était spacieuse, les
écuries étaient belles. L'Avocat-Général désirait habiter un hôtel de la
Chaussée-d'Antin où tout est jeune et vivant, où les modes apparaissent
dans leur nouveauté, où la population des boulevards est élégante, d'où
il y a moins de chemin à faire pour gagner les spectacles et rencontrer
des distractions; mais il fut obligé de céder aux patelineries d'une
jeune femme qui réclamait une première grâce, et pour lui complaire il
s'enterra dans le Marais. Les fonctions de Granville nécessitèrent un
travail d'autant plus assidu qu'il fut nouveau pour lui, il s'occupa
donc avant tout de l'ameublement de son cabinet et de l'emménagement de
sa bibliothèque; il s'installa promptement dans une pièce bientôt
encombrée de dossiers, et laissa sa jeune femme diriger la décoration de
la maison. Il jeta d'autant plus volontiers Angélique dans l'embarras
des premières acquisitions de ménage, source de tant de plaisirs et de
souvenirs pour les jeunes femmes, qu'il fut honteux de la priver de sa
présence plus souvent que ne le voulaient les lois de la lune de miel.
Une fois au fait de son travail, l'Avocat-Général permit à sa femme de
le prendre par le bras, de le tirer hors de son cabinet, et de
l'emmener pour lui montrer l'effet des ameublements et des décorations
qu'il n'avait encore vus qu'en détail ou par parties. S'il est vrai,
d'après un adage, qu'on puisse juger une femme en voyant la porte de sa
maison, les appartements doivent traduire son esprit avec encore plus de
fidélité. Soit que madame de Granville eût accordé sa confiance à des
tapissiers sans goût, soit qu'elle eût inscrit son propre caractère dans
un monde de choses ordonné par elle, le jeune magistrat fut surpris de
la sécheresse et de la froide solennité qui régnaient dans ses
appartements: il n'y aperçut rien de gracieux, tout y était discord,
rien ne récréait les yeux. L'esprit de rectitude et de petitesse
empreint dans le parloir de Bayeux revivait dans son hôtel, sous de
larges lambris circulairement creusés et ornés de ces arabesques dont
les longs filets contournés sont de si mauvais goût. Dans le désir
d'excuser sa femme, le jeune homme revint sur ses pas, examina de
nouveau la longue antichambre haute d'étage par laquelle on entrait dans
l'appartement: la couleur des boiseries demandée au peintre par sa femme
était trop sombre, et le velours d'un vert très-foncé qui couvrait les
banquettes ajoutait au sérieux de cette pièce, peu importante il est
vrai, mais qui donne toujours l'idée d'une maison, de même qu'on juge
l'esprit d'un homme sur sa première phrase. Une antichambre est une
espèce de préface qui doit tout annoncer, mais ne rien promettre. Le
jeune substitut se demanda si sa femme avait pu choisir la lampe à
lanterne antique qui se trouvait au milieu de cette salle nue, pavée
d'un marbre blanc et noir, décorée d'un papier où étaient simulées des
assises de pierres sillonnées çà et là de mousse verte. Un riche mais
vieux baromètre était accroché au milieu d'une des parois, comme pour en
mieux faire sentir le vide. A cet aspect, le jeune homme regarda sa
femme, il la vit si contente des galons rouges qui bordaient les rideaux
de percale, si contente du baromètre et de la statue décente, ornement
d'un grand poêle gothique, qu'il n'eut pas le barbare courage de
détruire de si fortes illusions. Au lieu de condamner sa femme,
Granville se condamna lui-même, il s'accusa d'avoir manqué à son premier
devoir, qui lui commandait de guider à Paris les premiers pas d'une
jeune fille élevée à Bayeux.
Sur cet échantillon, qui ne devinerait pas la décoration des autres
pièces? Que pouvait-on attendre d'une jeune femme qui prenait l'alarme
en voyant les jambes nues d'une cariatide, qui repoussait avec vivacité
un candélabre, un flambeau, un meuble, dès qu'elle y apercevait la
nudité d'un torse égyptien? A cette époque l'école de David arrivait à
l'apogée de sa gloire, tout se ressentait en France de la correction de
son dessin et de son amour pour les formes antiques qui fit en quelque
sorte de sa peinture une sculpture coloriée. Aucune de toutes les
inventions du luxe impérial n'obtint droit de bourgeoisie chez madame de
Granville. L'immense salon carré de son hôtel conserva le blanc et l'or
fanés qui l'ornaient au temps de Louis XV, et où l'architecte avait
prodigué les grilles en losanges et ces insupportables festons dus à la
stérile fécondité des crayons de cette époque. Si l'harmonie eût régné
du moins, si les meubles eussent fait affecter à l'acajou moderne les
formes contournées mises à la mode par le goût corrompu de Boucher, la
maison d'Angélique n'aurait offert que le plaisant contraste de jeunes
gens vivant au dix-neuvième siècle comme s'ils eussent appartenu au
dix-huitième; mais une foule de choses y produisaient des antithèses
ridicules pour les yeux. Les consoles, les pendules, les flambeaux
représentaient ces attributs guerriers que les triomphes de l'Empire
rendirent si chers à Paris. Ces casques grecs, ces épées romaines
croisées, les boucliers dus à l'enthousiasme militaire et qui décoraient
les meubles les plus pacifiques, ne s'accordaient guère avec les
délicates et prolixes arabesques, délices de madame de Pompadour. La
dévotion porte à je ne sais quelle humilité fatigante qui n'exclut pas
l'orgueil. Soit modestie, soit penchant, madame de Granville semblait
avoir horreur des couleurs douces et claires. Peut-être aussi
pensa-t-elle que la pourpre et le brun convenaient à la dignité du
magistrat. Mais, comment une jeune fille accoutumée à une vie austère
aurait-elle pu concevoir ces voluptueux divans qui inspirent de
mauvaises pensées, ces boudoirs élégants et perfides où s'ébauchent les
péchés? Le pauvre magistrat fut désolé. Au ton d'approbation par lequel
il souscrivit aux éloges que sa femme se donnait elle-même, elle
s'aperçut que rien ne plaisait à son mari. Elle manifesta tant de
chagrin de n'avoir pas réussi, que l'amoureux Granville vit une preuve
d'amour dans cette peine profonde, au lieu d'y voir une blessure faite à
l'amour-propre. Une jeune fille subitement arrachée à la médiocrité des
idées de province, inhabile aux coquetteries, à l'élégance de la vie
parisienne, pouvait-elle donc mieux faire? Le magistrat préféra croire
que les choix de sa femme avaient été dominés par les fournisseurs,
plutôt que de s'avouer la vérité. Moins amoureux, il eût senti que les
marchands, prompts à deviner l'esprit de leurs chalands, avaient béni le
Ciel de leur avoir envoyé une jeune dévote sans goût, pour les aider à
se débarrasser des choses passées de mode. Il consola donc sa jolie
Normande.
--Le bonheur, ma chère Angélique, ne nous vient pas d'un meuble plus ou
moins élégant, il dépend de la douceur, de la complaisance et de l'amour
d'une femme.
--Mais c'est mon devoir de vous aimer, et jamais devoir ne me plaira
tant à accomplir, reprit doucement Angélique.
La nature a mis dans le coeur de la femme un tel désir de plaire, un tel
besoin d'amour, que, même chez une jeune dévote, les idées d'avenir et
de salut doivent succomber sous les premières joies de l'hyménée. Aussi,
depuis le mois d'avril, époque à laquelle ils s'étaient mariés, jusqu'au
commencement de l'hiver, les deux époux vécurent-ils dans une parfaite
union. L'amour et le travail ont la vertu de rendre un homme assez
indifférent aux choses extérieures. Obligé de passer au Palais la moitié
de la journée, appelé à débattre les graves intérêts de la vie ou de la
fortune des hommes, Granville put moins qu'un autre apercevoir certaines
choses dans l'intérieur de son ménage. Si, le vendredi, sa table se
trouva servie en maigre, si par hasard il demanda sans l'obtenir un plat
de viande, sa femme, à qui l'Évangile interdisait tout mensonge, sut
néanmoins par de petites ruses permises dans l'intérêt de la religion,
rejeter son dessein prémédité sur son étourderie ou sur le dénûment des
marchés; elle se justifia souvent aux dépens du cuisinier et alla
quelquefois jusqu'à le gronder. A cette époque les jeunes magistrats
n'observaient pas comme aujourd'hui les jeûnes, les quatre-temps et les
veilles de fêtes, ainsi Granville ne remarqua point d'abord la
périodicité de ces repas maigres que sa femme eut d'ailleurs le soin
perfide de rendre très-délicats au moyen de sarcelles, de poules d'eau,
de pâtés au poisson dont les chairs amphibies ou l'assaisonnement
trompaient le goût. Le magistrat vécut donc très-orthodoxement sans le
savoir et fit son salut incognito. Les jours ordinaires, il ignorait si
sa femme allait ou non à la messe; les dimanches, par une condescendance
assez naturelle il l'accompagnait à l'église, comme pour lui tenir
compte de ce qu'elle lui sacrifiait quelquefois les vêpres. Les
spectacles étant insupportables en été à cause des chaleurs, Granville
n'eut pas même l'occasion d'une pièce à succès pour proposer à sa femme
de la mener à la comédie. Ainsi la grave question du théâtre ne fut pas
agitée. Enfin, dans les premiers moments d'un mariage auquel un homme a
été déterminé par la beauté d'une jeune fille, il lui est difficile de
se montrer exigeant dans ses plaisirs. La jeunesse est plus gourmande
que friande, et d'ailleurs la possession seule est un charme. Comment
reconnaîtrait-on la froideur, la dignité ou la réserve d'une femme quand
on lui prête l'exaltation que l'on sent, quand elle se colore du feu
dont on est animé? Il faut arriver à une certaine tranquillité conjugale
pour voir qu'une dévote attend l'amour les bras croisés. Granville se
crut donc assez heureux jusqu'au moment où un événement funeste vint
influer sur les destinées de son mariage.
Au mois de novembre 1807, le chanoine de la cathédrale de Bayeux, qui
jadis dirigeait les consciences de madame Bontems et de sa fille, vint à
Paris, amené par l'ambition de parvenir à l'une des cures de la
capitale, poste qu'il envisageait peut-être comme le marche-pied d'un
évêché. En ressaisissant son ancien empire sur son ouaille, il frémit de
la trouver déjà si changée par l'air de Paris et voulut la ramener dans
son froid bercail. Effrayée par les remontrances de l'ex-chanoine, homme
de trente-huit ans environ, qui apportait au milieu du clergé de Paris,
si tolérant et si éclairé, cette âpreté du catholicisme provincial,
cette inflexible bigoterie dont les exigences multipliées sont autant de
liens pour les âmes timorées, madame de Granville fit pénitence et
revint à son jansénisme.
Il serait fatigant de peindre avec exactitude les incidents qui
amenèrent insensiblement le malheur au sein de ce ménage, il suffira
peut-être de raconter les principaux faits sans les ranger
scrupuleusement par époque et par ordre. Cependant, la première
mésintelligence de ces jeunes époux fut assez frappante. Quand Granville
conduisit sa femme dans le monde, elle ne fit aucune difficulté d'aller
aux réunions graves, aux dîners, aux concerts, aux assemblées des
magistrats placés au-dessus de son mari par la hiérarchie judiciaire;
mais elle sut, pendant quelque temps, prétexter des migraines toutes les
fois qu'il s'agissait d'un bal. Un jour, Granville, impatienté de ces
indispositions de commande, supprima la lettre qui annonçait un bal chez
un Conseiller d'État, il trompa sa femme par une invitation verbale, et
dans une soirée où sa santé n'avait rien d'équivoque, il la produisit
au milieu d'une fête magnifique.
--Ma chère, lui dit-il au retour en lui voyant un air triste qui
l'offensa, votre condition de femme, le rang que vous occupez dans le
monde et la fortune dont vous jouissez vous imposent des obligations
qu'aucune loi divine ne saurait abroger. N'êtes-vous pas la gloire de
votre mari? Vous devez donc venir au bal quand j'y vais, et y paraître
convenablement.
--Mais, mon ami, qu'avait donc ma toilette de si malheureux?
--Il s'agit de votre air, ma chère. Quand un jeune homme vous parle et
vous aborde, vous devenez si sérieuse, qu'un plaisant pourrait croire à
la fragilité de votre vertu. Vous semblez craindre qu'un sourire ne vous
compromette. Vous aviez vraiment l'air de demander à Dieu le pardon des
péchés qui pouvaient se commettre autour de vous. Le monde, mon cher
ange, n'est pas un couvent. Mais puisque tu parles de toilette, je
t'avouerai que c'est aussi un devoir pour toi de suivre les modes et les
usages du monde.
--Voudriez-vous que je montrasse mes formes comme ces femmes effrontées
qui se décollètent de manière à laisser plonger des regards impudiques
sur leurs épaules nues, sur...
--Il y a de la différence, ma chère, dit le substitut en l'interrompant,
entre découvrir tout le buste et donner de la grâce à son corsage. Vous
avez un triple rang de ruches de tulle qui vous enveloppent le cou
jusqu'au menton. Il semble que vous ayez sollicité votre couturière
d'ôter toute forme gracieuse à vos épaules et aux contours de votre
sein, avec autant de soin qu'une coquette en met à obtenir de la sienne
des robes qui dessinent les formes les plus secrètes. Votre buste est
enseveli sous des plis si nombreux, que tout le monde se moquait de
votre réserve affectée. Vous souffririez si je vous répétais les
discours saugrenus que l'on a tenus sur vous.
--Ceux à qui ces obscénités plaisent ne seront pas chargés du poids de
nos fautes, répondit sèchement la jeune femme.
--Vous n'avez pas dansé, demanda Granville.
--Je ne danserai jamais, répliqua-t-elle.
--Si je vous disais que vous devez danser, reprit vivement le magistrat.
Oui, vous devez suivre les modes, porter des fleurs dans vos cheveux,
mettre des diamants. Songez donc, ma belle, que les gens riches, et nous
le sommes, sont obligés d'entretenir le luxe dans un état! Ne vaut-il
pas mieux faire prospérer les manufactures que de répandre son argent
en aumônes par les mains du clergé?
--Vous parlez en homme d'état, dit Angélique.
--Et vous en homme d'église, répondit-il vivement.
La discussion devint très-aigre. Madame Granville mit dans ses réponses,
toujours douces et prononcées d'un son de voix aussi clair que celui
d'une sonnette d'église, un entêtement qui trahissait une influence
sacerdotale. Quand, en réclamant les droits que lui constituait la
promesse de Granville, elle dit que son confesseur lui défendait
spécialement d'aller au bal, le magistrat essaya de lui prouver que ce
prêtre outrepassait les règlements de l'Église. Cette dispute odieuse,
théologique, fut renouvelée avec beaucoup plus de violence et d'aigreur
de part et d'autre quand Granville voulut mener sa femme au spectacle.
Enfin, le magistrat, dans le seul but de battre en brèche la pernicieuse
influence exercée sur sa femme par l'ex-chanoine, engagea la querelle de
manière à ce que madame de Granville, mise au défi, écrivit en cour de
Rome sur la question de savoir si une femme pouvait, sans compromettre
son salut, se décolleter, aller au bal et au spectacle pour complaire à
son mari. La réponse du vénérable Pie VII ne tarda pas, elle condamnait
hautement la résistance de la femme, et blâmait le confesseur. Cette
lettre, véritable catéchisme conjugal, semblait avoir été dictée par la
voix tendre de Fénelon dont la grâce et la douceur y respiraient.
  «Une femme est bien partout où la conduit son époux. Si elle commet
  des péchés par son ordre, ce ne sera pas à elle à en répondre un
  jour.»
Ces deux passages de l'homélie du pape le firent accuser d'irréligion
par madame de Granville et par son confesseur. Mais avant que le bref
n'arrivât, le substitut s'aperçut de la stricte observance des lois
ecclésiastiques que sa femme lui imposait les jours maigres, et il
ordonna à ses gens de lui servir du gras pendant toute l'année. Quelque
déplaisir que cet ordre causât à sa femme, Granville, qui du gras et du
maigre se souciait fort peu, le maintint avec une fermeté virile. La
plus faible créature vivante et pensante n'est-elle pas blessée dans ce
qu'elle a de plus cher quand elle accomplit, par l'instigation d'une
autre volonté que la sienne, une chose qu'elle eût naturellement faite.
De toutes les tyrannies, la plus odieuse est celle qui ôte
perpétuellement à l'âme le mérite de ses actions et de ses pensées: on
abdique sans avoir régné. La parole la plus douce à prononcer, le
sentiment le plus doux à exprimer, expirent quand nous les croyons
commandés. Bientôt le jeune magistrat en arriva à renoncer à recevoir
ses amis, à donner une fête ou un dîner: sa maison semblait s'être
couverte d'un crêpe. Une maison dont la maîtresse est dévote prend un
aspect tout particulier. Les domestiques, toujours placés sous la
surveillance de la femme, ne sont choisis que parmi ces personnes
soi-disant pieuses qui ont des figures à elles. De même que le garçon le
plus jovial entré dans la gendarmerie aura le visage gendarme, de même
les gens qui s'adonnent aux pratiques de la dévotion contractent un
caractère de physionomie uniforme; l'habitude de baisser les yeux, de
garder une attitude de componction, les revêt d'une livrée hypocrite que
les fourbes savent prendre à merveille. Puis, les dévotes forment une
sorte de république, elles se connaissent toutes; les domestiques,
qu'elles se recommandent les unes aux autres, sont comme une race à part
conservée par elles à l'instar de ces amateurs de chevaux qui n'en
admettent pas un dans leurs écuries dont l'extrait de naissance ne soit
en règle. Plus les prétendus impies viennent à examiner une maison
dévote, plus ils reconnaissent alors que tout y est empreint de je ne
sais quelle disgrâce; ils y trouvent tout à la fois une apparence
d'avarice ou de mystère comme chez les usuriers, et cette humidité
parfumée d'encens qui refroidit l'atmosphère des chapelles. Cette
régularité mesquine, cette pauvreté d'idées que tout trahit, ne
s'exprime que par un seul mot, et ce mot est _bigoterie_. Dans ces
sinistres et implacables maisons, la bigoterie se peint dans les
meubles, dans les gravures, dans les tableaux: le parler y est bigot, le
silence est bigot et les figures sont bigotes. La transformation des
choses et des hommes en bigoterie est un mystère inexplicable, mais le
fait est là. Chacun peut avoir observé que les bigots ne marchent pas,
ne s'asseyent pas, ne parlent pas comme marchent, s'asseyent et parlent
les gens du monde; chez eux l'on est gêné, chez eux l'on ne rit pas,
chez eux la raideur, la symétrie règnent en tout, depuis le bonnet de la
maîtresse de la maison jusqu'à sa pelote aux épingles; les regards n'y
sont pas francs, les gens y semblent des ombres, et la dame du logis
paraît assise sur un trône de glace. Un matin, le pauvre Granville
remarqua avec douleur et tristesse tous les symptômes de la bigoterie
dans sa maison. Il se rencontre de par le monde certaines sociétés où
les mêmes effets existent sans être produits par les mêmes causes.
L'ennui trace autour de ces maisons malheureuses un cercle d'airain qui
renferme l'horreur du désert et l'infini du vide. Un ménage n'est pas
alors un tombeau, mais quelque chose de pire, un couvent. Au sein de
cette sphère glaciale, le magistrat considéra sa femme sans passion: il
remarqua, non sans une vive peine, l'étroitesse d'idées que trahissait
la manière dont les cheveux étaient implantés sur le front bas et
légèrement creusé; il aperçut dans la régularité si parfaite des traits
du visage je ne sais quoi d'arrêté, de rigide qui lui rendit bientôt
haïssable la feinte douceur par laquelle il fut séduit. Il devina qu'un
jour ces lèvres minces pourraient lui dire, un malheur arrivant: «C'est
pour ton bien, mon ami.» La figure de madame de Granville prit une
teinte blafarde, une expression sérieuse qui tuait la joie chez ceux qui
l'approchaient. Ce changement fut-il opéré par les habitudes ascétiques
d'une dévotion qui n'est pas plus la piété que l'avarice n'est
l'économie, était-il produit par la sécheresse naturelle aux âmes
bigotes? il serait difficile de prononcer: la beauté sans expression est
peut-être une imposture. L'imperturbable sourire que la jeune femme fit
contracter à son visage en regardant Granville, paraissait être chez
elle une formule jésuitique de bonheur par laquelle elle croyait
satisfaire à toutes les exigences du mariage; sa charité blessait, sa
beauté sans passion semblait une monstruosité à ceux qui la
connaissaient, et la plus douce de ses paroles impatientait; elle
n'obéissait pas à des sentiments, mais à des devoirs. Il est des défauts
qui, chez une femme, peuvent céder aux leçons fortes données par
l'expérience ou par un mari, mais rien ne peut combattre la tyrannie des
fausses idées religieuses. Une éternité bienheureuse à conquérir, mise
en balance avec un plaisir mondain, triomphe de tout et fait tout
supporter. N'est-ce pas l'égoïsme divinisé, le _moi_ par-delà le
tombeau? Aussi, le pape fut-il condamné au tribunal de l'infaillible
chanoine et de la jeune dévote. Ne pas avoir tort est un des sentiments
qui remplacent tous les autres chez ces âmes despotiques. Depuis quelque
temps, il s'était établi un secret combat entre les idées des deux
époux, et le jeune magistrat se fatigua bientôt d'une lutte qui ne
devait jamais cesser. Quel homme, quel caractère résiste à la vue d'un
visage amoureusement hypocrite, et à une remontrance catégorique opposée
aux moindres volontés? Quel parti prendre contre une femme qui se sert
de votre passion pour protéger son insensibilité, qui semble résolue à
rester doucement inexorable, se prépare à jouer le rôle de victime avec
délices, et regarde un mari comme un instrument de Dieu, comme un mal
dont les flagellations lui évitent celles du purgatoire? Quelles sont
les peintures par lesquelles on pourrait donner l'idée de ces femmes qui
font haïr la vertu en outrant les plus doux préceptes d'une religion que
saint Jean résumait par: Aimez-vous les uns les autres. Existait-il dans
un magasin de modes un seul chapeau condamné à rester en étalage ou à
partir pour les îles, Granville était sûr de voir sa femme s'en parer;
s'il se fabriquait une étoffe d'une couleur ou d'un dessin malheureux,
elle s'en affublait. Ces pauvres dévotes sont désespérantes dans leur
toilette. Le manque de goût est un des défauts qui sont inséparables de
la fausse dévotion. Ainsi, dans cette intime existence qui veut le plus
d'expansion, Granville fut sans compagne: il alla seul dans le monde,
dans les fêtes, au spectacle. Rien chez lui ne sympathisait avec lui. Un
grand crucifix placé entre le lit de sa femme et le sien était là comme
le symbole de sa destinée. Ne représente-t-il pas une divinité mise à
mort, un homme-dieu tué dans toute la beauté de la vie et de la
jeunesse? L'ivoire de cette croix avait moins de froideur qu'Angélique
crucifiant son mari au nom de la vertu. Ce fut entre leurs deux lits que
naquit le malheur: cette jeune femme ne voyait là que des devoirs dans
les plaisirs de l'hyménée. Là, par un mercredi des cendres se leva
l'observance des jeûnes, pâle et livide figure qui d'une voix brève
ordonna un carême complet, sans que Granville jugeât convenable d'écrire
cette fois au pape, afin d'avoir l'avis du consistoire sur la manière
d'observer le carême, les quatre-temps et les veilles de grandes fêtes.
Le malheur du jeune magistrat fut immense, il ne pouvait même pas se
plaindre, qu'avait-il à dire? il possédait une femme jeune, jolie,
attachée à ses devoirs, vertueuse, le modèle de toutes les vertus! elle
accouchait chaque année d'un enfant, les nourrissait tous elle-même et
les élevait dans les meilleurs principes. La charitable Angélique fut
promue ange. Les vieilles femmes qui composaient la société au sein de
laquelle elle vivait (car à cette époque les jeunes femmes ne s'étaient
pas encore avisées de se lancer par ton dans la haute dévotion),
admirèrent toutes le dévouement de madame de Granville, et la
regardèrent, sinon comme une vierge, au moins comme une martyre. Elles
accusaient, non pas les scrupules de la femme, mais la barbarie
procréatrice du mari. Insensiblement, Granville, accablé de travail,
sevré de plaisirs et fatigué du monde où il errait solitaire, tomba vers
trente-deux ans dans le plus affreux marasme. La vie lui fut odieuse.
Ayant une trop haute idée des obligations que lui imposait sa place pour
donner l'exemple d'une vie irrégulière, il essaya de s'étourdir par le
travail, et entreprit alors un grand ouvrage sur le droit. Mais il ne
jouit pas long-temps de cette tranquillité monastique sur laquelle il
comptait.
Lorsque la divine Angélique le vit désertant les fêtes du monde et
travaillant chez lui avec une sorte de régularité, elle essaya de le
convertir. Un véritable chagrin pour elle était de savoir à son mari des
opinions peu chrétiennes, elle pleurait quelquefois en pensant que si
son époux venait à périr, il mourrait dans l'impénitence finale, sans
que jamais elle pût espérer de l'arracher aux flammes éternelles de
l'enfer. Granville fut donc en butte aux petites idées, aux
raisonnements vides, aux étroites pensées par lesquels sa femme, qui
croyait avoir remporté une première victoire, voulut essayer d'en
obtenir une seconde en le ramenant dans le giron de l'Église. Ce fut là
le dernier coup. Quoi de plus affligeant que ces luttes sourdes où
l'entêtement des dévotes voulait l'emporter sur la dialectique d'un
magistrat? Quoi de plus effrayant à peindre que ces aigres pointilleries
auxquelles les gens passionnés préfèrent des coups de poignard?
Granville déserta sa maison, où tout lui devenait insupportable: ses
enfants, courbés sous le despotisme froid de leur mère, n'osaient suivre
leur père au spectacle, et Granville ne pouvait leur procurer aucun
plaisir sans leur attirer des punitions de leur terrible mère. Cet homme
si aimant fut amené à une indifférence, à un égoïsme pire que la mort.
Il sauva du moins ses fils de cet enfer en les mettant de bonne heure au
collége, et se réservant le droit de les diriger. Il intervenait
rarement entre la mère et les filles; mais il résolut de les marier
aussitôt qu'elles atteindraient l'âge de nubilité. S'il eût voulu
prendre un parti violent, rien ne l'aurait justifié; sa femme, appuyée
par un formidable cortége de douairières, l'aurait fait condamner par la
terre entière. Granville n'eut donc d'autre ressource que de vivre dans
un isolement complet; mais courbé sous la tyrannie du malheur, ses
traits flétris par le chagrin et par les travaux lui déplaisaient à
lui-même. Enfin, ses liaisons, son commerce avec les femmes du monde
auprès desquelles il désespéra de trouver des consolations, il les
redoutait.
L'histoire didactique de ce triste ménage n'offrit, pendant les treize
années qui s'écoulèrent de 1807 à 1821, aucune scène digne d'être
rapportée. Madame de Granville resta exactement la même du moment où
elle perdit le coeur de son mari que pendant les jours où elle se disait
heureuse. Elle fit des neuvaines pour prier Dieu et les saints de
l'éclairer sur les défauts qui déplaisaient à son époux et de lui
enseigner les moyens de ramener la brebis égarée; mais plus ses prières
avaient de ferveur, moins Granville paraissait au logis. Depuis cinq ans
environ, l'Avocat-Général, à qui la Restauration donna de hautes
fonctions dans la magistrature, s'était logé à l'entresol de son hôtel,
pour éviter de vivre avec la comtesse de Granville. Chaque matin il se
passait une scène qui, s'il faut en croire les médisances du monde, se
répète au sein de plus d'un ménage où elle est produite par certaines
incompatibilités d'humeur, par des maladies morales ou physiques, ou par
des travers qui conduisent bien des mariages aux malheurs retracés dans
cette histoire. Sur les huit heures du matin, une femme de chambre,
assez semblable à une religieuse, venait sonner à l'appartement du comte
de Granville. Introduite dans le salon qui précédait le cabinet du
magistrat, elle redisait au valet de chambre, et toujours du même ton,
le message de la veille.
--Madame fait demander à monsieur le comte s'il a bien passé la nuit, et
si elle aura le plaisir de déjeuner avec lui.
--Monsieur, répondait le valet de chambre après être allé parler à son
maître, présente ses hommages à madame la comtesse, et la prie d'agréer
ses excuses; une affaire importante l'oblige à se rendre au Palais.
Un instant après, la femme de chambre se présentait de nouveau, et
demandait de la part de madame si elle aurait le bonheur de voir
monsieur le comte avant son départ.--Il est parti, répondait le valet,
tandis que souvent le cabriolet était encore dans la cour.
Ce dialogue par ambassadeur devint un cérémonial quotidien. Le valet de
chambre de Granville, qui, favori de son maître, causa plus d'une
querelle dans le ménage par son irréligion et par le relâchement de ses
moeurs, se rendait même quelquefois par forme dans le cabinet où son
maître n'était pas, et revenait faire les réponses d'usage. L'épouse
affligée guettait toujours le retour de son mari, se mettait sur le
perron afin de se trouver sur son passage et arriver devant lui comme un
remords. La taquinerie vétilleuse qui anime les caractères monastiques
faisait le fond de celui de madame de Granville, qui, alors âgée de
trente-cinq ans, paraissait en avoir quarante. Quand, obligé par le
décorum, Granville adressait la parole à sa femme ou restait à dîner au
logis, heureuse de lui imposer sa présence, ses discours aigres-doux et
l'insupportable ennui de sa société bigote, elle essayait alors de le
mettre en faute devant ses gens et ses charitables amies. La présidence
d'une cour royale fut offerte au comte de Granville, alors très-bien en
cour, il pria le ministère de le laisser à Paris. Ce refus, dont les
raisons ne furent connues que du Garde-des-sceaux, suggéra les plus
bizarres conjectures aux intimes amies et au confesseur de la comtesse.
Granville, riche de cent mille livres de rente, appartenait à l'une des
meilleures maisons de la Normandie: sa nomination à une présidence était
un échelon pour arriver à la pairie; d'où venait ce peu d'ambition? d'où
venait l'abandon de son grand ouvrage sur le droit? d'où venait cette
dissipation qui, depuis près de six années, l'avait rendu étranger à sa
maison, à sa famille, à ses travaux, à tout ce qui devait lui être cher?
Le confesseur de la comtesse, qui pour parvenir à un évêché comptait
autant sur l'appui des maisons où il régnait que sur les services rendus
à une congrégation de laquelle il fut l'un des plus ardents
propagateurs, se trouva désappointé par le refus de Granville et tâcha
de le calomnier par des suppositions: si monsieur le comte avait tant de
répugnance pour la province, peut-être s'effrayait-il de la nécessité où
il serait d'y mener une conduite régulière? forcé de donner l'exemple
des bonnes moeurs, il vivrait avec la comtesse, de laquelle une passion
illicite pouvait seule l'éloigner? une femme aussi pure que madame de
Granville reconnaîtrait-elle jamais les dérangements survenus dans la
conduite de son mari?... Les bonnes amies transformèrent en vérités ces
paroles qui malheureusement n'étaient pas des hypothèses, et madame de
Granville fut frappée comme d'un coup de foudre. Sans idées sur les
moeurs du grand monde, ignorant l'amour et ses folies, Angélique était
si loin de penser que le mariage pût comporter des incidents différents
de ceux qui lui aliénèrent le coeur de Granville qu'elle le crut
incapable de fautes qui pour toutes les femmes sont des crimes. Quand le
comte ne réclama plus rien d'elle, elle avait imaginé que le calme dont
il paraissait jouir était dans la nature; enfin, comme elle lui avait
donné tout ce que son coeur pouvait renfermer d'affection pour un
homme, et que les conjectures de son confesseur ruinaient complétement
les illusions dont elle s'était nourrie jusqu'en ce moment, elle prit la
défense de son mari, mais sans pouvoir détruire un soupçon si habilement
glissé dans son âme. Ces appréhensions causèrent de tels ravages dans sa
faible tête qu'elle en tomba malade, et devint la proie d'une fièvre
lente. Ces événements se passaient pendant le carême de l'année 1822,
elle ne voulut pas consentir à cesser ses austérités, et arriva
lentement à un état de consomption qui fit trembler pour ses jours. Les
regards indifférents de Granville la tuaient. Les soins et les
attentions du magistrat ressemblaient à ceux qu'un neveu s'efforce de
prodiguer à un vieil oncle. Quoique la comtesse eût renoncé à son
système de taquinerie et de remontrances et qu'elle essayât d'accueillir
son mari par de douces paroles, l'aigreur de la dévote perçait et
détruisait souvent par un mot l'ouvrage d'une semaine.
Vers la fin du mois de mai, les chaudes haleines du printemps, un régime
plus nourrissant que celui du carême rendirent quelques forces à madame
de Granville. Un matin, au retour de la messe, elle vint s'asseoir dans
son petit jardin sur un banc de pierre où les caresses du soleil lui
rappelèrent les premiers jours de son mariage, elle embrassa sa vie d'un
coup d'oeil afin de voir en quoi elle avait pu manquer à ses devoirs de
mère et d'épouse. L'abbé Fontanon apparut alors dans une agitation
difficile à décrire.
--Vous serait-il arrivé quelque malheur, mon père, lui demanda-t-elle
avec une filiale sollicitude.
--Ah! je voudrais, répondit le prêtre normand, que toutes les infortunes
dont vous afflige la main de Dieu me fussent départies; mais, ma
respectable amie, c'est des épreuves auxquelles il faut savoir vous
soumettre.
--Eh! peut-il m'arriver des châtiments plus grands que ceux par lesquels
sa providence m'accable en se servant de mon mari comme d'un instrument
de colère?
--Préparez-vous, ma fille, à plus de mal encore que nous n'en supposions
jadis avec vos pieuses amies.
--Je dois alors remercier Dieu, répondit la comtesse, de ce qu'il daigne
se servir de vous pour me transmettre ses volontés, plaçant ainsi, comme
toujours, les trésors de sa miséricorde auprès des fléaux de sa colère,
comme jadis en bannissant Agar il lui découvrait une source dans le
désert.
--Il a mesuré vos peines à la force de votre résignation et au poids de
vos fautes.
--Parlez, je suis prête à tout entendre. A ces mots, la comtesse leva
les yeux au ciel, et ajouta: Parlez, monsieur Fontanon.
--Depuis sept ans, monsieur Granville commet le péché d'adultère avec
une concubine de laquelle il a deux enfants, et il a dissipé pour ce
ménage adultérin plus de cinq cent mille francs qui devraient appartenir
à sa famille légitime.
--Il faudrait que je le visse de mes propres yeux, dit la comtesse.
--Gardez-vous-en bien, s'écria l'abbé. Vous devez pardonner, ma fille,
et attendre, dans la prière, que Dieu éclaire votre époux, à moins
d'employer contre lui les moyens que vous offrent les lois humaines.
La longue conversation que l'abbé Fontanon eut alors avec sa pénitente
produisit un changement violent dans la comtesse; elle le congédia,
montra sa figure presque colorée à ses gens qui furent effrayés de son
activité de folle: elle commanda d'atteler ses chevaux, ordre qu'elle
donnait rarement; elle les décommanda, changea d'avis vingt fois dans la
même heure; mais enfin, comme si elle prenait une grande résolution,
elle partit sur les trois heures, laissant sa maison étonnée d'une si
subite révolution.
--Monsieur doit-il revenir dîner, avait-elle demandé au valet de chambre
à qui elle ne parlait jamais.
--Non, madame.
--L'avez-vous conduit au Palais ce matin?
--Oui, madame.
--N'est-ce pas aujourd'hui lundi?
--Oui, madame.
--On va donc maintenant au Palais le lundi.
--Que le diable t'emporte! s'écria le valet en voyant partir sa
maîtresse qui dit au cocher: rue Taitbout.
Mademoiselle de Bellefeuille était en deuil et pleurait. Auprès d'elle,
Roger tenait une des mains de son amie entre les siennes, gardait le
silence, et regardait tour à tour le petit Charles qui ne comprenant
rien au deuil de sa mère restait muet en la voyant pleurer, et le
berceau où dormait Eugénie, et le visage de Caroline sur lequel la
tristesse ressemblait à une pluie tombant à travers les rayons d'un
joyeux soleil.
--Eh bien! oui, mon ange, dit Roger après un long silence, voilà le
grand secret, je suis marié. Mais un jour, je l'espère, nous ne ferons
qu'une même famille. Ma femme est depuis le mois de mars dans un état
désespéré: je ne souhaite pas sa mort; mais, s'il plaît à Dieu de
l'appeler à lui, je crois qu'elle sera plus heureuse dans le paradis
qu'au milieu d'un monde dont ni les peines ni les plaisirs ne
l'affectent.
--Combien je hais cette femme! Comment a-t-elle pu te rendre malheureux?
Cependant c'est à ce malheur que je dois ma félicité.
Ses larmes se séchèrent tout à coup.
--Caroline, espérons, s'écria Roger en prenant un baiser. Ne t'effraie
pas de ce qu'a pu dire cet abbé. Quoique ce confesseur de ma femme soit
un homme redoutable par son influence dans la Congrégation, s'il
essayait de troubler notre bonheur, je saurais prendre un parti....
--Que ferais-tu?
--Nous irions en Italie, je fuirais...
Un cri, jeté dans le salon voisin, fit à la fois frissonner le comte de
Granville et trembler mademoiselle de Bellefeuille qui se précipitèrent
dans le salon et y trouvèrent la comtesse évanouie. Quand madame de
Granville reprit ses sens, elle soupira profondément en se voyant entre
le comte et sa rivale qu'elle repoussa par un geste involontaire plein
de mépris.
Mademoiselle de Bellefeuille se leva pour se retirer.
--Vous êtes chez vous, madame, restez, dit Granville en arrêtant
Caroline par le bras.
Le magistrat saisit sa femme mourante, la porta jusqu'à sa voiture, et y
monta près d'elle.
--Qui donc a pu vous amener à désirer ma mort, à me fuir, demanda la
comtesse d'une voix faible en contemplant son mari avec autant
d'indignation que de douleur. N'étais-je pas jeune, vous m'avez trouvée
belle, qu'avez-vous à me reprocher? Vous ai-je trompé, n'ai-je pas été
une épouse vertueuse et sage? Mon coeur n'a conservé que votre image,
mes oreilles n'ont entendu que votre voix. A quel devoir ai-je manqué,
que vous ai-je refusé?
--Le bonheur, répondit le comte d'une voix ferme. Vous le savez, madame,
il est deux manières de servir Dieu. Certains chrétiens s'imaginent
qu'en entrant à des heures fixes dans une église pour y dire des _Pater
noster_, en y entendant régulièrement la messe et s'abstenant de tout
péché, ils gagneront le ciel; ceux-là, madame, vont en enfer, ils n'ont
point aimé Dieu pour lui-même, ils ne l'ont point adoré comme il veut
l'être, ils ne lui ont fait aucun sacrifice. Quoique doux en apparence,
ils sont durs à leur prochain; ils voient la règle, la lettre, et non
l'esprit. Voilà comme vous en avez agi avec votre époux terrestre. Vous
avez sacrifié mon bonheur à votre salut, vous étiez en prières quand
j'arrivais à vous le coeur joyeux, vous pleuriez quand vous deviez
égayer mes travaux, vous n'avez su satisfaire à aucune exigence de mes
plaisirs.
--Et s'ils étaient criminels, s'écria la comtesse avec feu, fallait-il
donc perdre mon âme pour vous plaire?
--C'eût été un sacrifice qu'une autre plus aimante a eu le courage de me
faire, dit froidement Granville.
--O mon Dieu, s'écria-t-elle en pleurant, tu l'entends! Était-il digne
des prières et des austérités au milieu desquelles je me suis consumée
pour racheter ses fautes et les miennes? A quoi sert la vertu?
--A gagner le ciel, ma chère. On ne peut être à la fois l'épouse d'un
homme et celle de Jésus-Christ, il y aurait bigamie: il faut savoir
opter entre un mari et un couvent. Vous avez dépouillé votre âme au
profit de l'avenir, de tout l'amour, de tout le dévouement que Dieu vous
ordonnait d'avoir pour moi, et vous n'avez gardé au monde que des
sentiments de haine...
--Ne vous ai-je donc point aimé, demanda-t-elle.
--Non, madame.
--Qu'est-ce donc que l'amour, demanda involontairement la comtesse.
--L'amour, ma chère, répondit Granville avec une sorte de surprise
ironique, vous n'êtes pas en état de le comprendre. Le ciel froid de la
Normandie ne peut pas être celui de l'Espagne. Sans doute la question
des climats est le secret de notre malheur. Se plier à nos caprices, les
deviner, trouver des plaisirs dans une douleur, nous sacrifier l'opinion
du monde, l'amour-propre, la religion même, et ne regarder ces offrandes
que comme des grains d'encens brûlés en l'honneur de l'idole, voilà
l'amour...
--L'amour des filles de l'Opéra, dit la comtesse avec horreur. De tels
feux doivent être peu durables, et ne vous laisser bientôt que des
cendres ou des charbons, des regrets ou du désespoir. Une épouse,
monsieur, doit vous offrir, à mon sens, une amitié vraie, une chaleur
égale, et...
--Vous parlez de chaleur comme les nègres parlent de la glace, répondit
le comte avec un sourire sardonique. Songez que la plus humble de toutes
les pâquerettes est plus séduisante que la plus orgueilleuse et la plus
brillante des épines-roses qui nous attirent au printemps par leurs
pénétrants parfums et leurs vives couleurs. D'ailleurs, ajouta-t-il, je
vous rends justice. Vous vous êtes si bien tenue dans la ligne du devoir
apparent prescrit par la loi, que, pour vous démontrer en quoi vous avez
failli à mon égard, il faudrait entrer dans certains détails que votre
dignité ne saurait supporter, et vous instruire de choses qui vous
sembleraient le renversement de toute morale.
--Vous osez parler de morale en sortant de la maison où vous avez
dissipé la fortune de vos enfants, dans un lieu de débauche, s'écria la
comtesse que les réticences de son mari rendirent furieuse.
--Madame, je vous arrête là, dit le comte avec sang-froid en
interrompant sa femme. Si mademoiselle de Bellefeuille est riche, elle
ne l'est aux dépens de personne. Mon oncle était maître de sa fortune,
il avait plusieurs héritiers; de son vivant et par pure amitié pour
celle qu'il considérait comme une nièce, il lui a donné sa terre de
Bellefeuille. Quant au reste, je le tiens de ses libéralités...
--Cette conduite est digne d'un jacobin, s'écria la pieuse Angélique.
--Madame, vous oubliez que votre père fut un de ces jacobins que vous,
femme, condamnez avec si peu de charité, dit sévèrement le comte. Le
citoyen Bontems a signé des arrêts de mort dans le temps où mon oncle
n'a rendu que des services à la France.
Madame de Granville se tut. Mais après un moment de silence, le souvenir
de ce qu'elle venait de voir réveillant dans son âme une jalousie que
rien ne saurait éteindre dans le coeur d'une femme, elle dit à voix
basse et comme si elle se parlait à elle-même:--Peut-on perdre ainsi son
âme et celle des autres!
--Eh! madame, reprit le comte fatigué de cette conversation, peut-être
est-ce vous qui répondrez un jour de tout ceci. Cette parole fit
trembler la comtesse. Vous serez sans doute excusée aux yeux du juge
indulgent qui appréciera nos fautes, dit-il, par la bonne foi avec
laquelle vous avez accompli mon malheur. Je ne vous hais point, je hais
les gens qui ont faussé votre coeur et votre raison. Vous avez prié pour
moi, comme mademoiselle de Bellefeuille m'a donné son coeur et m'a
comblé d'amour. Vous deviez être tour à tour et ma maîtresse et la
sainte priant au pied des autels. Rendez-moi cette justice d'avouer que
je ne suis ni pervers ni débauché. Mes moeurs sont pures. Hélas! au bout
de sept années de douleur, le besoin d'être heureux m'a, par une pente
insensible, conduit à aimer une autre femme que vous, à me créer une
autre famille que la mienne. Ne croyez pas d'ailleurs que je sois le
seul: il existe dans cette ville des milliers de maris amenés tous par
des causes diverses à cette double existence.
--Grand Dieu! s'écria la comtesse, combien ma croix est devenue lourde à
porter. Si l'époux que tu m'as imposé dans ta colère ne peut trouver
ici-bas de félicité que par ma mort, rappelle-moi dans ton sein.
--Si vous aviez eu toujours de si admirables sentiments et ce
dévouement, nous serions encore heureux, dit froidement le comte.
--Eh bien! reprit Angélique en versant un torrent de larmes,
pardonnez-moi si j'ai pu commettre des fautes! Oui, monsieur, je suis
prête à vous obéir en tout, certaine que vous ne désirerez rien que de
juste et de naturel: je serai désormais tout ce que vous voudrez que
soit une épouse.
--Madame, si votre intention est de me faire dire que je ne vous aime
plus, j'aurai l'affreux courage de vous éclairer. Puis-je commander à
mon coeur, puis-je effacer en un instant les souvenirs de quinze années
de douleur? Je n'aime plus. Ces paroles enferment un mystère tout aussi
profond que celui contenu dans le mot j'aime. L'estime, la
considération, les égards s'obtiennent, disparaissent, reviennent; mais
quant à l'amour, je me prêcherais mille ans que je ne le ferais pas
renaître, surtout pour une femme qui s'est vieillie à plaisir.
--Ah! monsieur le comte, je désire bien sincèrement que ces paroles ne
vous soient pas prononcées un jour par celle que vous aimez, avec le ton
et l'accent que vous y mettez...
--Voulez-vous porter ce soir une robe à la grecque et venir à l'Opéra?
Le frisson que cette demande causa soudain à la comtesse fut une muette
réponse.
Dans les premiers jours du mois de décembre 1829, un homme dont les
cheveux entièrement blanchis et la physionomie semblaient annoncer qu'il
était plutôt vieilli par les chagrins que par les années, car il
paraissait avoir environ soixante ans, passait à minuit par la rue de
Gaillon. Arrivé devant une maison de peu d'apparence et haute de deux
étages, il s'arrêta pour y examiner une des fenêtres élevées en mansarde
à des distances égales au milieu de la toiture. Une faible lueur
colorait à peine cette humble croisée dont quelques-uns des carreaux
avaient été remplacés par du papier. Le passant regardait cette clarté
vacillante avec l'indéfinissable curiosité des flâneurs parisiens,
lorsqu'un jeune homme sortit tout à coup de la maison. Comme les pâles
rayons du réverbère frappaient la figure du curieux, il ne paraîtra pas
étonnant que, malgré la nuit, le jeune homme s'avançât vers le passant
avec ces précautions dont on use à Paris quand on craint de se tromper
en rencontrant une personne de connaissance.
--Hé quoi! s'écria-t-il, c'est vous, monsieur le président, seul, à
pied, à cette heure, et si loin de la rue Saint-Lazare! Permettez-moi
d'avoir l'honneur de vous offrir le bras. Le pavé, ce matin, est si
glissant que si nous ne nous soutenions pas l'un l'autre, dit-il afin de
ménager l'amour-propre du vieillard, il nous serait bien difficile
d'éviter une chute.
--Mais, mon cher monsieur, je n'ai encore que cinquante ans,
malheureusement pour moi, répondit le comte de Granville. Un médecin,
promis comme vous à une haute célébrité, doit savoir qu'à cet âge un
homme est dans toute sa force.
--Vous êtes donc alors en bonne fortune, reprit Horace Bianchon. Vous
n'avez pas, je pense, l'habitude d'aller à pied dans Paris. Quand on a
d'aussi beaux chevaux que les vôtres...
--Mais la plupart du temps, répondit le président Granville, quand je ne
vais pas dans le monde, je reviens du Palais-Royal ou de chez monsieur
de Livry à pied.
--Et en portant sans doute sur vous de fortes sommes, s'écria le jeune
docteur. N'est-ce pas appeler le poignard des assassins.
--Je ne crains pas ceux-là, répliqua le comte de Granville d'un air
triste et insouciant.
--Mais du moins l'on ne s'arrête pas, reprit le médecin en entraînant
le magistrat vers le boulevard. Encore un peu, je croirais que vous
voulez me voler votre dernière maladie et mourir d'une autre main que de
la mienne.
--Ah! vous m'avez surpris faisant de l'espionnage, répondit le comte.
Soit que je passe à pied ou en voiture et à telle heure que ce puisse
être de la nuit, j'aperçois depuis quelque temps à une fenêtre du
troisième étage de la maison d'où vous sortez l'ombre d'une personne qui
paraît travailler avec un courage héroïque. A ces mots le comte fit une
pause, comme s'il eût senti quelque douleur soudaine. J'ai pris pour ce
grenier, dit-il en continuant, autant d'intérêt qu'un bourgeois de Paris
peut en porter à l'achèvement du Palais-Royal.
--Hé bien! s'écria vivement Horace en interrompant le comte, je puis
vous...
--Ne me dites rien, répliqua Granville en coupant la parole à son
médecin. Je ne donnerais pas un centime pour apprendre si l'ombre qui
s'agite sur ces rideaux troués est celle d'un homme ou d'une femme, et
si l'habitant de ce grenier est heureux ou malheureux! Si j'ai été
surpris de ne plus voir personne travaillant ce soir, si je me suis
arrêté, c'était uniquement pour avoir le plaisir de former des
conjectures aussi nombreuses et aussi niaises que le sont celles que les
flâneurs forment à l'aspect d'une construction subitement abandonnée.
Depuis deux ans, mon jeune... Le comte parut hésiter à employer une
expression; mais il fit un geste et s'écria:--Non, je ne vous appellerai
pas mon ami, je déteste tout ce qui peut ressembler à un sentiment.
Depuis deux ans donc, je ne m'étonne plus que les vieillards se plaisent
tant à cultiver des fleurs, à planter des arbres; les événements de la
vie leur ont appris à ne plus croire aux affections humaines; et, en peu
de temps, je suis devenu vieillard. Je ne veux plus m'attacher qu'à des
animaux qui ne raisonnent pas, à des plantes, à tout ce qui est
extérieur. Je fais plus de cas des mouvements de la Taglioni que de tous
les sentiments humains. J'abhorre la vie et un monde où je suis seul.
Rien, rien, ajouta le comte avec une expression qui fit tressaillir le
jeune homme, non, rien ne m'émeut et rien ne m'intéresse.
--Vous avez des enfants?
--Mes enfants! reprit-il avec un singulier accent d'amertume. Eh bien!
l'aînée de mes deux filles n'est-elle pas comtesse de Vandenesse? Quant
à l'autre, le mariage de son aînée lui prépare une belle alliance. Quant
à mes deux fils, n'ont-ils pas très-bien réussi! le vicomte est
Avocat-Général à Limoges, et le cadet est substitut à Versailles. Mes
enfants ont leurs soins, leurs inquiétudes, leurs affaires. Si parmi ces
coeurs, un seul se fût entièrement consacré à moi, s'il eût essayé par
son affection de combler le vide que je sens là, dit-il en frappant sur
son sein, eh bien! celui-là aurait manqué sa vie, il me l'aurait
sacrifiée. Et pourquoi, après tout? pour embellir quelques années qui me
restent, y serait-il parvenu, n'aurai-je pas peut-être regardé ses soins
généreux comme une dette? Mais... Ici le vieillard se prit à sourire
avec une profonde ironie. Mais, docteur, ce n'est pas en vain que nous
leur apprenons l'arithmétique, et ils savent calculer. En ce moment, ils
attendent peut-être ma succession.
--Oh! monsieur le comte, comment cette idée peut-elle vous venir, à vous
si bon, si obligeant, si humain? En vérité, si je n'étais pas moi-même
une preuve vivante de cette bienfaisance que vous concevez si belle et
si large...
--Pour mon plaisir, reprit vivement le comte. Je paie une sensation
comme je paierais demain d'un monceau d'or la plus puérile des illusions
qui me remuait le coeur. Je secours mes semblables pour moi, par la même
raison que je vais au jeu; aussi ne compté-je sur la reconnaissance de
personne. Vous-même, je vous verrais mourir sans sourciller, et je vous
demande le même sentiment pour moi. Ah! jeune homme, les événements de
la vie ont passé sur mon coeur comme les laves du Vésuve sur Herculanum:
la ville existe, morte.
--Ceux qui ont amené à ce point d'insensibilité une âme aussi
chaleureuse et aussi vivante que l'était la vôtre, sont bien coupables.
--N'ajoutez pas un mot, reprit le comte avec un sentiment d'horreur.
--Vous avez une maladie que vous devriez me permettre de guérir, dit
Bianchon d'un son de voix plein d'émotion.
--Mais connaissez-vous donc un remède à la mort? s'écria le comte
impatienté.
--Hé bien, monsieur le comte, je gage ranimer ce coeur que vous croyez
si froid.
--Valez-vous Talma? demanda ironiquement le président.
--Non, monsieur le comte. Mais la nature est aussi supérieure à Talma,
que Talma pouvait m'être supérieur. Écoutez, le grenier qui vous
intéresse est habité par une femme d'une trentaine d'années, et, chez
elle, l'amour va jusqu'au fanatisme; l'objet de son culte est un jeune
homme d'une jolie figure, mais qu'une mauvaise fée a doué de tous les
vices possibles. Ce garçon est joueur, et je ne sais ce qu'il aime le
mieux des femmes ou du vin; il a fait, à ma connaissance, des bassesses
dignes de la police correctionnelle. Eh! bien, cette malheureuse femme
lui a sacrifié une très-belle existence, un homme par qui elle était
adorée, de qui elle avait des enfants. Mais qu'avez-vous, monsieur le
comte?
--Rien, continuez.
--Elle lui a laissé dévorer une fortune entière, elle lui donnerait, je
crois, le monde, si elle le tenait; elle travaille nuit et jour; et
souvent elle a vu, sans murmurer, ce monstre qu'elle adore lui ravir
jusqu'à l'argent destiné à payer les vêtements dont manquent ses
enfants, jusqu'à leur nourriture du lendemain. Il y a trois jours, elle
a vendu ses cheveux, les plus beaux que j'aie jamais vus: il est venu,
elle n'avait pas pu cacher assez promptement la pièce d'or, il l'a
demandée; pour un sourire, pour une caresse, elle a livré le prix de
quinze jours de vie et de tranquillité. N'est-ce pas à la fois horrible
et sublime? Mais le travail commence à lui creuser les joues. Les cris
de ses enfants lui ont déchiré l'âme, elle est tombée malade, elle gémit
en ce moment sur un grabat. Ce soir, elle n'avait rien à manger, et ses
enfants n'avaient plus la force de crier, ils se taisaient quand je suis
arrivé.
Horace Bianchon s'arrêta. En ce moment le comte de Granville avait,
comme malgré lui, plongé la main dans la poche de son gilet.
--Je devine, mon jeune ami, dit le vieillard, comment elle peut vivre
encore, si vous la soignez.
--Ah! la pauvre créature, s'écria le médecin, qui ne la secourrait pas?
Je voudrais être plus riche, car j'espère la guérir de son amour.
--Mais, reprit le comte en retirant de sa poche la main qu'il y avait
mise sans que le médecin la vît pleine des billets que son protecteur
semblait y avoir cherchés, comment voulez-vous que je m'apitoie sur une
misère dont les plaisirs ne me sembleraient pas payés trop cher par
toute ma fortune! Elle sent, elle vit cette femme. Louis XV n'aurait-il
pas donné tout son royaume pour pouvoir se relever de son cercueil et
avoir trois jours de jeunesse et de vie? N'est-ce pas là l'histoire d'un
milliard de morts, d'un milliard de malades, d'un milliard de
vieillards?
--Pauvre Caroline, s'écria le médecin.
En entendant ce nom, le comte de Granville tressaillit, et saisit le
bras du médecin qui crut se sentir serré par les deux lèvres en fer d'un
étau.
--Elle se nomme Caroline Crochard, demanda le président d'un son de voix
visiblement altérée.
--Vous la connaissez donc? répondit le docteur avec étonnement.
--Et le misérable se nomme Solvet... Ah! vous m'avez tenu parole,
s'écria l'ancien magistrat, vous avez agité mon coeur par la plus
terrible sensation qu'il éprouvera jusqu'à ce qu'il devienne poussière.
Cette émotion est encore un présent de l'enfer, et je sais toujours
comment m'acquitter avec lui.
En ce moment, le comte et le médecin étaient arrivés au coin de la rue
de la Chaussée-d'Antin. Un de ces enfants de la nuit, qui, le dos chargé
d'une hotte en osier et marchant un crochet à la main, ont été
plaisamment nommés, pendant la révolution, membres du comité des
recherches, se trouvait auprès de la borne devant laquelle le président
venait de s'arrêter. Ce chiffonnier avait une vieille figure digne de
celles que Charlet a immortalisées dans ses caricatures de l'école du
balayeur.
--Rencontres-tu souvent des billets de mille francs, lui demanda le
comte.
--Quelquefois, notre bourgeois.
--Et les rends-tu?
--C'est selon la récompense promise...
--Voilà mon homme, s'écria le comte en présentant au chiffonnier un
billet de mille francs. Prends ceci, lui dit-il, mais songe que je te le
donne à la condition de le dépenser au cabaret, de t'y enivrer, de t'y
disputer, de battre ta femme, de crever les yeux à tes amis. Cela fera
marcher la garde, les chirurgiens, les pharmaciens; peut-être les
gendarmes, les procureurs du roi, les juges et les geôliers. Ne change
rien à ce programme, ou le diable saurait tôt ou tard se venger de toi.
Il faudrait qu'un même homme possédât à la fois les crayons de Charlet
et ceux de Callot, les pinceaux de Téniers et de Rembrandt, pour donner
une idée vraie de cette scène nocturne.
--Voilà mon compte soldé avec l'enfer, et j'ai eu du plaisir pour mon
argent, dit le comte d'un son de voix profond en montrant au médecin
stupéfait la figure indescriptible du chiffonnier béant. Quant à
Caroline Crochard, reprit-il, elle peut mourir dans les horreurs de la
faim et de la soif, en entendant les cris déchirants de ses fils
mourants, en reconnaissant la bassesse de celui qu'elle aime: je ne
donnerais pas un denier pour l'empêcher de souffrir, et je ne veux plus
vous voir par cela seul que vous l'avez secourue...
Le comte laissa Bianchon plus immobile qu'une statue, et disparut en se
dirigeant avec la précipitation d'un jeune homme vers la rue
Saint-Lazare, où il atteignit promptement le petit hôtel qu'il habitait
et à la porte duquel il vit non sans surprise une voiture arrêtée.
--Monsieur le baron, dit le valet de chambre à son maître, est arrivé il
y a une heure pour parler à monsieur, et l'attend dans sa chambre à
coucher.
Granville fit signe à son domestique de se retirer.
--Quel motif assez important vous oblige d'enfreindre l'ordre que j'ai
donné à mes enfants de ne pas venir chez moi sans y être appelés? dit le
vieillard à son fils en entrant.
--Mon père, répondit le jeune homme d'un son de voix tremblant et d'un
air respectueux, j'ose espérer que vous me pardonnerez quand vous
m'aurez entendu.
--Votre réponse est celle d'un magistrat, dit le comte. Asseyez-vous. Il
montra un siége au jeune homme. Mais, reprit-il, que je marche ou que je
reste assis, ne vous occupez pas de moi.
--Mon père, reprit le baron, ce soir à quatre heures, un très-jeune
homme, arrêté chez un de mes amis au préjudice duquel il a commis un vol
assez considérable, s'est réclamé de vous, il se prétend votre fils.
--Il se nomme, demanda le comte en tremblant.
--Charles Crochard.
--Assez, dit le père en faisant un geste impératif. Granville se promena
dans la chambre, au milieu d'un profond silence que son fils se garda
bien d'interrompre.--Mon fils... Ces paroles furent prononcées d'un ton
si doux et si paternel que le jeune magistrat en tressaillit. Charles
Crochard vous a dit la vérité. Je suis content que tu sois venu ce soir,
mon bon Eugène, ajouta le vieillard. Voici une somme d'argent assez
forte, dit-il en lui présentant une masse de billets de banque, tu en
feras l'usage que tu jugeras convenable dans cette affaire. Je me fie à
toi, et j'approuve d'avance toutes tes dispositions, soit pour le
présent, soit pour l'avenir. Eugène, mon cher enfant, viens m'embrasser,
nous nous voyons peut-être pour la dernière fois. Demain je demande un
congé, je pars pour l'Italie. Si un père ne doit pas compte de sa vie à
ses enfants, il doit leur léguer l'expérience que lui a vendue le sort,
n'est-ce pas une partie de leur héritage? Quand tu te marieras, reprit
le comte en laissant échapper un frissonnement involontaire, n'accomplis
pas légèrement cet acte, le plus important de tous ceux auxquels nous
oblige la Société. Souviens-toi d'étudier long-temps le caractère de la
femme avec laquelle tu dois t'associer; mais consulte-moi, je veux la
juger moi-même. Le défaut d'union entre deux époux, par quelque cause
qu'il soit produit, amène d'effroyables malheurs: nous sommes, tôt ou
tard, punis de n'avoir pas obéi aux lois sociales. Je t'écrirai de
Florence à ce sujet: un père, surtout quand il est magistrat, ne doit
pas rougir devant son fils. Adieu.
  Paris, février-mars 1830.
LA PAIX DU MÉNAGE.
  DÉDIÉ A MA CHÈRE NIÈCE, VALENTINE SURVILLE.
L'aventure retracée par cette Scène se passa vers la fin du mois de
novembre 1809, moment où le fugitif empire de Napoléon atteignit à
l'apogée de sa splendeur. Les fanfares de la victoire de Wagram
retentissaient encore au coeur de la monarchie autrichienne. La paix se
signait entre la France et la Coalition. Les rois et les princes vinrent
alors, comme des astres, accomplir leurs évolutions autour de Napoléon
qui se donna le plaisir d'entraîner l'Europe à sa suite, magnifique
essai de la puissance qu'il déploya plus tard à Dresde.
Jamais, au dire des contemporains, Paris ne vit de plus belles fêtes que
celles qui précédèrent et suivirent le mariage de ce souverain avec une
archiduchesse d'Autriche; jamais aux plus grands jours de l'ancienne
monarchie autant de têtes couronnées ne se pressèrent sur les rives de
la Seine, et jamais l'aristocratie française ne fut aussi riche ni aussi
brillante qu'alors. Les diamants répandus à profusion sur les parures,
les broderies d'or et d'argent des uniformes contrastaient si bien avec
l'indigence républicaine, qu'il semblait voir les richesses du globe
roulant dans les salons de Paris. Une ivresse générale avait comme saisi
cet empire d'un jour. Tous les militaires, sans en excepter leur chef,
jouissaient en parvenus des trésors conquis par un million d'hommes à
épaulettes de laine dont les exigences étaient satisfaites avec quelques
aunes de ruban rouge. A cette époque, la plupart des femmes
affichaient cette aisance de moeurs et ce relâchement de morale qui
signalèrent le règne de Louis XV. Soit pour imiter le ton de la
monarchie écroulée, soit que certains membres de la famille impériale
eussent donné l'exemple, ainsi que le prétendaient les frondeurs du
faubourg Saint-Germain, il est certain que, hommes et femmes, tous se
précipitaient dans le plaisir avec une intrépidité qui semblait présager
la fin du monde. Mais il existait alors une autre raison de cette
licence. L'engouement des femmes pour les militaires devint comme une
frénésie et concorda trop bien aux vues de l'empereur, pour qu'il y mît
un frein. Les fréquentes prises d'armes qui firent ressembler tous les
traités conclus entre l'Europe et Napoléon à des armistices, exposaient
les passions à des dénoûments aussi rapides que les décisions du chef
suprême de ces kolbacs, de ces dolmans et de ces aiguillettes qui
plurent tant au beau sexe. Les coeurs furent donc alors nomades comme
les régiments. D'un premier à un cinquième bulletin de la Grande-Armée,
une femme pouvait être successivement amante, épouse, mère et veuve.
Était-ce la perspective d'un prochain veuvage, celle d'une dotation, ou
l'espoir de porter un nom promis à l'Histoire, qui rendirent les
militaires si séduisants? Les femmes furent-elles entraînées vers eux
par la certitude que le secret de leurs passions serait enterré sur les
champs de bataille, ou doit-on chercher la cause de ce doux fanatisme
dans le noble attrait que le courage a pour elles? peut-être ces
raisons, que l'historien futur des moeurs impériales s'amusera sans
doute à peser, entraient-elles toutes pour quelque chose dans leur
facile promptitude à se livrer aux amours. Quoi qu'il en puisse être,
avouons-le-nous ici: les lauriers couvrirent alors bien des fautes, les
femmes recherchèrent avec ardeur ces hardis aventuriers qui leur
paraissaient de véritables sources d'honneurs, de richesses ou de
plaisirs, et aux yeux des jeunes filles une épaulette, cet hiéroglyphe
futur, signifia bonheur et liberté. Un trait de cette époque unique dans
nos annales et qui la caractérise, fut une passion effrénée pour tout ce
qui brillait: jamais on ne donna tant de feux d'artifice, jamais le
diamant n'atteignit à une si grande valeur. Les hommes aussi avides que
les femmes de ces cailloux blancs s'en paraient comme elles. Peut-être
l'obligation de mettre le butin sous la forme la plus facile à
transporter mit-elle les joyaux en honneur dans l'armée. Un homme
n'était pas aussi ridicule qu'il le serait aujourd'hui, quand le jabot
de sa chemise ou ses doigts offraient aux regards de gros diamants.
Murat, homme tout oriental, donna l'exemple d'un luxe absurde chez les
militaires modernes.
[Illustration:
LE COLONEL DE SOULANGES.
L'affaissement de ses membres et l'immobilité de son front accusaient
toute sa douleur.
(LA PAIX DU MÉNAGE.)]
Le comte de Gondreville, l'un des Lucullus de ce Sénat Conservateur qui
ne conserva rien, n'avait retardé sa fête en l'honneur de la paix que
pour mieux faire sa cour à Napoléon en s'efforçant d'éclipser les
flatteurs par lesquels il avait été prévenu. Les ambassadeurs de toutes
les puissances amies de la France sous bénéfice d'inventaire, les
personnages les plus importants de l'Empire, quelques princes même,
étaient en ce moment réunis dans les salons de l'opulent sénateur. La
danse languissait, chacun attendait l'empereur dont la présence était
promise par le comte. Napoléon aurait tenu parole sans la scène qui
éclata le soir même entre Joséphine et lui, scène qui révéla le prochain
divorce de ces augustes époux. La nouvelle de cette aventure, alors
tenue fort secrète, mais que l'histoire recueillait, ne parvint pas aux
oreilles des courtisans, et n'influa pas autrement que par l'absence de
Napoléon sur la gaieté de la fête du comte de Gondreville. Les plus
jolies femmes de Paris, empressées de se rendre chez lui sur la foi du
ouï-dire, y faisaient en ce moment assaut de luxe, de coquetterie, de
parure et de beauté. Orgueilleuse de ses richesses, la banque y défiait
ces éclatants généraux et ces grands-officiers de l'empire nouvellement
gorgés de croix, de titres et de décorations. Ces grands bals étaient
toujours des occasions saisies par de riches familles pour y produire
leurs héritières aux yeux des prétoriens de Napoléon, dans le fol espoir
d'échanger leurs magnifiques dots contre une faveur incertaine. Les
femmes qui se croyaient assez fortes de leur seule beauté venaient en
essayer le pouvoir. Là, comme ailleurs, le plaisir n'était qu'un masque.
Les visages sereins et riants, les fronts calmes y couvraient d'odieux
calculs; les témoignages d'amitié mentaient, et plus d'un personnage se
défiait moins de ses ennemis que de ses amis. Ces observations étaient
nécessaires pour expliquer les événements du petit imbroglio, sujet de
cette Scène, et la peinture, quelque adoucie qu'elle soit, du ton qui
régnait alors dans les salons de Paris.
--Tournez un peu les yeux vers cette colonne brisée qui supporte un
candélabre, apercevez-vous une jeune femme coiffée à la chinoise? là,
dans le coin, à gauche, elle a des clochettes bleues dans le bouquet de
cheveux châtains qui retombe en gerbes sur sa tête. Ne voyez-vous pas?
elle est si pâle qu'on la croirait souffrante, elle est mignonne et
toute petite; maintenant, elle tourne la tête vers nous; ses yeux bleus,
fendus en amande et doux à ravir, semblent faits exprès pour pleurer.
Mais, tenez donc! elle se baisse pour regarder madame de Vaudremont à
travers ce dédale de têtes toujours en mouvement dont les hautes
coiffures lui interceptent la vue.
--Ah! j'y suis, mon cher. Tu n'avais qu'à me la désigner comme la plus
blanche de toutes les femmes qui sont ici, je l'aurais reconnue, je l'ai
déjà bien remarquée; elle a le plus beau teint que j'aie jamais admiré.
D'ici, je te défie de distinguer sur son cou les perles qui séparent
chacun des saphirs de son collier. Mais elle doit avoir ou des moeurs ou
de la coquetterie, car à peine les ruches de son corsage
permettent-elles de soupçonner la beauté des contours. Quelles épaules!
quelle blancheur de lis!
--Qui est-ce? demanda celui qui avait parlé le premier.
--Ah! je ne sais pas.
--Aristocrate! Vous voulez donc, Montcornet, les garder toutes pour
vous.
--Cela te sied bien de me goguenarder! reprit Montcornet en souriant. Te
crois-tu le droit d'insulter un pauvre général comme moi, parce que,
rival heureux de Soulanges, tu ne fais pas une seule pirouette qui
n'alarme madame de Vaudremont? Ou bien est-ce parce que je ne suis
arrivé que depuis un mois dans la terre promise? Êtes-vous insolents,
vous autres administrateurs qui restez collés sur vos chaises pendant
que nous sommes au milieu des obus! Allons, monsieur le maître des
requêtes, laissez-nous glaner dans le champ dont la possession précaire
ne vous reste qu'au moment où nous le quittons. Hé! diantre, il faut que
tout le monde vive! Mon ami, si tu connaissais les Allemandes, tu me
servirais, je crois, auprès de la Parisienne qui t'est chère.
--Général, puisque vous avez honoré de votre attention cette femme que
j'aperçois ici pour la première fois, ayez donc la charité de me dire si
vous l'avez vue dansant.
--Eh! mon cher Martial, d'où viens-tu? Si l'on t'envoie en ambassade,
j'augure mal de tes succès. Ne vois-tu pas trois rangées des plus
intrépides coquettes de Paris entre elle et l'essaim de danseurs qui
bourdonne sous le lustre, et ne t'a-t-il pas fallu l'aide de ton
lorgnon pour la découvrir à l'angle de cette colonne où elle semble
enterrée dans l'obscurité malgré les bougies qui brillent au-dessus de
sa tête? Entre elle et nous, tant de diamants et tant de regards
scintillent, tant de plumes flottent, tant de dentelles, de fleurs et de
tresses ondoient, que ce serait un vrai miracle si quelque danseur
pouvait l'apercevoir au milieu de ces astres. Comment, Martial, tu n'as
pas deviné la femme de quelque sous-préfet de la Lippe ou de la Dyle qui
vient essayer de faire un préfet de son mari?
--Oh! il le sera, dit vivement le maître des requêtes.
--J'en doute, reprit le colonel de cuirassiers en riant, elle paraît
aussi neuve en intrigue que tu l'es en diplomatie. Je gage, Martial, que
tu ne sais pas comment elle se trouve là.
Le maître des requêtes regarda le colonel des cuirassiers de la garde
d'un air qui décelait autant de dédain que de curiosité.
--Eh bien! dit Montcornet en continuant, elle sera sans doute arrivée à
neuf heures précises, la première, peut-être, et probablement aura fort
embarrassé la comtesse de Gondreville, qui ne sait pas coudre deux
idées. Rebutée par la dame du logis, repoussée de chaise en chaise par
chaque nouvelle arrivée jusque dans les ténèbres de ce petit coin, elle
s'y sera laissé enfermer, victime de la jalousie de ces dames, qui
n'auront pas demandé mieux que d'ensevelir ainsi cette dangereuse
figure. Elle n'aura pas eu d'ami pour l'encourager à défendre la place
qu'elle a dû occuper d'abord sur le premier plan, chacune de ces
perfides danseuses aura intimé l'ordre aux hommes de sa coterie de ne
pas engager notre pauvre amie, sous peine des plus terribles punitions.
Voilà, mon cher, comment ces minois si tendres, si candides
en apparence, auront formé leur coalition contre l'inconnue; et
cela, sans qu'aucune de ces femmes-là se soit dit autre chose
que:--Connaissez-vous, ma chère, cette petite dame bleue? Tiens,
Martial, si tu veux être accablé en un quart d'heure de plus des regards
flatteurs et d'interrogations provocantes que tu n'en recevras peut-être
dans toute ta vie, essaie de vouloir percer le triple rempart qui défend
la reine de la Dyle, de la Lippe ou de la Charente. Tu verras si la plus
stupide de ces femmes ne saura pas inventer aussitôt une ruse capable
d'arrêter l'homme le plus déterminé à mettre en lumière notre plaintive
inconnue. Ne trouves-tu pas qu'elle a un peu l'air d'une élégie?
--Vous croyez, Montcornet? Ce serait donc une femme mariée?
--Pourquoi ne serait-elle pas veuve?
--Elle serait plus active, dit en riant le maître des requêtes.
--Peut-être est-ce une veuve dont le mari joue à la bouillotte, répliqua
le beau cuirassier.
--En effet, depuis la paix, il se fait tant de ces sortes de veuves?
répondit Martial. Mais, mon cher Montcornet, nous sommes deux niais.
Cette tête exprime encore trop d'ingénuité, il respire encore trop de
jeunesse et de verdeur sur le front et autour des tempes, pour que ce
soit une femme. Quels vigoureux tons de carnation! rien n'est flétri
dans les méplats du nez. Les lèvres, le menton, tout dans cette figure
est frais comme un bouton de rose blanche, quoique la physionomie en
soit comme voilée par les nuages de la tristesse. Qui peut faire pleurer
cette jeune personne?
--Les femmes pleurent pour si peu de chose, dit le colonel.
--Je ne sais, reprit Martial, mais elle ne pleure pas d'être là sans
danser, son chagrin ne date pas d'aujourd'hui; l'on voit qu'elle s'est
faite belle pour ce soir par préméditation. Elle aime déjà, je le
parierais.
--Bah? peut-être est-ce la fille de quelque princillon d'Allemagne,
personne ne lui parle, dit Montcornet.
--Ah! combien une pauvre fille est malheureuse, reprit Martial. A-t-on
plus de grâce et de finesse que notre petite inconnue? Eh! bien, pas une
des mégères qui l'entourent et qui se disent sensibles ne lui adressera
la parole. Si elle parlait, nous verrions si ses dents sont belles.
--Ah çà! tu t'emportes donc comme le lait à la moindre élévation de
température? s'écria le colonel un peu piqué de rencontrer si
promptement un rival dans son ami.
--Comment! dit le maître des requêtes sans s'apercevoir de
l'interrogation du général et en dirigeant son lorgnon sur tous les
personnages qui les entouraient, comment! personne ici ne pourra nous
nommer cette fleur exotique?
--Eh! c'est quelque demoiselle de compagnie, lui dit Montcornet.
--Bon! une demoiselle de compagnie parée de saphirs dignes d'une reine
et une robe de Malines? A d'autres, général! Vous ne serez pas non plus
très-fort en diplomatie si dans vos évaluations vous passez en un
moment de la princesse allemande à la demoiselle de compagnie.
Le général Montcornet arrêta par le bras un petit homme gras dont les
cheveux grisonnants et les yeux spirituels se voyaient à toutes les
encoignures de portes, et qui se mêlait sans cérémonie aux différents
groupes où il était respectueusement accueilli.
--Gondreville, mon cher ami, lui dit Montcornet, quelle est donc cette
charmante petite femme assise là-bas sous cet immense candélabre?
--Le candélabre? Ravrio, mon cher, Isabey en a donné le dessin.
--Oh! j'ai déjà reconnu ton goût et ton faste dans le meuble; mais la
femme?
--Ah! je ne la connais pas. C'est sans doute une amie de ma femme.
--Ou ta maîtresse, vieux sournois.
--Non, parole d'honneur! La comtesse de Gondreville est la seule femme
capable d'inviter des gens que personne ne connaît.
Malgré cette observation pleine d'aigreur, le gros petit homme conserva
sur ses lèvres le sourire de satisfaction intérieure que la supposition
du colonel des cuirassiers y avait fait naître. Celui-ci rejoignit, dans
un groupe voisin, le maître des requêtes occupé alors à y chercher, mais
en vain, des renseignements sur l'inconnue. Il le saisit par le bras et
lui dit à l'oreille:--Mon cher Martial, prends garde à toi! Madame de
Vaudremont te regarde depuis quelques minutes avec une attention
désespérante, elle est femme à deviner au mouvement seul de tes lèvres
ce que tu me dirais, nos yeux n'ont été déjà que trop significatifs,
elle en a très-bien aperçu et suivi la direction, et je la crois en ce
moment plus occupée que nous-mêmes de la petite dame bleue.
--Vieille ruse de guerre, mon cher Montcornet! que m'importe d'ailleurs?
Je suis comme l'empereur, quand je fais des conquêtes, je les garde.
--Martial, ta fatuité cherche des leçons. Comment! péquin, tu as le
bonheur d'être le mari désigné de madame de Vaudremont, d'une veuve de
vingt-deux ans, affligée de quatre mille napoléons de rente, d'une femme
qui te passe au doigt des diamants aussi beaux que celui-ci, ajouta-t-il
en prenant la main gauche du maître des requêtes qui la lui abandonna
complaisamment, et tu as encore la prétention de faire le Lovelace,
comme si tu étais colonel, et obligé de soutenir la réputation
militaire dans les garnisons! fi! Mais réfléchis donc à tout ce que tu
peux perdre.
--Je ne perdrai pas, du moins, ma liberté, répliqua Martial en riant
forcément.
Il jeta un regard passionné à madame de Vaudremont qui n'y répondit que
par un sourire plein d'inquiétude, car elle avait vu le colonel
examinant la bague du maître des requêtes.
--Écoute, Martial, reprit le colonel, si tu voltiges autour de ma jeune
inconnue, j'entreprendrai la conquête de madame de Vaudremont.
--Permis à vous, cher cuirassier, mais vous n'obtiendrez pas cela, dit
le jeune maître des requêtes en mettant l'ongle poli de son pouce sous
une de ses dents supérieures de laquelle il tira un petit bruit
goguenard.
--Songe que je suis garçon, reprit le colonel, que mon épée est toute ma
fortune, et que me défier ainsi, c'est asseoir Tantale devant un festin
qu'il dévorera.
--Prrr!
Cette railleuse accumulation de consonnes servit de réponse à la
provocation du général, que son ami toisa plaisamment avant de le
quitter. La mode de ce temps obligeait un homme à porter au bal une
culotte de casimir blanc et des bas de soie. Ce joli costume mettait en
relief la perfection des formes de Montcornet, alors âgé de trente-cinq
ans et qui attirait le regard par cette haute taille exigée pour les
cuirassiers de la garde impériale dont le bel uniforme rehaussait encore
sa prestance, encore jeune malgré l'embonpoint qu'il devait à
l'équitation. Ses moustaches noires ajoutaient à l'expression franche
d'un visage vraiment militaire dont le front était large et découvert,
le nez aquilin et la bouche vermeille. Les manières de Montcornet,
empreintes d'une certaine noblesse due à l'habitude du commandement,
pouvaient plaire à une femme qui aurait eu le bon esprit de ne pas
vouloir faire un esclave de son mari. Le colonel sourit en regardant le
maître des requêtes, l'un de ses meilleurs amis de collége, et dont la
petite taille svelte l'obligea, pour répondre à sa moquerie, de porter
un peu bas son coup d'oeil amical.
Le baron Martial de la Roche-Hugon était un jeune Provençal que Napoléon
protégeait et qui semblait promis à quelque fastueuse ambassade, il
avait séduit l'empereur par une complaisance italienne, par le génie de
l'intrigue, par cette éloquence de salon et cette science des manières
qui remplacent si facilement les éminentes qualités d'un homme solide.
Quoique vive et jeune, sa figure possédait déjà l'éclat immobile du
fer-blanc, l'une des qualités indispensables aux diplomates et qui leur
permet de cacher leurs émotions, de déguiser leurs sentiments, si
toutefois cette impassibilité n'annonce pas en eux l'absence de toute
émotion et la mort des sentiments. On peut regarder le coeur des
diplomates comme un problème insoluble, car les trois plus illustres
ambassadeurs de l'époque se sont signalés par la persistance de la
haine, et par des attachements romanesques. Néanmoins, Martial
appartenait à cette classe d'hommes capables de calculer leur avenir au
milieu de leurs plus ardentes jouissances, il avait déjà jugé le monde
et cachait son ambition sous la fatuité de l'homme à bonnes fortunes, en
déguisant son talent sous les livrées de la médiocrité, après avoir
remarqué la rapidité avec laquelle s'avançaient les gens qui donnaient
peu d'ombrage au maître.
Les deux amis furent obligés de se quitter en se donnant une cordiale
poignée de main. La ritournelle qui prévenait les dames de former les
quadrilles d'une nouvelle contredanse chassa les hommes du vaste espace
où ils causaient au milieu du salon. Cette conversation rapide, tenue
dans l'intervalle qui sépare toujours les contredanses, eut lieu devant
la cheminée du grand salon de l'hôtel Gondreville. Les demandes et les
réponses de ce bavardage assez commun au bal avaient été comme soufflées
par chacun des deux interlocuteurs à l'oreille de son voisin. Néanmoins
les girandoles et les flambeaux de la cheminée répandaient une si
abondante lumière sur les deux amis que leurs figures trop fortement
éclairées ne purent déguiser, malgré leur discrétion diplomatique,
l'imperceptible expression de leurs sentiments, ni à la fine comtesse,
ni à la candide inconnue. Cet espionnage de la pensée est peut-être chez
les oisifs un des plaisirs qu'ils trouvent dans le monde, tandis que
tant de niais dupés s'y ennuient sans oser en convenir.
Pour comprendre tout l'intérêt de cette conversation, il est nécessaire
de raconter un événement qui par d'invisibles liens allait réunir les
personnages de ce petit drame, alors épars dans les salons. A onze
heures du soir environ, au moment où les danseuses reprenaient leurs
places, la société de l'hôtel Gondreville avait vu apparaître la plus
belle femme de Paris, la reine de la mode, la seule qui manquât à cette
splendide assemblée. Elle se faisait une loi de ne jamais arriver qu'à
l'instant où les salons offraient ce mouvement animé qui ne permet pas
aux femmes de garder long-temps la fraîcheur de leurs figures ni celle
de leurs toilettes. Ce moment rapide est comme le printemps d'un bal.
Une heure après, quand le plaisir a passé, quand la fatigue arrive, tout
y est flétri. Madame de Vaudremont ne commettait jamais la faute de
rester à une fête pour s'y montrer avec des fleurs penchées, des boucles
défrisées, des garnitures froissées, avec une figure semblable à toutes
celles qui, sollicitées par le sommeil, ne le trompent pas toujours.
Elle se gardait bien de laisser voir, comme ses rivales, sa beauté
endormie; elle savait soutenir habilement sa réputation de coquetterie
en se retirant toujours d'un bal aussi brillante qu'elle y était entrée.
Les femmes se disaient à l'oreille, avec un sentiment d'envie, qu'elle
préparait et mettait autant de parures qu'elle avait de bals dans une
soirée. Cette fois, madame de Vaudremont ne devait pas être maîtresse de
quitter à son gré le salon où elle arrivait alors en triomphe. Un moment
arrêtée sur le seuil de la porte, elle jeta des regards observateurs,
quoique rapides, sur les femmes dont les toilettes furent aussitôt
étudiées afin de se convaincre que la sienne les éclipserait toutes. La
célèbre coquette s'offrit à l'admiration de l'assemblée, conduite par un
des plus braves colonels de l'artillerie de la Garde, un favori de
l'empereur, le comte de Soulanges. L'union momentanée et fortuite de ces
deux personnages eut sans doute quelque chose de mystérieux. En
entendant annoncer monsieur de Soulanges et la comtesse de Vaudremont,
quelques femmes placées en tapisserie se levèrent, et des hommes
accourus des salons voisins se pressèrent aux portes du salon principal.
Un de ces plaisants, qui ne manquent jamais à ces réunions nombreuses,
dit en voyant entrer la comtesse et son chevalier: «Que les dames
avaient tout autant de curiosité à contempler un homme fidèle à sa
passion, que les hommes à examiner une jolie femme difficile à fixer.»
Quoique le comte de Soulanges, jeune homme d'environ trente-deux ans,
fût doué de ce tempérament nerveux qui engendre chez l'homme les grandes
qualités, ses formes grêles et son teint pâle prévenaient peu en sa
faveur; ses yeux noirs annonçaient beaucoup de vivacité, mais dans le
monde il était taciturne, et rien en lui ne révélait l'un des talents
oratoires qui devaient briller à la Droite dans les assemblées
législatives de la Restauration. La comtesse de Vaudremont, grande femme
légèrement grasse, d'une peau éblouissante de blancheur, qui portait
bien sa petite tête et possédait l'immense avantage d'inspirer l'amour
par la gentillesse de ses manières, était de ces créatures qui tiennent
toutes les promesses que fait leur beauté. Ce couple, devenu pour
quelques instants l'objet de l'attention générale, ne laissa pas
long-temps la curiosité s'exercer sur son compte. Le colonel et la
comtesse semblèrent parfaitement comprendre que le hasard venait de les
placer dans une situation gênante. En les voyant s'avancer, Martial
s'élança dans le groupe d'hommes qui occupait le poste de la cheminée,
pour observer, à travers les têtes qui lui formaient comme un rempart,
madame de Vaudremont avec l'attention jalouse que donne le premier feu
de la passion: une voix secrète semblait lui dire que le succès dont il
s'enorgueillissait serait peut-être précaire; mais le sourire de
politesse froide par lequel la comtesse remercia monsieur de Soulanges,
et le geste qu'elle fit pour le congédier en s'asseyant auprès de madame
de Gondreville, détendirent tous les muscles que la jalousie avait
contractés sur sa figure. Cependant apercevant debout à deux pas du
canapé sur lequel était madame de Vaudremont, Soulanges, qui parut ne
plus comprendre le regard par lequel la jeune coquette lui avait dit
qu'ils jouaient l'un et l'autre un rôle ridicule, le Provençal à la tête
volcanique fronça de nouveau les noirs sourcils qui ombrageaient ses
yeux bleus, caressa par maintien les boucles de ses cheveux bruns, et,
sans trahir l'émotion qui lui faisait palpiter le coeur, il surveilla la
contenance de la comtesse et celle de monsieur de Soulanges, tout en
badinant avec ses voisins, il saisit alors la main du colonel qui venait
renouveler connaissance avec lui, mais il l'écouta sans l'entendre, tant
il était préoccupé. Soulanges jetait des regards tranquilles sur la
quadruple rangée de femmes qui encadrait l'immense salon du sénateur, en
admirant cette bordure de diamants, de rubis, de gerbes d'or et de têtes
parées dont l'éclat faisait presque pâlir le feu des bougies, le cristal
des lustres et les dorures. Le calme insouciant de son rival fit perdre
contenance au maître des requêtes. Incapable de maîtriser la secrète
impatience qui le transportait, Martial s'avança vers madame de
Vaudremont pour la saluer. Quand le Provençal apparut, Soulanges lui
lança un regard terne et détourna la tête avec impertinence. Un silence
grave régna dans le salon où la curiosité fut à son comble. Toutes les
têtes tendues offrirent les expressions les plus bizarres, chacun
craignit et attendit un de ces éclats que les gens bien élevés se
gardent toujours de faire. Tout à coup la pâle figure du comte devint
aussi rouge que l'écarlate de ses parements, et ses regards se
baissèrent aussitôt vers le parquet, pour ne pas laisser deviner le
sujet de son trouble. En voyant l'inconnue humblement placée au pied du
candélabre, il passa d'un air triste devant le maître des requêtes, et
se réfugia dans un des salons de jeu. Martial et l'assemblée crurent que
Soulanges lui cédait publiquement la place, par la crainte du ridicule
qui s'attache toujours aux amants détrônés. Le maître des requêtes
releva fièrement la tête, regarda l'inconnue; puis quand il s'assit avec
aisance auprès de madame de Vaudremont, il l'écouta d'un air si distrait
qu'il n'entendit pas ces paroles prononcées sous l'éventail par la
coquette:--Martial, vous me ferez plaisir de ne pas porter ce soir la
bague que vous m'avez arrachée. J'ai mes raisons, et vous les
expliquerai, dans un moment, quand nous nous retirerons. Vous me donnez
le bras pour aller chez la princesse de Wagram.
--Pourquoi donc avez-vous pris la main du colonel? demanda le baron.
--Je l'ai rencontré sous le péristyle, répondit-elle; mais, laissez-moi,
chacun nous observe.
Martial rejoignit le colonel de cuirassiers. La petite dame bleue devint
alors le lien commun de l'inquiétude qui agitait à la fois et si
diversement le cuirassier, Soulanges, Martial et la comtesse de
Vaudremont. Quand les deux amis se séparèrent après s'être porté le défi
qui termina leur conversation, le maître des requêtes s'élança vers
madame de Vaudremont, et sut la placer au milieu du plus brillant
quadrille. A la faveur de cette espèce d'enivrement dans lequel une
femme est toujours plongée par la danse et par le mouvement d'un bal où
les hommes se montrent avec le charlatanisme de la toilette qui ne leur
donne pas moins d'attraits qu'elle en prête aux femmes, Martial crut
pouvoir s'abandonner impunément au charme qui l'attirait vers
l'inconnue. S'il réussit à dérober les premiers regards qu'il jeta sur
la dame bleue à l'inquiète activité des yeux de la comtesse, il fut
bientôt surpris en flagrant délit; et s'il fit excuser une première
préoccupation, il ne justifia pas l'impertinent silence par lequel il
répondit plus tard à la plus séduisante des interrogations qu'une femme
puisse adresser à un homme: m'aimez-vous ce soir? Plus il était rêveur,
plus la comtesse se montrait pressante et taquine. Pendant que Martial
dansait, le colonel alla de groupe en groupe y quêtant des
renseignements sur la jeune inconnue. Après avoir épuisé la complaisance
de toutes les personnes, et même celle des indifférents, il se
déterminait à profiter d'un moment où la comtesse de Gondreville
paraissait libre pour lui demander à elle-même le nom de cette dame
mystérieuse, quand il aperçut un léger vide entre la colonne brisée qui
supportait le candélabre et les deux divans qui venaient y aboutir. Le
colonel profita du moment où la danse laissait vacante une grande partie
des chaises qui formaient plusieurs rangs de fortifications défendues
par des mères ou par des femmes d'un certain âge, et entreprit de
traverser cette palissade couverte de châles et de mouchoirs. Il se mit
à complimenter les douairières; puis, de femme en femme, de politesse en
politesse, il finit par atteindre auprès de l'inconnue la place vide. Au
risque d'accrocher les griffons et les chimères de l'immense flambeau,
il se maintint là sous le feu et la cire des bougies, au grand
mécontentement de Martial. Trop adroit pour interpeller brusquement la
petite dame bleue qu'il avait à sa droite, le colonel commença par dire
à une grande dame assez laide qui se trouvait assise à sa
gauche:--Voilà, madame, un bien beau bal! Quel luxe! quel mouvement!
D'honneur, les femmes y sont toutes jolies! Si vous ne dansez pas, c'est
sans doute mauvaise volonté.
Cette insipide conversation engagée par le colonel avait pour but de
faire parler sa voisine de droite, qui, silencieuse et préoccupée, ne
lui accordait pas la plus légère attention. L'officier tenait en réserve
une foule de phrases qui devaient se terminer par un: Et vous, madame?
sur lequel il comptait beaucoup. Mais il fut étrangement surpris en
apercevant quelques larmes dans les yeux de l'inconnue, que madame de
Vaudremont paraissait captiver entièrement.
--Madame est sans doute mariée, demanda enfin le colonel Montcornet
d'une voix mal assurée.
--Oui, monsieur, répondit l'inconnue.
--Monsieur votre mari est sans doute ici?
--Oui, monsieur.
--Et pourquoi donc, madame, restez-vous à cette place? est-ce par
coquetterie?
L'affligée sourit tristement.
--Accordez-moi l'honneur, madame, d'être votre cavalier pour la
contredanse suivante, et je ne vous ramènerai certes pas ici! Je vois
près de la cheminée une gondole vide, venez-y. Quand tant de gens
s'apprêtent à trôner, et que la folie du jour est la royauté, je ne
conçois pas que vous refusiez d'accepter le titre de reine du bal qui
semble promis à votre beauté.
--Monsieur, je ne danserai pas.
L'intonation brève des réponses de cette femme était si désespérante,
que le colonel se vit forcé d'abandonner la place. Martial, qui devina
la dernière demande du colonel et le refus qu'il essuyait, se mit à
sourire et se caressa le menton en faisant briller la bague qu'il avait
au doigt.
--De quoi riez-vous? lui dit la comtesse de Vaudremont.
--De l'insuccès de ce pauvre colonel, qui vient de faire un pas de
clerc...
--Je vous avais prié d'ôter votre bague, reprit la comtesse en
l'interrompant.
--Je ne l'ai pas entendu.
--Si vous n'entendez rien ce soir, vous savez voir tout, monsieur le
baron, répondit madame de Vaudremont d'un air piqué.
--Voilà un jeune homme qui montre un bien beau brillant, dit alors
l'inconnue au colonel.
--Magnifique, répondit-il. Ce jeune homme est le baron Martial de la
Roche-Hugon, un de mes plus intimes amis.
--Je vous remercie de m'avoir dit son nom, reprit-elle, il paraît fort
aimable.
--Oui, mais il est un peu léger.
--On pourrait croire qu'il est bien avec la comtesse de Vaudremont,
demanda la jeune dame en interrogeant des yeux le colonel.
--Du dernier mieux!
L'inconnue pâlit.
--Allons, pensa le militaire, elle aime ce diable de Martial.
Je croyais madame de Vaudremont engagée depuis longtemps avec monsieur
de Soulanges, reprit la jeune femme un peu remise de la souffrance
intérieure qui venait d'altérer l'éclat de son visage.
--Depuis huit jours, la comtesse le trompe, répondit le colonel. Mais
vous devez avoir vu ce pauvre Soulanges à son entrée; il essaie encore
de ne pas croire à son malheur.
--Je l'ai vu, dit la dame bleue. Puis elle ajouta un:--Monsieur, je vous
remercie, dont l'intonation équivalait à un congé.
En ce moment, la contredanse étant près de finir, le colonel,
désappointé, n'eut que le temps de se retirer en se disant par manière
de consolation:--Elle est mariée.
--Eh bien! courageux cuirassier, s'écria le baron en entraînant le
colonel dans l'embrasure d'une croisée pour y respirer l'air pur des
jardins, où en êtes-vous?
--Elle est mariée, mon cher.
--Qu'est-ce que cela fait?
--Ah diantre! j'ai des moeurs, répondit le colonel, je ne veux plus
m'adresser qu'à des femmes que je puisse épouser. D'ailleurs, Martial,
elle m'a formellement manifesté la volonté de ne pas danser.
--Colonel, parions votre cheval gris pommelé contre cent napoléons
qu'elle dansera ce soir avec moi.
--Je veux bien! dit le colonel en frappant dans la main du fat. En
attendant, je vais voir Soulanges, il connaît peut-être cette dame qui
m'a semblé s'intéresser à lui.
--Mon brave, vous avez perdu, dit Martial en riant. Mes yeux se sont
rencontrés avec les siens, et je m'y connais. Cher colonel, vous ne m'en
voudrez pas de danser avec elle après le refus que vous avez essuyé?
--Non, non, rira bien qui rira le dernier. Au reste, Martial, je suis
beau joueur et bon ennemi, je te préviens qu'elle aime les diamants.
A ce propos, les deux amis se séparèrent. Le général Montcornet se
dirigea vers le salon de jeu, où il aperçut le comte de Soulanges assis
à une table de bouillotte. Quoiqu'il n'existât entre les deux colonels
que cette amitié banale établie par les périls de la guerre et les
devoirs du service, le colonel des cuirassiers fut douloureusement
affecté de voir le colonel d'artillerie, qu'il connaissait pour un homme
sage, engagé dans une partie où il pouvait se ruiner. Les monceaux d'or
et de billets étalés sur le fatal tapis attestaient la fureur du jeu. Un
cercle d'hommes silencieux entourait les joueurs attablés. Quelques mots
retentissaient bien parfois comme: _Passe_, _jeu_, _tiens_, _mille
louis_, _tenus_; mais il semblait, en regardant ces cinq personnages
immobiles, qu'ils ne se parlassent que des yeux. Quand le colonel,
effrayé de la pâleur de Soulanges, s'approcha de lui, le comte gagnait.
L'ambassadeur autrichien, un banquier célèbre se levaient complétement
décavés de sommes considérables. Soulanges devint encore plus sombre en
recueillant une masse d'or et de billets, il ne compta même pas; un amer
dédain crispa ses lèvres, il semblait menacer la fortune au lieu de la
remercier de ses faveurs.
--Courage, lui dit le colonel, courage, Soulanges! puis croyant lui
rendre un vrai service en l'arrachant au jeu: Venez, ajouta-t-il, j'ai
une bonne nouvelle à vous apprendre, mais à une condition.
--Laquelle? demanda Soulanges.
--Celle de me répondre à ce que je vous demanderai.
Le comte de Soulanges se leva brusquement, mit son gain d'un air fort
insouciant dans un mouchoir qu'il avait tourmenté d'une manière
convulsive, et son visage était si farouche, qu'aucun joueur ne s'avisa
de trouver mauvais qu'il fît _Charlemagne_. Les figures parurent même se
dilater quand cette tête maussade et chagrine ne fut plus dans le cercle
lumineux que décrit au-dessus d'une table un flambeau de bouillotte.
--Ces diables de militaires s'entendent comme des larrons en foire! dit
à voix basse un diplomate de la galerie en prenant la place du colonel.
Une seule figure blême et fatiguée se tourna vers le rentrant, et lui
dit en lui lançant un regard qui brilla, mais s'éteignit comme le feu
d'un diamant:--Qui dit militaire ne dit pas civil, monsieur le ministre.
--Mon cher, dit Montcornet à Soulanges en l'attirant dans un coin, ce
matin l'empereur a parlé de vous avec éloge, et votre promotion au
maréchalat n'est pas douteuse.
--Le patron n'aime pas l'artillerie.
--Oui, mais il adore la noblesse et vous êtes un ci-devant! Le patron,
reprit Montcornet, a dit que ceux qui s'étaient mariés à Paris pendant
la campagne ne devaient pas être considérés comme en disgrâce. Eh! bien?
Le comte de Soulanges semblait ne rien comprendre à ce discours.
--Ah çà! j'espère maintenant, reprit le colonel, que vous me direz si
vous connaissez une charmante petite femme assise au pied d'un
candélabre...
A ces mots, les yeux du comte s'animèrent, il saisit avec une violence
inouïe la main du colonel:--Mon cher général, lui dit-il d'une voix
sensiblement altérée, si un autre que vous me faisait cette question, je
lui fendrais le crâne avec cette masse d'or. Laissez-moi, je vous en
supplie. J'ai plus envie, ce soir, de me brûler la cervelle, que... Je
hais tout ce que je vois. Aussi, vais-je partir. Cette joie, cette
musique, ces visages stupides qui rient m'assassinent.
--Mon pauvre ami, reprit d'une voix douce Montcornet en frappant
amicalement dans la main de Soulanges, vous êtes passionné! Que
diriez-vous donc si je vous apprenais que Martial songe si peu à madame
de Vaudremont, qu'il s'est épris de cette petite dame!
--S'il lui parle, s'écria Soulanges en bégayant de fureur, je le rendrai
aussi plat que son portefeuille, quand même le fat serait dans le giron
de l'empereur.
Et le comte tomba comme anéanti sur la causeuse vers laquelle le colonel
l'avait mené. Ce dernier se retira lentement, il s'aperçut que Soulanges
était en proie à une colère trop violente pour que des plaisanteries ou
les soins d'une amitié superficielle pussent le calmer. Quand le colonel
Montcornet rentra dans le grand salon de danse, madame de Vaudremont fut
la première personne qui s'offrit à ses regards, et il remarqua sur sa
figure, ordinairement si calme, quelques traces d'une agitation mal
déguisée. Une chaise était vacante auprès d'elle, le colonel vint s'y
asseoir.
--Je gage que vous êtes tourmentée? dit-il.
--Bagatelle, général. Je voudrais être partie d'ici, j'ai promis d'être
au bal de la grande-duchesse de Berg, et il faut que j'aille auparavant
chez la princesse de Wagram. Monsieur de la Roche-Hugon, qui le sait,
s'amuse à conter fleurette à des douairières.
--Ce n'est pas là tout à fait le sujet de votre inquiétude, et je gage
cent louis que vous resterez ici ce soir.
--Impertinent!
--J'ai donc dit vrai?
--Eh bien! que pensé-je? reprit la comtesse en donnant un coup
d'éventail sur les doigts du colonel. Je suis capable de vous
récompenser si vous le devinez.
--Je n'accepterai pas le défi, j'ai trop d'avantages.
--Présomptueux!
--Vous craignez de voir Martial aux pieds...
--De qui? demanda la comtesse en affectant la surprise.
--De ce candélabre, répondit le colonel en montrant la belle inconnue,
et regardant la comtesse avec une attention gênante.
--Vous avez deviné, répondit la coquette en se cachant la figure sous
son éventail, avec lequel elle se mit à jouer. La vieille madame de
Grandlieu, qui, vous le savez, est maligne comme un vieux singe,
reprit-elle après un moment de silence, vient de me dire que monsieur de
la Roche-Hugon courait quelques dangers à courtiser cette inconnue qui
se trouve ce soir ici comme un trouble-fête. J'aimerais mieux voir la
mort que cette figure si cruellement belle et pâle autant qu'une vision.
C'est mon mauvais génie. Madame de Grandlieu, continua-t-elle après
avoir laissé échapper un signe de dépit, qui ne va au bal que pour tout
voir en faisant semblant de dormir, m'a cruellement inquiétée. Martial
me paiera cher le tour qu'il me joue. Cependant, engagez-le, général,
puisque c'est votre ami, à ne pas me faire de la peine.
--Je viens de voir un homme qui ne se propose rien moins que de lui
brûler la cervelle s'il s'adresse à cette petite dame. Cet homme-là,
madame, est de parole. Mais je connais Martial, ces périls sont autant
d'encouragements. Il y a plus; nous avons parié. Ici le colonel baissa
la voix.
--Serait-ce vrai? demanda la comtesse.
--Sur mon honneur.
--Merci, général, répondit madame de Vaudremont en lui lançant un regard
plein de coquetterie.
--Me ferez-vous l'honneur de danser avec moi?
--Oui, mais la seconde contredanse. Pendant celle-ci, je veux savoir ce
que peut devenir cette intrigue, et savoir qui est cette petite dame
bleue, elle a l'air spirituel.
Le colonel, voyant que madame de Vaudremont voulait être seule,
s'éloigna satisfait d'avoir si bien commencé son attaque.
Il se rencontre dans les fêtes quelques dames qui, semblables à madame
de Grandlieu, sont là comme de vieux marins occupés sur le bord de la
mer à contempler les jeunes matelots aux prises avec les tempêtes. En ce
moment, madame de Grandlieu, qui paraissait s'intéresser aux personnages
de cette scène, put facilement deviner la lutte à laquelle la comtesse
était en proie. La jeune coquette avait beau s'éventer gracieusement,
sourire à des jeunes gens qui la saluaient et mettre en usage les ruses
dont se sert une femme pour cacher son émotion, la douairière, l'une des
plus perspicaces et malicieuses duchesses que le dix-huitième siècle
avait léguées au dix-neuvième, savait lire dans son coeur et dans sa
pensée. La vieille dame semblait reconnaître les mouvements
imperceptibles qui décèlent les affections de l'âme. Le pli le plus
léger qui venait rider ce front si blanc et si pur, le tressaillement le
plus insensible des pommettes, le jeu des sourcils, l'inflexion la moins
visible des lèvres dont le corail mouvant ne pouvait lui rien cacher,
étaient pour la duchesse comme les caractères d'un livre. Du fond de sa
bergère, que sa robe remplissait entièrement, la coquette émérite, tout
en causant avec un diplomate qui la recherchait afin de recueillir les
anecdotes qu'elle contait si bien, s'admirait elle-même dans la jeune
coquette; elle la prit en goût en lui voyant si bien déguiser son
chagrin et les déchirements de son coeur. Madame de Vaudremont
ressentait en effet autant de douleur qu'elle feignait de gaieté: elle
avait cru rencontrer dans Martial un homme de talent sur l'appui duquel
elle comptait pour embellir sa vie de tous les enchantements du pouvoir;
en ce moment, elle reconnaissait une erreur aussi cruelle pour sa
réputation que pour son amour-propre. Chez elle, comme chez les autres
femmes de cette époque, la soudaineté des passions augmentait leur
vivacité. Les âmes qui vivent beaucoup et vite ne souffrent pas moins
que celles qui se consument dans une seule affection. La prédilection de
la comtesse pour Martial était née de la veille, il est vrai; mais le
plus inepte des chirurgiens sait que la souffrance causée par
l'amputation d'un membre vivant est plus douloureuse que ne l'est celle
d'un membre malade. Il y avait de l'avenir dans le goût de madame de
Vaudremont pour Martial, tandis que sa passion précédente était sans
espérance, et empoisonnée par les remords de Soulanges. La vieille
duchesse, qui épiait le moment opportun de parler à la comtesse,
s'empressa de congédier son ambassadeur; car, en présence de maîtresses
et d'amants brouillés, tout intérêt pâlit, même chez une vieille femme.
Pour engager la lutte, madame de Grandlieu lança sur madame de
Vaudremont un regard sardonique qui fit craindre à la jeune coquette de
voir son sort entre les mains de la douairière. Il est de ces regards de
femme à femme qui sont comme des flambeaux amenés dans les dénouements
de tragédie. Il faut avoir connu cette duchesse pour apprécier la
terreur que le jeu de sa physionomie inspirait à la comtesse. Madame de
Grandlieu était grande, ses traits faisaient dire d'elle:--Voilà une
femme qui a dû être jolie! Elle se couvrait les joues de tant de rouge
que ses rides ne paraissaient presque plus; mais loin de recevoir un
éclat factice de ce carmin foncé, ses yeux n'en étaient que plus ternes.
Elle portait une grande quantité de diamants, et s'habillait avec assez
de goût pour ne pas prêter au ridicule. Son nez pointu annonçait
l'épigramme. Un râtelier bien mis conservait à sa bouche une grimace
d'ironie qui rappelait celle de Voltaire. Cependant l'exquise politesse
de ses manières adoucissait si bien la tournure malicieuse de ses idées
qu'on ne pouvait l'accuser de méchanceté. Les yeux gris de la vieille
dame s'animèrent, un regard triomphal accompagné d'un sourire qui
disait:--Je vous l'avais bien promis! traversa le salon, et répandit
l'incarnat de l'espérance sur les joues pâles de la jeune femme qui
gémissait au pied du candélabre. Cette alliance entre madame de
Grandlieu et l'inconnue ne pouvait échapper à l'oeil exercé de la
comtesse de Vaudremont, qui entrevit un mystère et le voulut pénétrer.
En ce moment, le baron de la Roche-Hugon, après avoir achevé de
questionner toutes les douairières sans pouvoir apprendre le nom
de la dame bleue, s'adressait en désespoir de cause à la
comtesse de Gondreville, et n'en recevait que cette réponse peu
satisfaisante:--C'est une dame que l'_ancienne_ duchesse de Grandlieu
m'a présentée. En se retournant par hasard vers la bergère occupée par
la vieille dame, le maître des requêtes en surprit le regard
d'intelligence lancé sur l'inconnue, et quoiqu'il fût assez mal avec
elle depuis quelque temps, il résolut de l'aborder. En voyant le
sémillant baron rôdant autour de sa bergère, l'ancienne duchesse sourit
avec une malignité sardonique, et regarda madame de Vaudremont d'un air
qui fit rire le colonel Montcornet.
--Si la vieille bohémienne prend un air d'amitié, pensa le baron, elle
va sans doute me jouer quelque méchant tour.--Madame, lui dit-il, vous
vous êtes chargée, me dit-on, de veiller sur un bien précieux trésor!
--Me prenez-vous pour un dragon, demanda la vieille dame. Mais de qui
parlez-vous? ajouta-t-elle avec une douceur de voix qui rendit
l'espérance à Martial.
--De cette petite dame inconnue que la jalousie de toutes ces coquettes
a confinée là-bas. Vous connaissez sans doute sa famille?
--Oui, dit la duchesse; mais que voulez-vous faire d'une héritière de
province, mariée depuis quelque temps, une fille bien née que vous ne
connaissez pas, vous autres, elle ne va nulle part.
--Pourquoi ne danse-t-elle pas? Elle est si belle! Voulez-vous que nous
fassions un traité de paix? Si vous daignez m'instruire de tout ce que
j'ai intérêt à savoir, je vous jure que votre demande en restitution des
bois de Marigny par le domaine extraordinaire sera chaudement appuyée
auprès de l'empereur.
--Monsieur, répondit la vieille dame avec une gravité trompeuse,
amenez-moi la comtesse de Vaudremont. Je vous promets de lui révéler le
mystère qui rend notre inconnue si intéressante. Voyez, tous les hommes
du bal sont arrivés au même degré de curiosité que vous. Les yeux se
portent involontairement vers ce candélabre où ma protégée s'est
modestement placée, elle recueille tous les hommages qu'on a voulu lui
ravir. Bienheureux celui qu'elle prendra pour danseur! Là, elle
s'interrompit en fixant la comtesse de Vaudremont par un de ces regards
qui disent si bien:--Nous parlons de vous. Puis elle ajouta:--Je pense
que vous aimerez mieux apprendre le nom de l'inconnue de la bouche de
votre belle comtesse que de la mienne?
L'attitude de la duchesse était si provoquante que madame de Vaudremont
se leva, vint auprès d'elle, s'assit sur la chaise que lui offrit
Martial; et, sans faire attention à lui:--Je devine, madame, lui
dit-elle en riant, que vous parlez de moi; mais j'avoue mon infériorité,
je ne sais si c'est en bien ou en mal.
Madame de Grandlieu serra de sa vieille main sèche et ridée la jolie
main de la jeune femme, et, d'un ton de compassion, elle lui répondit à
voix basse:--Pauvre petite!
Les deux femmes se regardèrent. Madame de Vaudremont comprit que
Martial était de trop, et le congédia en lui disant d'un air
impérieux:--Laissez-nous!
Le maître des requêtes, peu satisfait de voir la comtesse sous le charme
de la dangereuse sibylle qui l'avait attirée près d'elle, lui lança un
de ces regards d'homme, puissants sur un coeur aveugle, mais qui
paraissent ridicules à une femme quand elle commence à juger celui de
qui elle s'est éprise.
--Auriez-vous la prétention de singer l'empereur? dit madame de
Vaudremont en mettant sa tête de trois quarts pour contempler le maître
des requêtes d'un air ironique.
Martial avait trop l'usage du monde, trop de finesse et de calcul pour
s'exposer à rompre avec une femme si bien en cour et que l'empereur
voulait marier; il compta d'ailleurs sur la jalousie qu'il se proposait
d'éveiller en elle comme sur le meilleur moyen de deviner le secret de
sa froideur, et s'éloigna d'autant plus volontiers qu'en cet instant une
nouvelle contredanse mettait tout le monde en mouvement. Le baron eut
l'air de céder la place aux quadrilles, il alla s'appuyer sur le marbre
d'une console, se croisa les bras sur la poitrine, et resta tout occupé
de l'entretien des deux dames. De temps en temps il suivait les regards
que toutes deux jetèrent à plusieurs reprises sur l'inconnue. Comparant
alors la comtesse à cette beauté nouvelle que le mystère rendait si
attrayante, le baron fut en proie aux odieux calculs habituels aux
hommes à bonnes fortunes: il flottait entre une fortune à prendre et son
caprice à contenter. Le reflet des lumières faisait si bien ressortir sa
figure soucieuse et sombre sur les draperies de moire blanche froissée
par ses cheveux noirs, qu'on aurait pu le comparer à quelque mauvais
génie. De loin, plus d'un observateur dut sans doute se dire:--Voilà
encore un pauvre diable qui paraît s'amuser beaucoup!
L'épaule droite légèrement appuyée sur la chambranle de la porte qui se
trouvait entre le salon de danse et la salle de jeu, le colonel pouvait
rire incognito sous ses amples moustaches, il jouissait du plaisir de
contempler le tumulte du bal; il voyait cent jolies têtes tournoyant au
gré des caprices de la danse; il lisait sur quelques figures, comme sur
celles de la comtesse et de son ami Martial, les secrets de leur
agitation; puis, en détournant la tête, il se demandait quel rapport
existait entre l'air sombre du comte de Soulanges toujours assis sur la
causeuse, et la physionomie plaintive de la dame inconnue sur le visage
de laquelle apparaissaient tour à tour les joies de l'espérance et les
angoisses d'une terreur involontaire. Montcornet était là comme le roi
de la fête, il trouvait dans ce tableau mouvant une vue complète du
monde, et il en riait en recueillant les sourires intéressés de cent
femmes brillantes et parées: un colonel de la garde impériale, poste qui
comportait le grade de général de brigade, était certes un des plus
beaux partis de l'armée. Il était minuit environ. Les conversations, le
jeu, la danse, la coquetterie, les intérêts, les malices et les projets,
tout arrivait à ce degré de chaleur qui arrache à un jeune homme cette
exclamation:--Le beau bal!
--Mon bon petit ange, disait madame de Grandlieu à la comtesse, vous
êtes à un âge où j'ai fait bien des fautes. En vous voyant souffrir
tout à l'heure mille morts, j'ai eu la pensée de vous donner quelques
avis charitables. Commettre des fautes à vingt-deux ans, n'est-ce pas
gâter son avenir, n'est-ce pas déchirer la robe qu'on doit mettre? Ma
chère, nous n'apprenons que bien tard à nous en servir sans la
chiffonner. Continuez, mon coeur, à vous procurer des ennemis adroits et
des amis sans esprit de conduite, vous verrez quelle jolie petite vie
vous mènerez un jour.
--Ah! madame, une femme a bien de la peine à être heureuse, n'est-ce
pas? s'écria naïvement la comtesse.
--Ma petite, il faut savoir choisir, à votre âge, entre les plaisirs et
le bonheur. Vous voulez épouser Martial, qui n'est ni assez sot pour
faire un bon mari, ni assez passionné pour être un amant. Il a des
dettes, ma chère, il est homme à dévorer votre fortune; mais ce ne
serait rien s'il vous donnait le bonheur. Ne voyez-vous combien il est
vieux? Cet homme doit avoir été souvent malade, il jouit de son reste.
Dans trois ans, ce sera un homme fini. L'ambitieux commencera, peut-être
réussira-t-il. Je ne le crois pas. Qu'est-il? un intrigant qui peut
posséder à merveille l'esprit des affaires et babiller agréablement;
mais il est trop avantageux pour avoir un vrai mérite, il n'ira pas
loin. D'ailleurs, regardez-le! Ne lit-on pas sur son front que, dans ce
moment-ci, ce n'est pas une jeune et jolie femme qu'il voit en vous,
mais les deux millions que vous possédez? Il ne vous aime pas, ma chère,
il vous calcule comme s'il s'agissait d'une affaire. Si vous voulez vous
marier, prenez un homme plus âgé, qui ait de la considération, et qui
soit à la moitié de son chemin. Une veuve ne doit pas faire de son
mariage une affaire d'amourette. Une souris s'attrape-t-elle deux fois
au même piége? Maintenant, un nouveau contrat doit être une spéculation
pour vous, et il faut, en vous remariant, avoir au moins l'espoir de
vous entendre nommer un jour madame la maréchale.
En ce moment, les yeux des deux femmes se fixèrent naturellement sur la
belle figure du colonel Montcornet.
--Si vous voulez jouer le rôle difficile d'une coquette et ne pas vous
marier, reprit la duchesse avec bonhomie, ah! ma pauvre petite, vous
saurez mieux que toute autre amonceler les nuages d'une tempête et la
dissiper. Mais, je vous en conjure, ne vous faites jamais un plaisir de
troubler la paix des ménages, de détruire l'union des familles et le
bonheur des femmes qui sont heureuses. Je l'ai joué, ma chère, ce rôle
dangereux. Hé, mon Dieu, pour un triomphe d'amour-propre, on assassine
souvent de pauvres créatures vertueuses; car il existe vraiment, ma
chère, des femmes vertueuses, et l'on se crée des haines mortelles. Un
peu trop tard, j'ai appris que, suivant l'expression du duc d'Albe, un
saumon vaut mieux que mille grenouilles! Certes, un véritable amour
donne mille fois plus de jouissances que les passions éphémères qu'on
excite! Eh bien! je suis venue ici pour vous prêcher. Oui, vous êtes la
cause de mon apparition dans ce salon qui pue le peuple. Ne viens-je pas
d'y voir des acteurs? Autrefois, ma chère, on les recevait dans son
boudoir; mais au salon, fi donc! Pourquoi me regardez-vous d'un air si
étonné? Écoutez-moi! Si vous voulez vous jouer des hommes, reprit la
vieille dame, ne bouleversez le coeur que de ceux dont la vie n'est pas
arrêtée, de ceux qui n'ont pas de devoirs à remplir; les autres ne nous
pardonnent pas les désordres qui les ont rendus heureux. Profitez de
cette maxime due à ma vieille expérience. Ce pauvre Soulanges, par
exemple, auquel vous avez fait tourner la tête, et que, depuis quinze
mois, vous avez enivré, Dieu sait comme! eh bien! savez-vous sur quoi
portaient vos coups?... sur sa vie tout entière. Il est marié depuis six
mois, il est adoré d'une charmante créature qu'il aime et qu'il trompe;
elle vit dans les larmes et dans le silence le plus amer. Soulanges a eu
des moments de remords plus cruels que ses plaisirs n'étaient doux. Et
vous, petite rusée, vous l'avez trahi. Eh bien! venez contempler votre
ouvrage.
La vieille duchesse prit la main de madame de Vaudremont, et elles se
levèrent.
--Tenez, lui dit madame de Grandlieu en lui montrant des yeux l'inconnue
pâle et tremblante sous les feux du lustre, voilà ma petite nièce, la
comtesse de Soulanges, elle a enfin cédé aujourd'hui à mes instances,
elle a consenti à quitter la chambre de douleur où la vue de son enfant
ne lui apportait que de bien faibles consolations; la voyez-vous? elle
vous paraît charmante: eh bien! chère belle, jugez de ce qu'elle devait
être quand le bonheur et l'amour répandaient leur éclat sur cette figure
maintenant flétrie.
La comtesse détourna silencieusement la tête et parut en proie à de
graves réflexions. La duchesse l'amena jusqu'à la porte de la salle de
jeu; puis, après y avoir jeté les yeux, comme si elle eût voulu y
chercher quelqu'un:--Et voilà Soulanges, dit-elle à la jeune coquette
d'un son de voix profond.
La comtesse frissonna quand elle aperçut, dans le coin le moins éclairé
du salon, la figure pâle et contractée de Soulanges appuyé sur la
causeuse: l'affaissement de ses membres et l'immobilité de son front
accusaient toute sa douleur, les joueurs allaient et venaient devant
lui, sans y faire plus d'attention que s'il eût été mort. Le tableau que
présentaient la femme en larmes et le mari morne et sombre, séparés l'un
de l'autre au milieu de cette fête, comme les deux moitiés d'un arbre
frappé par la foudre, eut peut-être quelque chose de prophétique pour la
comtesse. Elle craignit d'y voir une image des vengeances que lui
gardait l'avenir. Son coeur n'était pas encore assez flétri pour que la
sensibilité et l'indulgence en fussent entièrement bannies, elle pressa
la main de la duchesse en la remerciant par un de ces sourires qui ont
une certaine grâce enfantine.
--Mon cher enfant, lui dit la vieille femme à l'oreille, songez
désormais que nous savons aussi bien repousser les hommages des hommes
que nous les attirer.
--Elle est à vous, si vous n'êtes pas un niais.
Ces dernières paroles furent soufflées par madame de Grandlieu à
l'oreille du colonel Montcornet pendant que la belle comtesse se livrait
à la compassion que lui inspirait l'aspect de Soulanges, car elle
l'aimait encore assez sincèrement pour vouloir le rendre au bonheur, et
se promettait intérieurement d'employer l'irrésistible pouvoir
qu'exerçaient encore ses séductions sur lui pour le renvoyer à sa femme.
--Oh! comme je vais le prêcher, dit-elle à madame de Grandlieu.
--N'en faites rien, ma chère! s'écria la duchesse en regagnant sa
bergère, choisissez-vous un bon mari et fermez votre porte à mon neveu.
Ne lui offrez même pas votre amitié. Croyez-moi, mon enfant, une femme
ne reçoit pas d'une autre femme le coeur de son mari, elle est cent fois
plus heureuse de croire qu'elle l'a reconquis elle-même. En amenant ici
ma nièce, je crois lui avoir donné un excellent moyen de regagner
l'affection de son mari. Je ne vous demande, pour toute coopération, que
d'agacer le général.
Et, quand elle lui montra l'ami du maître des requêtes, la comtesse
sourit.
--Eh bien, madame, savez-vous enfin le nom de cette inconnue? demanda le
baron d'un air piqué à la comtesse quand elle se trouva seule.
--Oui, dit madame de Vaudremont en regardant le maître des requêtes.
Sa figure exprimait autant de finesse que de gaieté. Le sourire qui
répandait la vie sur ses lèvres et sur ses joues, la lumière humide de
ses yeux étaient semblables à ces feux follets qui abusent le voyageur.
Martial, qui se crut toujours aimé, prit alors cette attitude coquette
dans laquelle un homme se balance si complaisamment auprès de celle
qu'il aime, et dit avec fatuité:--Et ne m'en voudrez-vous pas si je
parais attacher beaucoup de prix à savoir ce nom?
--Et ne m'en voudrez-vous pas, répliqua madame de Vaudremont, si, par un
reste d'amour, je ne vous le dis pas, et si je vous défends de faire la
moindre avance à cette jeune dame? Vous risqueriez votre vie, peut-être.
--Madame, perdre vos bonnes grâces, n'est-ce pas perdre plus que la vie.
--Martial, dit sévèrement la comtesse, c'est madame de Soulanges, son
mari vous brûlerait la cervelle, si vous en avez toutefois.
--Ah! ah! répliqua le fat en riant, le colonel laissera vivre en paix
celui qui lui a enlevé votre coeur et se battrait pour sa femme. Quel
renversement de principes! Je vous en prie, permettez-moi de danser avec
cette petite dame. Vous pourrez ainsi avoir la preuve du peu d'amour que
renfermait pour vous ce coeur de neige, car si le colonel trouve mauvais
que je fasse danser sa femme, après avoir souffert que je vous...
--Mais elle aime son mari.
--Obstacle de plus que j'aurai le plaisir de vaincre.
--Mais elle est mariée.
--Plaisante objection!
--Ah! dit la comtesse avec un sourire amer, vous nous punissez également
de nos fautes et de nos repentirs.
--Ne vous fâchez pas, dit vivement Martial. Oh! je vous en supplie,
pardonnez-moi. Tenez, je ne pense plus à madame de Soulanges.
--Vous mériteriez bien que je vous envoyasse auprès d'elle.
--J'y vais, dit le baron en riant, et je reviendrai plus épris de vous
que jamais. Vous verrez que la plus jolie femme du monde ne peut
s'emparer d'un coeur qui vous appartient.
--C'est-à-dire que vous voulez gagner le cheval du colonel.
--Ah! le traître, répondit-il en riant et menaçant du doigt son ami qui
souriait.
Le colonel arriva, le baron lui céda la place auprès de la comtesse à
laquelle il dit d'un air sardonique:--Madame, voici un homme qui s'est
vanté de pouvoir gagner vos bonnes grâces dans une soirée.
Il s'applaudit en s'éloignant d'avoir révolté l'amour-propre de la
comtesse et desservi Montcornet; mais, malgré sa finesse habituelle, il
n'avait pas deviné l'ironie dont étaient empreints les propos de madame
de Vaudremont, et ne s'aperçut point qu'elle avait fait autant de pas
vers son ami que son ami vers elle, quoiqu'à l'insu l'un de l'autre. Au
moment où le maître des requêtes s'approchait en papillonnant du
candélabre sous lequel la comtesse de Soulanges, pâle et craintive,
semblait ne vivre que des yeux, son mari arriva près de la porte du
salon en montrant des yeux étincelants de passion. La vieille duchesse,
attentive à tout, s'élança vers son neveu, lui demanda son bras et sa
voiture pour sortir, en prétextant un ennui mortel et se flattant de
prévenir ainsi un éclat fâcheux. Elle fit, avant de partir, un singulier
signe d'intelligence à sa nièce, en lui désignant l'entreprenant
cavalier qui se préparait à lui parler, et ce signe semblait lui
dire:--Le voici, venge-toi.
Madame de Vaudremont surprit le regard de la tante et de la nièce, une
lueur soudaine illumina son âme, elle craignit d'être la dupe de cette
vieille dame si savante et si rusée en intrigue.--Cette perfide
duchesse, se dit-elle, aura peut-être trouvé plaisant de me faire de la
morale en me jouant quelque méchant tour de sa façon.
A cette pensée, l'amour-propre de madame de Vaudremont fut peut-être
encore plus fortement intéressé que sa curiosité à démêler le fil de
cette intrigue. La préoccupation intérieure à laquelle elle fut en proie
ne la laissa pas maîtresse d'elle-même. Le colonel, interprétant à son
avantage la gêne répandue dans les discours et les manières de la
comtesse, n'en devint que plus ardent et plus pressant. Les vieux
diplomates blasés, qui s'amusaient à observer le jeu des physionomies,
n'avaient jamais rencontré tant d'intrigues à suivre ou à deviner. Les
passions qui agitaient le double couple se diversifiaient à chaque pas
dans ces salons animés en se représentant avec d'autres nuances sur
d'autres figures. Le spectacle de tant de passions vives, toutes ces
querelles d'amour, ces vengeances douces, ces faveurs cruelles, ces
regards enflammés, toute cette vie brûlante répandue autour d'eux ne
leur faisait sentir que plus vivement leur impuissance. Enfin, le baron
avait pu s'asseoir auprès de la comtesse de Soulanges. Ses yeux erraient
à la dérobée sur un cou frais comme la rosée, parfumé comme une fleur
des champs. Il admirait de près des beautés qui de loin l'avaient
étonné. Il pouvait voir un petit pied bien chaussé, mesurer de l'oeil
une taille souple et gracieuse. A cette époque, les femmes nouaient la
ceinture de leurs robes précisément au-dessous du sein, à l'imitation
des statues grecques, mode impitoyable pour les femmes dont le corsage
avait quelque défaut. En jetant des regards furtifs sur ce sein, Martial
resta ravi de la perfection des formes de la comtesse.
--Vous n'avez pas dansé une seule fois ce soir, madame, dit-il d'une
voix douce et flatteuse; ce n'est pas faute de cavalier, j'imagine?
--Je ne vais point dans le monde, j'y suis inconnue, répondit avec
froideur madame de Soulanges qui n'avait rien compris au regard par
lequel sa tante venait de l'inviter à plaire au baron.
Martial fit alors jouer par maintien le beau diamant qui ornait sa main
gauche, les feux jetés par la pierre semblèrent jeter une lueur subite
dans l'âme de la jeune comtesse qui rougit et regarda le baron avec une
expression indéfinissable.
--Aimez-vous la danse? demanda le Provençal, pour essayer de renouer la
conversation.
--Oh! beaucoup, monsieur.
A cette étrange réponse, leurs regards se rencontrèrent. Le jeune homme,
surpris de l'accent pénétrant qui réveilla dans son coeur une vague
espérance, avait subitement interrogé les yeux de la jeune femme.
--Eh bien, madame, n'est-ce pas une témérité de ma part que de me
proposer pour être votre partner à la première contredanse?
Une confusion naïve rougit les joues blanches de la comtesse.
--Mais, monsieur, j'ai déjà refusé un danseur, un militaire...
--Serait-ce ce grand colonel de cavalerie que vous voyez là-bas?
--Précisément.
--Eh! c'est mon ami, ne craignez rien. M'accordez-vous la faveur que
j'ose espérer?
--Oui, monsieur.
Cette voix accusait une émotion si neuve et si profonde, que l'âme
blasée du maître des requêtes en fut ébranlée. Il se sentit envahi par
une timidité de lycéen, perdit son assurance, sa tête méridionale
s'enflamma, il voulut parler, ses expressions lui parurent sans grâce,
comparées aux reparties spirituelles et fines de madame de Soulanges. Il
fut heureux pour lui que la contredanse commençât. Debout près de sa
belle danseuse, il se trouva plus à l'aise. Pour beaucoup d'hommes, la
danse est une manière d'être; ils pensent, en déployant les grâces de
leur corps, agir plus puissamment que par l'esprit sur le coeur des
femmes. Le Provençal voulait sans doute employer en ce moment tous ces
moyens de séduction, à en juger par la prétention de tous ses mouvements
et de ses gestes. Il avait amené sa conquête au quadrille où les femmes
les plus brillantes du salon mettaient une chimérique importance à
danser préférablement à tout autre. Pendant que l'orchestre exécutait le
prélude de la première figure, le baron éprouvait une incroyable
satisfaction d'orgueil, quand, passant en revue les danseuses placées
sur les lignes de ce carré redoutable, il s'aperçut que la toilette de
madame de Soulanges défiait même celle de madame de Vaudremont qui, par
un hasard cherché peut-être, faisait avec le colonel le vis-à-vis du
baron et de la dame bleue. Les regards se fixèrent un moment sur madame
de Soulanges: un murmure flatteur annonça qu'elle était le sujet de la
conversation de chaque partner avec sa danseuse. Les oeillades d'envie
et d'admiration se croisaient si vivement sur elle, que la jeune femme,
honteuse d'un triomphe auquel elle semblait se refuser, baissa
modestement les yeux, rougit, et n'en devint que plus charmante. Si elle
releva ses blanches paupières, ce fut pour regarder son danseur enivré,
comme si elle eût voulu lui reporter la gloire de ces hommages et lui
dire qu'elle préférait le sien à tous les autres; elle mit de
l'innocence dans sa coquetterie, ou plutôt elle parut se livrer à la
naïve admiration par laquelle commence l'amour avec cette bonne foi qui
ne se rencontre que dans de jeunes coeurs. Quand elle dansa, les
spectateurs purent facilement croire qu'elle ne déployait ces grâces que
pour Martial; et, quoique modeste et neuve au manége des salons, elle
sut, aussi bien que la plus savante coquette, lever à propos les yeux
sur lui, les baisser avec une feinte modestie. Quand les lois nouvelles
d'une contredanse inventée par le danseur Trénis, et à laquelle il donna
son nom, amenèrent Martial devant le colonel:--J'ai gagné ton cheval,
lui dit-il en riant.
--Oui, mais tu as perdu quatre-vingt mille livres de rente, lui répliqua
le colonel en lui montrant madame de Vaudremont.
--Et qu'est-ce que cela me fait! répondit Martial, madame de Soulanges
vaut des millions.
A la fin de cette contredanse, plus d'un chuchotement résonnait à plus
d'une oreille. Les femmes les moins jolies faisaient de la morale avec
leurs danseurs, à propos de la naissante liaison de Martial et de la
comtesse de Soulanges. Les plus belles s'étonnaient d'une telle
facilité. Les hommes ne concevaient pas le bonheur du petit maître des
requêtes auquel ils ne trouvaient rien de bien séduisant. Quelques
femmes indulgentes disaient qu'il ne fallait pas se presser de juger la
comtesse: les jeunes personnes seraient bien malheureuses si un regard
expressif ou quelques pas gracieusement exécutés suffisaient pour
compromettre une femme. Martial seul connaissait l'étendue de son
bonheur. A la dernière figure, quand les dames du quadrille eurent à
former le moulinet, ses doigts pressèrent alors ceux de la comtesse, et
il crut sentir, à travers la peau fine et parfumée des gants, que les
doigts de la jeune femme répondaient à son amoureux appel.
--Madame, lui dit-il au moment où la contredanse se termina, ne
retournez pas dans cet odieux coin où vous avez enseveli jusqu'ici votre
figure et votre toilette. L'admiration est-elle le seul revenu que vous
puissiez tirer des diamants qui parent votre cou si blanc et vos nattes
si bien tressées? Venez faire une promenade dans les salons pour y jouir
de la fête et de vous-même.
Madame de Soulanges suivit son séducteur, qui pensait qu'elle lui
appartiendrait plus sûrement s'il parvenait à l'afficher. Tous deux, ils
firent alors quelques tours à travers les groupes qui encombraient les
salons de l'hôtel. La comtesse de Soulanges, inquiète, s'arrêtait un
instant avant d'entrer dans chaque salon, et n'y pénétrait qu'après
avoir tendu le cou pour jeter un regard sur tous les hommes. Cette peur,
qui comblait de joie le petit maître des requêtes, ne semblait calmée
que quand il avait dit à sa tremblante compagne:--Rassurez-vous, _il_
n'y est pas. Ils parvinrent ainsi jusqu'à une immense galerie de
tableaux, située dans une aile de l'hôtel, et où l'on jouissait par
avance du magnifique aspect d'un ambigu préparé pour trois cents
personnes. Comme le repas allait commencer, Martial entraîna la comtesse
vers un boudoir ovale donnant sur les jardins, et où les fleurs les plus
rares et quelques arbustes formaient un bocage parfumé sous de
brillantes draperies bleues. Le murmure de la fête venait y mourir. La
comtesse tressaillit en y entrant, et refusa obstinément d'y suivre le
jeune homme; mais, après avoir jeté les yeux sur une glace, elle y vit
sans doute des témoins, car elle alla s'asseoir d'assez bonne grâce sur
une ottomane.
--Cette pièce est délicieuse, dit-elle en admirant une tenture
bleu-de-ciel relevée par des perles.
--Tout y est amour et volupté, dit le jeune homme fortement ému.
A la faveur de la mystérieuse clarté qui régnait, il regarda la comtesse
et surprit sur sa figure doucement agitée une expression de trouble, de
pudeur, de désir qui l'enchanta. La jeune femme sourit, et ce sourire
sembla mettre fin à la lutte des sentiments qui se heurtaient dans son
coeur, elle prit de la manière la plus séduisante la main gauche de son
adorateur, et lui ôta du doigt la bague sur laquelle ses yeux s'étaient
arrêtés.
--Le beau diamant! s'écria-t-elle avec la naïve expression d'une jeune
fille qui laisse voir les chatouillements d'une première tentation.
Martial, ému de la caresse involontaire mais enivrante que la comtesse
lui avait faite en dégageant le brillant, arrêta sur elle des yeux aussi
étincelants que la bague.
--Portez-la, lui dit-il, en souvenir de cette heure céleste et pour
l'amour de...
--Elle le contemplait avec tant d'extase qu'il n'acheva pas, il lui
baisa la main.
--Vous me la donnez? dit-elle avec un air d'étonnement.
--Je voudrais vous offrir le monde entier.
--Vous ne plaisantez pas, reprit-elle d'une voix altérée par une
satisfaction trop vive.
--N'acceptez-vous que mon diamant?
--Vous ne me le reprendrez jamais? demanda-t-elle.
--Jamais.
Elle mit la bague à son doigt. Martial, comptant sur un prochain
bonheur, fit un geste pour passer sa main sur la taille de la comtesse
qui se leva tout à coup, et dit d'une voix claire, sans aucune
émotion:--Monsieur, j'accepte ce diamant avec d'autant moins de scrupule
qu'il m'appartient.
Le maître des requêtes resta tout interdit.
--Monsieur de Soulanges le prit dernièrement sur ma toilette et me dit
l'avoir perdu.
--Vous êtes dans l'erreur, madame, dit Martial d'un air piqué, je le
tiens de madame de Vaudremont.
--Précisément, répliqua-t-elle en souriant. Mon mari m'a emprunté cette
bague, la lui a donnée, elle vous en a fait présent, ma bague a voyagé,
voilà tout. Cette bague me dira peut-être tout ce que j'ignore, et
m'apprendra le secret de toujours plaire. Monsieur, reprit-elle, si elle
n'eût pas été à moi, soyez sûr que je ne me serais pas hasardée à la
payer si cher, car une jeune femme est, dit-on, en péril près de vous.
Mais, tenez, ajouta-t-elle en faisant jouer un ressort caché sous la
pierre, les cheveux de monsieur de Soulanges y sont encore.
Elle s'élança dans les salons avec une telle prestesse qu'il paraissait
inutile d'essayer de la rejoindre; et, d'ailleurs, Martial confondu ne
se trouva pas d'humeur à tenter l'aventure. Le rire de madame de
Soulanges avait trouvé un écho dans le boudoir où le jeune fat aperçut
entre deux arbustes le colonel et madame de Vaudremont qui riaient de
tout coeur.
--Veux-tu mon cheval pour courir après ta conquête? lui dit le colonel.
La bonne grâce avec laquelle le baron supporta les plaisanteries dont
l'accablèrent madame de Vaudremont et Montcornet, lui valut leur
discrétion sur cette soirée, où son ami troqua son cheval de bataille
contre une jeune, riche et jolie femme.
Pendant que la comtesse de Soulanges franchissait l'intervalle qui
sépare la Chaussée-d'Antin du faubourg Saint-Germain où elle demeurait,
son âme fut en proie aux plus vives inquiétudes. Avant de quitter
l'hôtel de Gondreville, elle en avait parcouru les salons sans y
rencontrer ni sa tante ni son mari partis sans elle. D'affreux
pressentiments vinrent alors tourmenter son âme ingénue. Témoin discret
des souffrances éprouvées par son mari depuis le jour où madame de
Vaudremont l'avait attaché à son char, elle espérait avec confiance
qu'un prochain repentir lui ramènerait son époux. Aussi était-ce avec
une incroyable répugnance qu'elle avait consenti au plan formé par sa
tante, madame de Grandlieu, et en ce moment elle craignait d'avoir
commis une faute. Cette soirée avait attristé son âme candide. Effrayée
d'abord de l'air souffrant et sombre du comte de Soulanges, elle le fut
encore plus par la beauté de sa rivale, et la corruption du monde lui
avait serré le coeur. En passant sur le Pont-Royal, elle jeta les
cheveux profanés qui se trouvaient sous le diamant, jadis offert comme
le gage d'un amour pur. Elle pleura en se rappelant les vives
souffrances auxquelles elle était depuis si longtemps en proie, et
frémit plus d'une fois en pensant que le devoir des femmes qui veulent
obtenir la paix en ménage les obligeait à ensevelir au fond du coeur, et
sans se plaindre, des angoisses aussi cruelles que les siennes.
--Hélas! se dit-elle, comment peuvent faire les femmes qui n'aiment pas?
Où est la source de leur indulgence? Je ne saurais croire, comme le dit
ma tante, que la raison suffise pour les soutenir dans de tels
dévouements.
Elle soupirait encore quand son chasseur abaissa l'élégant marchepied
d'où elle s'élança sous le vestibule de son hôtel. Elle monta l'escalier
avec précipitation, et quand elle arriva dans sa chambre, elle
tressaillit de terreur en y voyant son mari assis auprès de la cheminée.
--Depuis quand, ma chère, allez-vous au bal sans moi, sans me prévenir?
demanda-t-il d'une voix altérée. Sachez qu'une femme est toujours
déplacée sans son mari. Vous étiez singulièrement compromise dans le
coin obscur où vous vous étiez nichée.
--Oh! mon bon Léon, dit-elle d'une voix caressante, je n'ai pu résister
au bonheur de te voir sans que tu me visses. Ma tante m'a menée à ce
bal, et j'y ai été bien heureuse!
Ces accents désarmèrent les regards du comte de leur sévérité factice,
car il venait de se faire de vifs reproches à lui-même, en appréhendant
le retour de sa femme, sans doute instruite au bal d'une infidélité
qu'il espérait lui avoir cachée, et selon la coutume des amants qui se
sentent coupables, il essayait, en querellant la comtesse le premier,
d'éviter sa trop juste colère. Il regarda silencieusement sa femme, qui
dans sa brillante parure lui sembla plus belle que jamais. Heureuse de
voir son mari souriant, et de le trouver à cette heure dans une chambre
où, depuis quelque temps, il était venu moins fréquemment, la comtesse
le regarda si tendrement qu'elle rougit et baissa les yeux. Cette
clémence enivra d'autant plus Soulanges que cette scène succédait aux
tourments qu'il avait ressentis pendant le bal; il saisit la main de sa
femme et la baisa par reconnaissance: ne se rencontre-t-il pas souvent
de la reconnaissance dans l'amour?
--Hortense, qu'as-tu donc au doigt qui m'a fait tant de mal aux lèvres?
demanda-t-il en riant.
--C'est mon diamant, que tu disais perdu, et que j'ai retrouvé.
Le général Montcornet n'épousa point madame de Vaudremont, malgré la
bonne intelligence dans laquelle tous deux vécurent pendant quelques
instants, car elle fut une des victimes de l'épouvantable incendie qui
rendit à jamais célèbre le bal donné par l'ambassadeur d'Autriche, à
l'occasion du mariage de l'empereur Napoléon avec la fille de l'empereur
François II.
  Juillet 1829.
LA FAUSSE MAITRESSE.
  DÉDIÉ A LA COMTESSE CLARA MAFFEÏ.
Au mois de septembre 1835, une des plus riches héritières du faubourg
Saint-Germain, mademoiselle du Rouvre, fille unique du marquis du
Rouvre, épousa le comte Adam Mitgislas Laginski, jeune Polonais
proscrit.
Qu'il soit permis d'écrire les noms comme ils se prononcent, pour
épargner aux lecteurs l'aspect des fortifications de consonnes par
lesquelles la langue slave protége ses voyelles, sans doute afin de ne
pas les perdre, vu leur petit nombre.
Le marquis du Rouvre avait presque entièrement dissipé l'une des plus
belles fortunes de la noblesse, et à laquelle il dut autrefois son
alliance avec une demoiselle de Ronquerolles. Ainsi, du côté maternel,
Clémentine du Rouvre avait pour oncle le marquis de Ronquerolles, et
pour tante madame de Sérizy. Du côté paternel, elle jouissait d'un autre
oncle dans la bizarre personne du chevalier du Rouvre, cadet de la
maison, vieux garçon devenu riche en trafiquant sur les terres et sur
les maisons. Le marquis de Ronquerolles eut le malheur de perdre ses
deux enfants à l'invasion du choléra. Le fils unique de madame de
Sérizy, jeune militaire de la plus haute espérance, périt en Afrique à
l'affaire de la Macta. Aujourd'hui, les familles riches sont entre le
danger de ruiner leurs enfants si elles en ont trop, ou celui de
s'éteindre en s'en tenant à un ou deux, un singulier effet du Code civil
auquel Napoléon n'a pas songé. Par un effet du hasard, malgré les
dissipations insensées du marquis du Rouvre pour Florine, une des
plus charmantes actrices de Paris, Clémentine devint donc une héritière.
Le marquis de Ronquerolles, un des plus habiles diplomates de la
nouvelle dynastie; sa soeur, madame de Sérizy, et le chevalier du Rouvre
convinrent, pour sauver leurs fortunes des griffes du marquis, d'en
disposer en faveur de leur nièce, à laquelle ils promirent d'assurer, au
jour de son mariage, chacun dix mille francs de rente.
[Illustration:
MALAGA
(LA FAUSSE MAÎTRESSE.)]
Il est parfaitement inutile de dire que le Polonais, quoique réfugié, ne
coûtait absolument rien au gouvernement français. Le comte Adam
appartient à l'une des plus vieilles et des plus illustres familles de
la Pologne, alliée à la plupart des maisons princières de l'Allemagne,
aux Sapiéha, aux Radzivill, aux Rzewuski, aux Cartoriski, aux Leczinski,
aux Iablonoski, etc. Mais les connaissances héraldiques ne sont pas ce
qui distingue la France sous Louis-Philippe, et cette noblesse ne
pouvait être une recommandation auprès de la bourgeoisie qui trônait
alors. D'ailleurs, quand, en 1833, Adam se montra sur le boulevard des
Italiens, à Frascati, au Jockey-Club, il mena la vie d'un jeune homme
qui, perdant ses espérances politiques, retrouvait ses vices et son
amour pour le plaisir. On le prit pour un étudiant. La nationalité
polonaise, par l'effet d'une odieuse réaction gouvernementale, était
alors tombée aussi bas que les républicains la voulaient mettre haut. La
lutte étrange du Mouvement contre la Résistance, deux mots qui seront
inexplicables dans trente ans, fit un jouet de ce qui devait être si
respectable: le nom d'une nation vaincue à qui la France accordait
l'hospitalité, pour qui l'on inventait des fêtes, pour qui l'on chantait
et l'on dansait par souscription; enfin une nation qui, lors de la lutte
entre l'Europe et la France, lui avait offert six mille hommes en 1796,
et quels hommes! N'allez pas inférer de ceci que l'on veuille donner
tort à l'empereur Nicolas contre la Pologne, ou à la Pologne contre
l'empereur Nicolas. Ce serait d'abord une assez sotte chose que de
glisser des discussions politiques dans un récit qui doit ou amuser ou
intéresser. Puis, la Russie et la Pologne avaient également raison,
l'une de vouloir l'unité de son empire, l'autre de vouloir redevenir
libre. Disons en passant que la Pologne pouvait conquérir la Russie par
l'influence de ses moeurs, au lieu de la combattre par les armes, en
imitant les Chinois, qui ont fini par chinoiser les Tartares, et qui
chinoiseront les Anglais, il faut l'espérer. La Pologne devait poloniser
la Russie: Poniatowski l'avait essayé dans la région la moins tempérée
de l'empire; mais ce gentilhomme fut un roi d'autant plus incompris que
peut-être ne se comprenait-il pas bien lui-même. Comment n'aurait-on pas
haï de pauvres gens qui furent la cause de l'horrible mensonge commis
pendant la revue où tout Paris demandait à secourir la Pologne? On
feignit de regarder les Polonais comme les alliés du parti républicain,
sans songer que la Pologne était une république aristocratique. Dès lors
la bourgeoisie accabla de ses ignobles dédains le Polonais que l'on
déifiait quelques jours auparavant. Le vent d'une émeute a toujours fait
varier les Parisiens du Nord au Midi, sous tous les régimes. Il faut
bien rappeler ces revirements de l'opinion parisienne pour expliquer
comment le mot Polonais était, en 1835, un qualificatif dérisoire chez
le peuple qui se croit le plus spirituel et le plus poli du monde, au
centre des lumières, dans une ville qui tient aujourd'hui le sceptre des
arts et de la littérature. Il existe, hélas! deux sortes de Polonais
réfugiés, le Polonais républicain, fils de Lelewel, et le noble Polonais
du parti à la tête duquel se place le prince Cartoriski. Ces deux sortes
de Polonais sont l'eau et le feu; mais pourquoi leur en vouloir? Ces
divisions ne se sont-elles pas toujours remarquées chez les réfugiés, à
quelque nation qu'ils appartiennent, n'importe en quelles contrées ils
aillent? On porte son pays et ses haines avec soi. A Bruxelles, deux
prêtres français émigrés manifestaient une profonde horreur l'un contre
l'autre, et quand on demanda pourquoi à l'un d'eux, il répondit en
montrant son compagnon de misère: «C'est un janséniste.» Dante eût
volontiers poignardé dans son exil un adversaire des Blancs. Là gît la
raison des attaques dirigées contre le vénérable prince Adam Cartoriski
par les radicaux français, et celle de la défaveur répandue sur une
partie de l'émigration polonaise par les César de boutique et les
Alexandre de la patente. En 1834, Adam Mitgislas Laginski eut donc
contre lui les plaisanteries parisiennes.
--Il est gentil, quoique Polonais, disait de lui Rastignac.
--Tous ces Polonais se prétendent grands seigneurs, disait Maxime de
Trailles, mais celui-ci paie ses dettes de jeu; je commence à croire
qu'il a eu des terres.
Sans vouloir offenser des bannis, il est permis de faire observer que la
légèreté, l'insouciance, l'inconsistance du caractère sarmate
autorisèrent les médisances des Parisiens qui d'ailleurs ressembleraient
parfaitement aux Polonais en semblable occurrence. L'aristocratie
française, si admirablement secourue par l'aristocratie polonaise
pendant la révolution, n'a certes pas rendu la pareille à l'émigration
forcée de 1832. Ayons le triste courage de le dire, le faubourg
Saint-Germain est encore débiteur de la Pologne.
Le comte Adam était-il riche, était-il pauvre, était-ce un aventurier?
Ce problème resta pendant long-temps indécis. Les salons de la
diplomatie, fidèles à leurs instructions, imitèrent le silence de
l'empereur Nicolas, qui considérait alors comme mort tout émigré
polonais. Les Tuileries et la plupart de ceux qui y prennent leur mot
d'ordre donnèrent une horrible preuve de cette qualité politique décorée
du titre de sagesse. On y méconnut un prince russe avec qui l'on fumait
des cigares pendant l'émigration, parce qu'il paraissait avoir encouru
la disgrâce de l'empereur Nicolas. Placés entre la prudence de la cour
et celle de la diplomatie, les Polonais de distinction vivaient dans la
solitude biblique de _Super flumina Babylonis_, ou hantaient certains
salons qui servent de terrain neutre à toutes les opinions. Dans une
ville de plaisir comme Paris, où les distractions abondent à tous les
étages, l'étourderie polonaise trouva deux fois plus de motifs qu'il ne
lui en fallait pour mener la vie dissipée des garçons. Enfin, disons-le,
Adam eut d'abord contre lui sa tournure et ses manières. Il y a deux
Polonais comme il y a deux Anglaises. Quand une Anglaise n'est pas
très-belle, elle est horriblement laide, et le comte Adam appartient à
la seconde catégorie. Sa petite figure, assez aigre de ton, semble avoir
été pressée dans un étau. Son nez court, ses cheveux blonds, ses
moustaches et sa barbe rousses lui donnent d'autant plus l'air d'une
chèvre qu'il est petit, maigre, et que ses yeux d'un jaune sale vous
saisissent par ce regard oblique si célèbre par le vers de Virgile.
Comment, malgré tant de conditions défavorables, possède-t-il des
manières et un ton exquis? La solution de ce problème s'explique et par
une tenue de dandy et par l'éducation due à sa mère, une Radziwill. Si
son courage va jusqu'à la témérité, son esprit ne dépasse point les
plaisanteries courantes et éphémères de la conversation parisienne; mais
il ne rencontre pas souvent parmi les jeunes gens à la mode un garçon
qui lui soit supérieur. Les gens du monde causent aujourd'hui beaucoup
trop chevaux, revenus, impôts, députés pour que la conversation
française reste ce qu'elle fut. L'esprit veut du loisir et certaines
inégalités de position. On cause peut-être mieux à Pétersbourg et à
Vienne qu'à Paris. Des égaux n'ont plus besoin de finesses, ils se
disent alors tout _bêtement_ les choses comme elles sont. Les moqueurs
de Paris retrouvèrent donc difficilement un grand seigneur dans une
espèce d'étudiant léger qui, dans le discours, passait avec insouciance
d'un sujet à un autre, qui courait après les amusements avec d'autant
plus de fureur qu'il venait d'échapper à de grands périls, et que, sorti
de son pays où sa famille était connue, il se crut libre de mener une
vie décousue sans courir les risques de la déconsidération.
Un beau jour, en 1834, Adam acheta, rue de la Pépinière, un hôtel. Six
mois après cette acquisition, sa tenue égala celle des plus riches
maisons de Paris. Au moment où Laginski commençait à se faire prendre au
sérieux, il vit Clémentine aux Italiens et devint amoureux d'elle. Un an
après, le mariage eut lieu. Le salon de madame d'Espard donna le signal
des louanges. Les mères de famille apprirent trop tard que, dès l'an
neuf cent, les Laginski se comptaient parmi les familles illustres du
Nord. Par un trait de prudence anti-polonaise, la mère du jeune comte
avait, au moment de l'insurrection, hypothéqué ses biens d'une somme
immense prêtée par deux maisons juives et placée dans les fonds
français. Le comte Adam Laginski possédait quatre-vingt mille francs de
rente. On ne s'étonna plus de l'imprudence avec laquelle, selon beaucoup
de salons, madame de Sérizy, le vieux diplomate Ronquerolles et le
chevalier du Rouvre cédaient à la folle passion de leur nièce. On passa,
comme toujours, d'un extrême à l'autre. Pendant l'hiver de 1836 le comte
Adam fut à la mode, et Clémentine Laginska devint une des reines de
Paris. Madame de Laginska fait aujourd'hui partie de ce charmant groupe
de jeunes femmes où brillent mesdames de l'Estorade, de Portenduère,
Marie de Vandenesse, du Guénic et de Maufrigneuse, les fleurs du Paris
actuel, qui vivent à une grande distance des parvenus, des bourgeois et
des faiseurs de la nouvelle politique.
Ce préambule était nécessaire pour déterminer la sphère dans laquelle
s'est passée une de ces actions sublimes, moins rares que les
détracteurs du temps présent ne le croient, qui sont, comme les belles
perles, le fruit d'une souffrance ou d'une douleur, et qui, semblables
aux perles, sont cachées sous de rudes écailles, perdues enfin au fond
de ce gouffre, de cette mer, de cette onde incessamment remuée, nommée
le monde, le siècle, Paris, Londres ou Pétersbourg, comme vous voudrez!
Si jamais cette vérité, que l'architecture est l'expression des moeurs,
fut démontrée, n'est-ce pas depuis l'insurrection de 1830, sous le règne
de la maison d'Orléans? Toutes les fortunes se rétrécissant en France,
les majestueux hôtels de nos pères sont incessamment démolis et
remplacés par des espèces de phalanstères où le pair de France de
Juillet habite un troisième étage au-dessus d'un empirique enrichi. Les
styles sont confusément employés. Comme il n'existe plus de cour, ni de
noblesse pour donner le ton, on ne voit aucun ensemble dans les
productions de l'art. De son côté, jamais l'architecture n'a découvert
plus de moyens économiques pour singer le vrai, le solide, et n'a
déployé plus de ressources, plus de génie dans les distributions.
Proposez à un artiste la lisière du jardin d'un vieil hôtel abattu, il
vous y bâtit un petit Louvre écrasé d'ornements; il y trouve une cour,
des écuries, et si vous y tenez, un jardin; à l'intérieur, il accumule
tant de petites pièces et de dégagements, il sait si bien tromper
l'oeil, qu'on s'y croit à l'aise; enfin il y foisonne tant de logements,
qu'une famille ducale fait ses évolutions dans l'ancien fournil d'un
président à mortier.
L'hôtel de la comtesse Laginska, rue de la Pépinière, une de ces
créations modernes, est entre cour et jardin. A droite, dans la cour,
s'étendent les communs, auxquels répondent à gauche les remises et les
écuries. La loge du concierge s'élève entre deux charmantes portes
cochères. Le grand luxe de cette maison consiste en une charmante serre
agencée à la suite d'un boudoir au rez-de-chaussée, où se déploient
d'admirables appartements de réception. Un philanthrope chassé
d'Angleterre avait bâti cette bijouterie architecturale, construit la
serre, dessiné le jardin, verni les portes, briqueté les communs, verdi
les fenêtres, et réalisé l'un de ces rêves pareils, toute proportion
gardée, à celui de Georges IV à Brighton. Le fécond, l'industrieux, le
rapide ouvrier de Paris lui avait sculpté ses portes et ses fenêtres. On
lui avait imité les plafonds du moyen âge ou ceux des palais vénitiens,
et prodigué les placages de marbre en tableaux extérieurs. Elschoët et
Klagmann travaillèrent les dessus de portes et les cheminées. Boulanger
avait magistralement peint les plafonds. Les merveilles de l'escalier,
blanc comme le bras d'une femme, défiaient celles de l'hôtel
Rothschild. A cause des émeutes, le prix de cette folie ne monta pas à
plus de onze cent mille francs. Pour un Anglais ce fut donné. Tout ce
luxe, dit princier par des gens qui ne savent plus ce qu'est un vrai
prince, tenait dans l'ancien jardin de l'hôtel d'un fournisseur, un des
Crésus de la révolution, mort à Bruxelles en faillite après un sens
dessus-dessous de Bourse. L'Anglais mourut à Paris de Paris, car pour
bien des gens Paris est une maladie; il est quelquefois plusieurs
maladies. Sa veuve, une méthodiste, manifesta la plus grande horreur
pour la petite maison du nabab. Ce philanthrope était un marchand
d'opium. La pudique veuve ordonna de vendre le scandaleux immeuble au
moment où les émeutes mettaient en question la paix à tout prix. Le
comte Adam profita de cette occasion, vous saurez comment, car rien
n'était moins dans ses habitudes de grand seigneur.
Derrière cette maison, bâtie en pierre brodée comme melon, s'étale le
velours vert d'une pelouse anglaise, ombragée au fond par un élégant
massif d'arbres exotiques, d'où s'élance un pavillon chinois avec ses
clochettes muettes et ses oeufs dorés immobiles. La serre et ses
constructions fantastiques déguisent le mur de clôture au midi. L'autre
mur qui fait face à la serre est caché par des plantes grimpantes,
façonnées en portiques à l'aide de mâts peints en vert et réunis par des
traverses. Cette prairie, ce monde de fleurs, ces allées sablées, ce
simulacre de forêt, ces palissades aériennes se développent dans
vingt-cinq perches carrées, qui valent aujourd'hui quatre cent mille
francs, la valeur d'une vraie forêt. Au milieu de ce silence obtenu dans
Paris, les oiseaux chantent: il y a des merles, des rossignols, des
bouvreuils, des fauvettes, et beaucoup de moineaux. La serre est une
immense jardinière où l'air est chargé de parfums, où l'on se promène en
hiver comme si l'été brillait de tous ses feux. Les moyens par lesquels
on compose une atmosphère à sa guise, la Torride, la Chine ou l'Italie,
sont habilement dérobés aux regards. Les tubes où circulent l'eau
bouillante, la vapeur, un calorique quelconque, sont enveloppés de terre
et se produisent aux regards comme des guirlandes de fleurs vivantes.
Vaste est le boudoir. Sur un terrain restreint, le miracle de cette fée
parisienne, appelée l'Architecture, est de rendre tout grand. Le boudoir
de la jeune comtesse fut la coquetterie de l'artiste, à qui le comte
Adam livra l'hôtel à décorer de nouveau. Une faute y est impossible: il
y a trop de jolis riens. L'amour ne saurait où se poser parmi des
travailleuses sculptées en Chine, où l'oeil aperçoit des milliers de
figures bizarres fouillées dans l'ivoire et dont la génération a usé
deux familles chinoises; des coupes de topaze brûlée montées sur un pied
de filigrane; des mosaïques qui inspirent le vol; des tableaux
hollandais comme en refait Meissonnier; des anges conçus comme les
exécute Gérard-Séguin qui ne veut pas vendre les siens; des statuettes
sculptées par des génies poursuivis par leurs créanciers (véritable
explication des mythes arabes); les sublimes ébauches de nos premiers
artistes; des devants de bahut pour boiseries et dont les panneaux
alternent avec les fantaisies de la soierie indienne; des portières qui
s'échappent en flots dorés de dessous une traverse en chêne noir où
grouille une chasse entière; des meubles dignes de madame de Pompadour;
un tapis de Perse, etc. Enfin, dernière grâce, ces richesses éclairées
par un demi-jour qui filtre à travers deux rideaux de dentelle, en
paraissaient encore plus charmantes. Sur une console, parmi des
antiquités, une cravache dont le bout fut sculpté par mademoiselle de
Fauveau, disait que la comtesse aimait à monter à cheval.
Tel est un boudoir en 1837, un étalage de marchandises qui divertissent
les regards, comme si l'ennui menaçait la société la plus remueuse et la
plus remuée du monde. Pourquoi rien d'intime, rien qui porte à la
rêverie, au calme? Pourquoi? personne n'est sûr de son lendemain, et
chacun jouit de la vie en usufruitier prodigue.
Par une matinée, Clémentine se donnait l'air de réfléchir, étalée sur
une de ces méridiennes merveilleuses d'où l'on ne peut pas se lever,
tant le tapissier qui les inventa sut saisir les rondeurs de la paresse
et les aises du _far niente_. Les portes de la serre ouvertes laissaient
pénétrer les odeurs de la végétation et les parfums du tropique. La
jeune femme regardait Adam fumant devant elle un élégant narguilé, la
seule manière de fumer qu'elle eût permise dans cet appartement. Les
portières, pincées par d'élégantes embrasses, ouvraient au regard deux
magnifiques salons, l'un blanc et or, comparable à celui de l'hôtel
Forbin-Janson, l'autre en style de la renaissance. La salle à manger,
qui n'a de rivale à Paris que celle du marquis de Custine, se trouve au
bout d'une petite galerie plafonnée et décorée dans le genre moyen âge.
La galerie est précédée du côté de la cour, par une grande antichambre
d'où l'on aperçoit à travers les portes en glaces les merveilles de
l'escalier.
Le comte et la comtesse venaient de déjeuner, le ciel offrait une nappe
d'azur sans le moindre nuage, le mois d'avril finissait. Ce ménage
comptait deux ans de bonheur, et Clémentine avait depuis deux jours
seulement découvert dans sa maison quelque chose qui ressemblait à un
secret, à un mystère. Le Polonais, disons-le encore à sa gloire, est
généralement faible devant la femme; il est si plein de tendresse pour
elle, qu'il lui devient inférieur en Pologne; et quoique les Polonaises
soient d'admirables femmes, le Polonais est encore plus promptement mis
en déroute par une Parisienne. Aussi le comte Adam, pressé de questions,
n'eut-il pas l'innocente rouerie de vendre le secret à sa femme. Avec
une femme, il faut toujours tirer parti d'un secret; elle vous en sait
gré, comme un fripon accorde son respect à l'honnête homme qu'il n'a pas
pu jouer. Plus brave que parleur, le comte avait seulement stipulé de ne
répondre qu'après avoir fini son narguilé plein de Tombaki.
--En voyage, disait-elle, à toute difficulté tu me répondais par: «Paz
arrangera cela!» tu n'écrivais qu'à Paz! De retour ici, tout le monde me
dit: «_le capitaine!_» Je veux sortir?... _le capitaine!_ S'agit-il
d'acquitter un mémoire, _le capitaine!_ Mon cheval a-t-il le trot dur,
on en parle au _capitaine_ Paz. Enfin, ici, c'est pour moi comme au jeu
de domino: il y a Paz partout. Je n'entends parler que de Paz, et je ne
peux pas voir Paz. Qu'est-ce que c'est que Paz? Qu'on m'apporte notre
Paz.
--Tout ne va donc pas bien? dit le comte en quittant le _bocchettino_ de
son narguilé.
--Tout va si bien, qu'avec deux cent mille francs de rente on se
ruinerait à mener le train que nous avons avec cent dix mille francs,
dit-elle.
Elle tira le riche cordon de sonnette fait au petit point, une
merveille. Un valet de chambre habillé comme un ministre vint aussitôt.
--Dites à monsieur le capitaine Paz que je désire lui parler.
--Si vous croyez apprendre quelque chose ainsi!... dit en souriant le
comte Adam.
Il n'est pas inutile de faire observer qu'Adam et Clémentine, mariés au
mois de décembre 1835, étaient allés, après avoir passé l'hiver à Paris,
en Italie, en Suisse et en Allemagne pendant l'année 1836. Revenue au
mois de novembre, la comtesse reçut pour la première fois pendant
l'hiver qui venait de finir, et s'aperçut bien de l'existence
quasi-muette, effacée, mais salutaire d'un factotum dont la personne
paraissait invisible, ce capitaine Paz (Paç), dont le nom se prononce
comme il est écrit.
--Monsieur le capitaine Paz prie madame la comtesse de l'excuser, il est
aux écuries, et dans un costume qui ne lui permet pas de venir à
l'instant; mais une fois habillé, le comte Paz se présentera, dit le
valet de chambre.
--Que faisait-il donc?
--Il montrait comment doit se panser le cheval de madame, que Constantin
ne brossait pas à sa fantaisie, répondit le valet de chambre.
La comtesse regarda son domestique: il était sérieux et se gardait bien
de commenter sa phrase par le sourire que se permettent les inférieurs
en parlant d'un supérieur qui leur paraît descendu jusqu'à eux.
--Ah! il brossait Cora.
--Madame la comtesse ne monte-t-elle pas à cheval ce matin?
Le valet de chambre s'en alla sans réponse.
--Est-ce un Polonais? demanda Clémentine à son mari qui inclina la tête
en manière d'affirmation.
Clémentine Laginska resta muette en examinant Adam. Les pieds presque
tendus sur un coussin, la tête dans la position de celle d'un oiseau qui
écoute au bord de son nid les bruits du bocage, elle eût paru ravissante
à un homme blasé. Blonde et mince, les cheveux à l'anglaise, elle
ressemblait alors à ces figures quasi-fabuleuses des keepsakes, surtout
vêtue de son peignoir en soie façon de Perse, dont les plis touffus ne
déguisaient pas si bien les trésors de son corps et la finesse de la
taille qu'on ne pût les admirer à travers ces voiles épais de fleurs et
de broderies. En se croisant sur la poitrine, l'étoffe aux brillantes
couleurs laissait voir le bas du cou, dont les tons blancs contrastaient
avec ceux d'une riche guipure appliquée sur les épaules. Les yeux,
bordés de cils noirs, ajoutaient à l'expression de curiosité qui
fronçait une jolie bouche. Sur le front bien modelé, l'on remarquait les
rondeurs caractéristiques de la Parisienne volontaire, rieuse,
instruite, mais inaccessible à des séductions vulgaires. Ses mains
pendaient au bout de chaque bras de son fauteuil, presque transparentes.
Ses doigts en fuseaux et retroussés du bout montraient des ongles,
espèces d'amandes roses, où s'arrêtait la lumière. Adam souriait de
l'impatience de sa femme, et la regardait d'un oeil que la satiété
conjugale ne tiédissait pas encore. Déjà cette petite comtesse fluette
avait su se rendre maîtresse chez elle, car elle répondit à peine aux
admirations d'Adam. Dans ses regards jetés à la dérobée sur lui,
peut-être y avait-il déjà la conscience de la supériorité d'une
Parisienne sur ce Polonais mièvre, maigre et rouge.
--Voilà Paz, dit le comte en entendant un pas qui retentissait dans la
galerie.
La comtesse vit entrer un grand bel homme, bien fait, qui portait sur sa
figure les traces de cette douceur, fruit de la force et du courage. Paz
avait mis à la hâte une de ces redingotes serrées, à brandebourgs
attachés par des olives, qui jadis s'appelaient des polonaises.
D'abondants cheveux noirs assez mal peignés entouraient sa tête carrée,
et Clémentine put voir, brillant comme un bloc de marbre, un front
large, car Paz tenait à la main une casquette à visière. Cette main
ressemblait à celle de l'Hercule à l'Enfant. La santé la plus robuste
fleurissait sur ce visage également partagé par un grand nez romain qui
rappela les beaux Trasteverins à Clémentine. Une cravate en taffetas
noir achevait de donner une tournure martiale à ce mystère de cinq pieds
sept pouces aux yeux de jais et d'un éclat italien. L'ampleur d'un
pantalon à plis qui ne laissait voir que le bout des bottes, trahissait
le culte de Paz pour les modes de la Pologne. Vraiment, pour une femme
romanesque, il y aurait eu du burlesque dans le contraste si heurté qui
se remarquait entre le capitaine et le comte, entre ce petit Polonais à
figure étroite et ce beau militaire, entre ce paladin et ce palatin.
--Bonjour, Adam, dit-il familièrement au comte.
Puis il s'inclina gracieusement en demandant à Clémentine en quoi il
pouvait la servir.
--Vous êtes donc l'ami de Laginski? dit la jeune femme.
--A la vie, à la mort, répondit Paz, à qui le jeune comte jeta le plus
affectueux sourire en lançant sa dernière bouffée de fumée odorante.
--Eh bien! pourquoi ne mangez-vous pas avec nous? pourquoi ne nous
avez-vous pas accompagnés en Italie et en Suisse? pourquoi vous
cachez-vous ici de manière à vous dérober aux remerciements que je vous
dois pour les services constants que vous nous rendez? dit la jeune
comtesse avec une sorte de vivacité, mais sans la moindre émotion.
En effet, elle démêlait en Paz une sorte de servitude volontaire. Cette
idée n'allait pas alors sans une sorte de mésestime pour un amphibie
social, un être à la fois secrétaire et intendant, ni tout à fait
intendant ni tout à fait secrétaire, quelque parent pauvre; un ami
gênant.
--C'est, comtesse, répondit-il assez librement, qu'il n'y a pas de
remerciements à me faire: je suis l'ami d'Adam, et je mets mon plaisir à
prendre soin de ses intérêts.
--Tu restes debout pour ton plaisir aussi, dit le comte Adam.
Paz s'assit sur un fauteuil auprès de la portière.
--Je me souviens de vous avoir vu lors de mon mariage, et quelquefois
dans la cour, dit la jeune femme. Mais pourquoi vous placer dans une
condition d'infériorité, vous, l'ami d'Adam?
--L'opinion des Parisiens m'est tout à fait indifférente, dit-il. Je vis
pour moi, ou, si vous voulez, pour vous deux.
--Mais l'opinion du monde sur l'ami de mon mari ne peut pas m'être
indifférente...
--Oh! madame, le monde est bientôt satisfait avec ce mot: c'est un
original! Dites-le.
Un moment de silence.
--Comptez-vous sortir, demanda-t-il.
--Voulez-vous venir au bois? répondit la comtesse.
--Volontiers.
Sur ce mot, Paz sortit en saluant.
--Quel bon être! il a la simplicité d'un enfant, dit Adam.
--Racontez-moi maintenant vos relations avec lui, demanda Clémentine.
--Paz, ma chère âme, dit Laginski, est d'une noblesse aussi vieille et
aussi illustre que la nôtre. Lors de leurs désastres, un des Pazzi se
sauva de Florence en Pologne, où il s'établit avec quelque fortune, et y
fonda la famille Paz, à laquelle on a donné le titre de comte. Cette
famille, qui s'est distinguée dans les beaux jours de notre république
royale, est devenue riche. La bouture de l'arbre abattu en Italie a
poussé si vigoureusement, qu'il y a plusieurs branches de la maison
comtale des Paz. Ce n'est donc pas t'apprendre quelque chose
d'extraordinaire que de te dire qu'il existe des Paz riches et des Paz
pauvres. Notre Paz est le rejeton d'une branche pauvre. Orphelin, sans
autre fortune que son épée, il servait dans le régiment du grand-duc
Constantin lors de notre révolution. Entraîné dans le parti polonais,
il s'est battu comme un Polonais, comme un patriote, comme un homme qui
n'a rien: trois raisons pour se bien battre. A la dernière affaire, il
se crut suivi par ses soldats et courut sur une batterie russe, il fut
pris. J'étais là. Ce trait de courage m'anime:--Allons le chercher!
dis-je à mes cavaliers. Nous chargeons sur la batterie en fourrageurs,
et je délivre Paz, moi septième. Nous étions partis vingt, nous revînmes
huit, y compris Paz. Varsovie une fois vendue, il a fallu songer à
échapper aux Russes. Par un singulier hasard, Paz et moi nous nous
sommes trouvés ensemble, à la même heure, au même endroit, de l'autre
côté de la Vistule. Je vis arrêter ce pauvre capitaine par des Prussiens
qui se sont faits alors les chiens de chasse des Russes. Quand on a
repêché un homme dans le Styx, on y tient. Ce nouveau danger de Paz me
fit tant de peine, que je me laissai prendre avec lui dans l'intention
de le servir. Deux hommes peuvent se sauver là où un seul périt. Grâce à
mon nom et à quelques liaisons de parenté avec ceux de qui notre sort
dépendait, car nous étions alors entre les mains des Prussiens, on ferma
les yeux sur mon évasion. Je fis passer mon cher capitaine pour un
soldat sans importance, pour un homme de ma maison, et nous avons pu
gagner Dantzick. Nous nous y fourrâmes dans un navire hollandais partant
pour Londres, où deux mois après nous abordâmes. Ma mère était tombée
malade en Angleterre, et m'y attendait; Paz et moi, nous l'avons soignée
jusqu'à sa mort, que les catastrophes de notre entreprise avancèrent.
Nous avons quitté Londres, et j'emmenai Paz en France. En de pareilles
adversités, deux hommes deviennent frères. Quand je me suis vu dans
Paris, à vingt-deux ans, riche de soixante et quelques mille francs de
rentes, sans compter les restes d'une somme provenant des diamants et
des tableaux de famille vendus par ma mère, je voulus assurer le sort de
Paz avant de me livrer aux dissipations de la vie à Paris. J'avais
surpris un peu de tristesse dans les yeux du capitaine, quelquefois il y
roulait des larmes contenues. J'avais eu l'occasion d'apprécier son âme,
qui est foncièrement noble, grande, généreuse. Peut-être regrettait-il
de se voir lié par des bienfaits à un jeune homme de six ans moins âgé
que lui, sans avoir pu s'acquitter envers lui. Insouciant et léger comme
l'est un garçon, je devais me ruiner au jeu, me laisser entortiller par
quelque Parisienne, Paz et moi nous pouvions être un jour désunis. Tout
en me promettant de pourvoir à tous ses besoins, j'apercevais bien des
chances d'oublier ou d'être hors d'état de payer la pension de Paz.
Enfin, mon ange, je voulus lui épargner la peine, la pudeur, la honte de
me demander de l'argent ou de chercher vainement son compagnon dans un
jour de détresse. _Dunquè_, un matin, après déjeuner, les pieds sur les
chenets, fumant chacun notre pipe, après avoir bien rougi, pris bien des
précautions, le voyant me regarder avec inquiétude, je lui tendis une
inscription de rentes au porteur de deux mille quatre cents francs.
Clémentine quitta sa place, alla s'asseoir sur les genoux d'Adam, lui
passa son bras autour du cou, le baisa au front en lui disant:--Cher
trésor, combien je te trouve beau!--Et qu'a fait Paz?
--Thaddée, reprit le comte, a pâli sans rien dire...
--Ah! il se nomme Thaddée?
--Oui, Thaddée a replié le papier, me l'a rendu en me disant:--J'ai cru,
Adam, que c'était entre nous à la vie, à la mort, et que nous ne nous
quitterions jamais, tu ne veux donc pas de moi?--Ah! fis-je, tu
l'entends ainsi, Thaddée, eh! bien, n'en parlons plus. Si je me ruine,
tu seras ruiné.--Tu n'as pas, me dit-il, assez de fortune pour vivre en
Laginski, ne te faut-il pas alors un ami qui s'occupe de tes affaires,
qui soit un père et un frère, un confident sûr? Ma chère enfant, en me
disant ces paroles, Paz a eu dans le regard et dans la voix un calme qui
couvrait une émotion maternelle, mais qui révélait une reconnaissance
d'Arabe, un dévouement de caniche, une amitié de sauvage, sans faste et
toujours prête. Ma foi, je l'ai pris comme nous nous prenons, nous
autres Polonais, la main sur l'épaule, et je l'embrassai sur les
lèvres:--A la vie et à la mort, donc! Tout ce que j'ai t'appartient, et
fais comme tu voudras! C'est lui qui m'a trouvé cet hôtel pour presque
rien. Il a vendu mes rentes en hausse, les a rachetées en baisse, et
nous avons payé cette baraque avec les bénéfices. Connaisseur en
chevaux, il en trafique si bien que mon écurie coûte fort peu de chose,
et j'ai les plus beaux chevaux, les plus charmants équipages de Paris.
Nos gens, braves soldats polonais choisis par lui, passeraient dans le
feu pour nous. J'ai eu l'air de me ruiner, et Paz tient ma maison avec
un ordre et une économie si parfaits qu'il a réparé par là quelques
pertes inconsidérées au jeu, des sottises de jeune homme. Mon Thaddée
est rusé comme deux Génois, ardent au gain comme un juif polonais,
prévoyant comme une bonne ménagère. Jamais je n'ai pu le décider à vivre
comme moi quand j'étais garçon. Parfois, il a fallu les douces
violences de l'amitié pour l'emmener au spectacle quand j'y allais seul,
ou dans les dîners que je donnais au cabaret à de joyeuses compagnies.
Il n'aime pas la vie des salons.
--Qu'aime-t-il donc? demanda Clémentine.
--Il aime la Pologne, il la pleure. Ses seules dissipations ont été les
secours envoyés plus en mon nom qu'au sien à quelques-uns de nos pauvres
exilés.
--Tiens, mais je vais l'aimer, ce brave garçon, dit la comtesse, il me
paraît simple comme ce qui est vraiment grand.
--Toutes les belles choses que tu as trouvées ici, reprit Adam qui
trahissait la plus noble des sécurités en vantant son ami, Paz les a
dénichées, il les a eues aux ventes ou dans les occasions. Oh! il est
plus marchand que les marchands. Quand tu le verras se frottant les
mains dans la cour, dis-toi qu'il a troqué un bon cheval contre un
meilleur. Il vit par moi, son bonheur est de me voir élégant, dans un
équipage resplendissant. Les devoirs qu'il s'impose à lui-même, il les
accomplit sans bruit, sans emphase. Un soir, j'ai perdu vingt mille
francs au whist. Que dira Paz? me suis-je écrié en revenant. Paz me les
a remis, non sans lâcher un soupir; mais il ne m'a pas seulement blâmé
par un regard. Ce soupir m'a plus retenu que les remontrances des
oncles, des femmes ou des mères en pareil cas.--Tu les regrettes? lui
ai-je dit.--Oh! ni pour toi ni pour moi; non, j'ai seulement pensé que
vingt pauvres Paz vivraient de cela pendant une année. Tu comprends que
les Pazzi valent les Laginski. Aussi n'ai-je jamais voulu voir un
inférieur dans mon cher Paz. J'ai tâché d'être aussi grand dans mon
genre qu'il l'est dans le sien. Je ne suis jamais sorti de chez moi, ni
rentré, sans aller chez Paz comme j'irais chez mon père. Ma fortune est
la sienne. Enfin Thaddée est certain que je me précipiterais aujourd'hui
dans un danger pour l'en tirer, comme je l'ai fait deux fois.
--Ce n'est pas peu dire, mon ami, dit la comtesse. Le dévouement est un
éclair. On se dévoue à la guerre et l'on ne se dévoue plus à Paris.
--Eh bien! reprit Adam, pour Paz, je suis toujours à la guerre. Nos deux
caractères ont conservé leurs aspérités et leurs défauts, mais la
mutuelle connaissance de nos âmes a resserré les liens déjà si étroits
de notre amitié. On peut sauver la vie à un homme et le tuer après, si
nous trouvons en lui un mauvais compagnon; mais ce qui rend les amitiés
indissolubles, nous l'avons éprouvé. Chez nous, il y a cet échange
constant d'impressions heureuses de part et d'autre, qui peut-être fait
sous ce rapport l'amitié plus riche que l'amour.
Une jolie main ferma la bouche au comte si promptement que le geste
ressemblait à un soufflet.
--Mais oui, dit-il. L'amitié, mon ange, ignore les banqueroutes du
sentiment et les faillites du plaisir. Après avoir donné plus qu'il n'a,
l'amour finit par donner moins qu'il ne reçoit.
--D'un côté, comme de l'autre, dit en souriant Clémentine.
--Oui, reprit Adam; tandis que l'amitié ne peut que s'augmenter. Tu n'as
pas à faire la moue: nous sommes, mon ange, aussi amis qu'amants. Nous
avons, du moins, je l'espère, réuni les deux sentiments dans notre
heureux mariage.
--Je vais t'expliquer ce qui vous a rendus si bons amis, dit Clémentine.
La différence de vos deux existences vient de vos goûts et non d'un
choix obligé, de votre fantaisie et non de vos positions. Autant qu'on
peut juger un homme en l'entrevoyant, et d'après ce que tu me dis, ici
le subalterne peut devenir dans certains moments le supérieur.
--Oh! Paz m'est vraiment supérieur, répliqua naïvement Adam. Je n'ai
d'autre avantage sur lui que le hasard.
Sa femme l'embrassa pour la noblesse de cet aveu.
--L'excessive adresse avec laquelle il cache la grandeur de ses
sentiments est une immense supériorité, reprit le comte. Je lui ai
dit:--Tu es un sournois, tu as dans le coeur de vastes domaines où tu te
retires. Il a droit au titre de comte Paz, il ne se fait appeler à Paris
que le capitaine.
--Enfin, le Florentin du moyen âge a reparu à trois cents ans de
distance, dit la comtesse. Il y a du Dante et du Michel-Ange chez lui.
--Tiens, tu as raison, il est poëte par l'âme, répondit Adam.
--Me voilà donc mariée à deux Polonais, dit la jeune comtesse avec un
geste digne de Marie Dorval.
--Chère enfant! dit Adam en pressant Clémentine sur lui, tu m'aurais
fait bien du chagrin si mon ami ne t'avait pas plu: nous en avions peur
l'un et l'autre, quoiqu'il ait été ravi de mon mariage. Tu le rendras
très-heureux en lui disant que tu l'aimes... ah! comme un vieil ami.
--Je vais donc m'habiller, il fait beau, nous sortirons tous trois, dit
Clémentine en sonnant sa femme de chambre.
Paz menait une vie si souterraine que tout le Paris élégant se demanda
qui accompagnait Clémentine Laginska lorsqu'on la vit allant au bois de
Boulogne et en revenant entre Thaddée et son mari. Clémentine avait
exigé, pendant la promenade, que Thaddée dînât avec elle. Ce caprice de
souveraine absolue força le capitaine à faire une toilette insolite. Au
retour du bois, Clémentine se mit avec une certaine coquetterie, et de
manière à produire de l'impression sur Adam lui-même en entrant dans le
salon où les deux amis l'attendaient.
--Comte Paz, dit-elle, nous irons ensemble à l'Opéra.
Ce fut dit de ce ton qui, chez les femmes, signifie: Si vous me refusez,
nous nous brouillons.
--Volontiers, madame, répondit le capitaine. Mais comme je n'ai pas la
fortune d'un comte, appelez-moi simplement capitaine.
--Eh bien, capitaine, donnez-moi le bras, dit-elle en le lui prenant et
l'emmenant dans la salle à manger par un mouvement plein de cette
onctueuse familiarité qui ravit les amoureux.
La comtesse plaça près d'elle le capitaine, dont l'attitude fut celle
d'un sous-lieutenant pauvre dînant chez un riche général. Paz laissa
parler Clémentine, l'écouta tout en lui témoignant la déférence qu'on a
pour un supérieur, ne la contredit en rien et attendit une interrogation
formelle avant de répondre. Enfin il parut presque stupide à la
comtesse, dont les coquetteries échouèrent devant ce sérieux glacial et
ce respect diplomatique. En vain Adam lui disait:--Egaie-toi donc,
Thaddée! On penserait que tu n'es pas chez toi! Tu as sans doute fait la
gageure de déconcerter Clémentine? Thaddée resta lourd et endormi. Quand
les maîtres furent seuls à la fin du dessert, le capitaine expliqua
comment sa vie était arrangée au rebours de celle des gens du monde: il
se couchait à huit heures et se levait de grand matin; il mit ainsi sa
contenance sur une grande envie de dormir.
--Mon intention, en vous emmenant à l'Opéra, capitaine, était de vous
amuser; mais faites comme vous voudrez, dit Clémentine un peu piquée.
--J'irai, répondit Paz.
--Duprez chante Guillaume Tell, reprit Adam, mais peut-être aimerais-tu
mieux venir aux Variétés?
Le capitaine sourit et sonna; le valet de chambre vint:--Constantin, lui
dit-il, attellera la voiture au lieu d'atteler le coupé. Nous ne
tiendrions pas sans être gênés, ajouta-t-il en regardant le comte.
--Un Français aurait oublié cela, dit Clémentine en souriant.
--Ah! mais nous sommes des Florentins transplantés dans le Nord,
répondit Thaddée avec une finesse d'accent et avec un regard qui firent
voir dans sa conduite à table l'effet d'un parti pris.
Par une imprudence assez concevable, il y eut trop de contraste entre la
mise en scène involontaire de cette phrase et l'attitude de Paz pendant
le dîner. Clémentine examina le capitaine par une de ces oeillades
sournoises qui annoncent à la fois de l'étonnement et de l'observation
chez les femmes. Aussi, pendant le temps où tous trois ils prirent le
café au salon, régna-t-il un silence assez gênant pour Adam, incapable
d'en deviner le pourquoi. Clémentine n'agaçait plus Thaddée. De son côté
le capitaine reprit sa raideur militaire et ne la quitta plus, ni
pendant la route ni dans la loge où il feignit de dormir.
--Vous voyez, madame, que je suis un bien ennuyeux personnage, dit-il au
dernier acte de _Guillaume Tell_, pendant la danse. N'avais-je pas bien
raison de rester, comme on dit, dans ma spécialité?
--Ma foi, mon cher capitaine, vous n'êtes ni charlatan ni causeur, vous
êtes très-peu Polonais.
--Laissez-moi donc, reprit-il, veiller à vos plaisirs, à votre fortune
et à votre maison, je ne suis bon qu'à cela.
--Tartufe, va! dit en souriant le comte Adam. Ma chère, il est plein de
coeur, il est instruit; il pourrait, s'il voulait, tenir sa place dans
un salon. Clémentine, ne prends pas sa modestie au mot.
--Adieu, comtesse, j'ai fait preuve de complaisance, je me sers de votre
voiture pour aller dormir au plus tôt, et vais vous la renvoyer.
Clémentine fit une inclination de tête et le laissa partir sans rien
répondre.
--Quel ours! dit-elle au comte. Tu es bien plus gentil, toi!
Adam serra la main de sa femme sans qu'on pût le voir.
--Pauvre cher Thaddée, il s'est efforcé de se faire _repoussoir_ là où
bien des hommes auraient tâché de paraître plus aimables que moi.
--Oh! dit-elle, je ne sais pas s'il n'y a point de _calcul_ dans sa
conduite: il aurait intrigué une femme ordinaire.
Une demi-heure après, pendant que Boleslas le chasseur criait: La porte!
que le cocher, sa voiture tournée pour entrer, attendait que les deux
battants fussent ouverts, Clémentine dit au comte:--Où perche donc le
capitaine?
--Tiens, là! répondit Adam en montrant un petit étage en attique
élégamment élevé de chaque côté de la porte cochère et dont une fenêtre
donnait sur la rue. Son appartement s'étend au-dessus des remises.
--Et qui donc occupe l'autre côté?
--Personne encore, répondit Adam. L'autre petit appartement situé
au-dessus des écuries sera pour nos enfants et pour leur précepteur.
--Il n'est pas couché, dit la comtesse en apercevant de la lumière chez
Thaddée quand la voiture fut sous le portique à colonnes copiées sur
celles des Tuileries et qui remplaçait la vulgaire marquise de zinc
peint en coutil.
Le capitaine en robe de chambre, une pipe à la main, regardait
Clémentine entrant dans le vestibule. La journée avait été rude pour
lui. Voici pourquoi. Thaddée eut dans le coeur un terrible mouvement le
jour où, conduit par Adam aux Italiens pour la juger, il avait vu
mademoiselle du Rouvre; puis, quand il la revit à la mairie et à
Saint-Thomas-d'Aquin, il reconnut en elle cette femme que tout homme
doit aimer exclusivement, car don Juan lui-même en préférait une dans
les _mille e tre_! Aussi Paz conseilla-t-il fortement le voyage
classique après le mariage. Quasi tranquille pendant tout le temps que
dura l'absence de Clémentine, ses souffrances recommençaient depuis le
retour de ce joli ménage. Or, voici ce qu'il pensait en fumant du lataki
dans sa pipe de merisier longue de six pieds, un présent d'Adam:--Moi
seul et Dieu qui me récompensera d'avoir souffert en silence, nous
devons seuls savoir à quel point je l'aime! Mais comment n'avoir ni son
amour ni sa haine?
Et il réfléchissait à perte de vue sur ce théorème de stratégie
amoureuse. Il ne faut pas croire que Thaddée vécût sans plaisir au
milieu de sa douleur. Les sublimes tromperies de cette journée furent
des sources de joie intérieure. Depuis le retour de Clémentine et
d'Adam, il éprouvait de jour en jour des satisfactions ineffables en se
voyant nécessaire à ce ménage qui, sans son dévouement, eût marché
certainement à sa ruine. Quelle fortune résisterait aux prodigalités de
la vie parisienne? Élevée chez un père dissipateur, Clémentine ne savait
rien de la tenue d'une maison, qu'aujourd'hui les femmes les plus
riches, les plus nobles sont obligées de surveiller par elles-mêmes. Qui
maintenant peut avoir un intendant? Adam, de son côté, fils d'un de ces
grands seigneurs polonais qui se laissent dévorer par les juifs,
incapable d'administrer les débris d'une des plus immenses fortunes de
Pologne, où il y en a d'immenses, n'était pas d'un caractère à brider ni
ses fantaisies ni celles de sa femme. Seul il se fût ruiné peut-être
avant son mariage. Paz l'avait empêché de jouer à la Bourse, n'est-ce
pas déjà tout dire? Ainsi, en se sentant aimer malgré lui Clémentine,
Paz n'eut pas la ressource de quitter la maison et d'aller voyager pour
oublier sa passion. La reconnaissance, ce mot de l'énigme que présentait
sa vie, le clouait dans cet hôtel où lui seul pouvait être l'homme
d'affaires de cette famille insouciante. Le voyage d'Adam et de
Clémentine lui fit espérer du calme; mais la comtesse, revenue plus
belle, jouissant de cette liberté d'esprit que le mariage offre aux
Parisiennes, déployait toutes les grâces d'une jeune femme, et ce je ne
sais quoi d'attrayant qui vient du bonheur ou de l'indépendance que lui
donnait un jeune homme aussi confiant, aussi vraiment chevaleresque,
aussi amoureux qu'Adam. Avoir la certitude d'être la cheville ouvrière
de la splendeur de cette maison, voir Clémentine descendant de voiture
au retour d'une fête ou partant le matin pour le bois, la rencontrer sur
les boulevards dans sa jolie voiture, comme une fleur dans sa coque de
feuilles, inspirait au pauvre Thaddée des voluptés mystérieuses et
pleines qui s'épanouissaient au fond de son coeur, sans que jamais la
moindre trace en parût sur son visage. Comment, depuis cinq mois, la
comtesse eût-elle aperçu le capitaine? il se cachait d'elle en dérobant
le soin qu'il mettait à l'éviter. Rien ne ressemble plus à l'amour divin
que l'amour sans espoir. Un homme ne doit-il pas avoir une certaine
profondeur dans le coeur pour se dévouer dans le silence et dans
l'obscurité? Cette profondeur, où se tapit un orgueil de père et de
Dieu, contient le culte de l'amour pour l'amour, comme le pouvoir pour
le pouvoir fut le mot de la vie des jésuites, avarice sublime en ce
qu'elle est constamment généreuse et modelée enfin sur la mystérieuse
existence des principes du monde. L'_Effet_, n'est-ce pas la Nature? et
la Nature est enchanteresse, elle appartient à l'homme, au poëte, au
peintre, à l'amant; mais la _Cause_ n'est-elle pas, aux yeux de
quelques âmes privilégiées et pour certains penseurs gigantesques,
supérieure à la Nature? La Cause, c'est Dieu. Dans cette sphère des
causes vivent les Newton, les Laplace, les Kepler, les Descartes, les
Malebranche, les Spinosa, les Buffon, les vrais poètes et les solitaires
du second âge chrétien, les sainte Thérèse de l'Espagne et les sublimes
extatiques. Chaque sentiment humain comporte des analogies avec cette
situation où l'esprit abandonne l'Effet pour la Cause, et Thaddée avait
atteint à cette hauteur où tout change d'aspect. En proie à des joies de
créateur indicibles, Thaddée était en amour ce que nous connaissons de
plus grand dans les fastes du génie.
--Non, elle n'est pas entièrement trompée, se disait-il en suivant la
fumée de sa pipe. Elle pourrait me brouiller sans retour avec Adam si
elle me prenait en grippe; et si elle coquettait pour me tourmenter, que
deviendrais-je?
La fatuité de cette dernière supposition était si contraire au caractère
modeste et à l'espèce de timidité germanique du capitaine, qu'il se
gourmanda de l'avoir eue et se coucha résolu d'attendre les événements
avant de prendre un parti.
Le lendemain, Clémentine déjeuna très-bien sans Thaddée, et sans
s'apercevoir de son manque d'obéissance. Ce lendemain se trouva son jour
de réception, qui, chez elle, comportait une splendeur royale. Elle ne
fit pas attention à l'absence du capitaine sur qui roulaient les détails
de ces journées d'apparat.
--Bon! se dit-il en entendant les équipages s'en aller sur les deux
heures du matin, la comtesse n'a eu qu'une fantaisie ou une curiosité de
Parisienne.
Le capitaine reprit donc ses allures ordinaires pour un moment dérangées
par cet incident. Détournée par les préoccupations de la vie parisienne,
Clémentine parut avoir oublié Paz. Pense-t-on, en effet, que ce soit peu
de chose que de régner sur cet inconstant Paris? Croirait-on, par
hasard, qu'à ce jeu suprême on risque seulement sa fortune? Les hivers
sont pour les femmes à la mode ce que fut jadis une campagne pour les
militaires de l'empire. Quelle oeuvre d'art et de génie qu'une toilette
ou une coiffure destinées à faire sensation! Une femme frêle et délicate
garde son dur et brillant harnais de fleurs et de diamants, de soie et
d'acier, de neuf heures du soir à deux et souvent trois heures du matin.
Elle mange peu pour attirer le regard sur une taille fine; à la faim qui
la saisit pendant la soirée, elle oppose des tasses de thé
débilitantes, des gâteaux sucrés, des glaces échauffantes ou de lourdes
tranches de pâtisseries. L'estomac doit se plier aux ordres de la
coquetterie. Le réveil a lieu très-tard. Tout est alors en contradiction
avec les lois de la nature, et la nature est impitoyable. A peine levée,
une femme à la mode recommence une toilette du matin, pense à sa
toilette de l'après-midi. N'a-t-elle pas à recevoir, à faire des
visites, à aller au bois à cheval ou en voiture? Ne faut-il pas toujours
s'exercer au manège des sourires, se tendre l'esprit à forger des
compliments qui ne paraissent ni communs ni recherchés? Et toutes les
femmes n'y réussissent pas. Étonnez-vous donc, en voyant une jeune femme
que le monde a reçue fraîche, de la retrouver trois ans après flétrie et
passée. A peine six mois passés à la campagne guérissent-ils les plaies
faites par l'hiver? On n'entend aujourd'hui parler que de gastrites, de
maux étranges, inconnus d'ailleurs aux femmes occupées de leurs ménages.
Autrefois la femme se montrait quelquefois; aujourd'hui, elle est
toujours en scène. Clémentine avait à lutter: on commençait à la citer,
et dans les soins exigés par cette bataille entre elle et ses rivales, à
peine y avait-il place pour l'amour de son mari. Thaddée pouvait bien
être oublié.
Cependant un mois après, au mois de mai, quelques jours avant de partir
pour la terre de Ronquerolles, en Bourgogne, au retour du bois, elle
aperçut, dans la contre-allée des Champs-Élysées, Thaddée mis avec
recherche, s'extasiant à voir sa comtesse belle dans sa calèche, les
chevaux fringants, les livrées étincelantes, enfin son cher ménage
admiré.
--Voilà le capitaine, dit-elle à son mari.
--Comme il est heureux! répondit Adam. Voilà ses fêtes! Il n'y a pas
d'équipage mieux tenu que le nôtre, et il jouit de voir tout le monde
enviant notre bonheur. Ah! tu le remarques pour la première fois, mais
il est là presque tous les jours.
--A quoi peut-il penser? dit Clémentine.
--Il pense en ce moment que l'hiver a coûté bien cher et que nous allons
faire des économies chez ton vieil oncle Ronquerolles, répondit Adam.
La comtesse ordonna d'arrêter devant Paz et le fit asseoir à côté d'elle
dans la calèche. Thaddée devint rouge comme une cerise.
--Je vais vous empester, dit-il, je viens de fumer des cigares.
--Adam ne m'empeste-t-il pas! répondit-elle vivement.
--Oui, mais c'est Adam, répliqua le capitaine.
--Et pourquoi Thaddée n'aurait-il pas les mêmes priviléges? dit la
comtesse en souriant.
Ce divin sourire eut une force qui triompha des héroïques résolutions de
Paz; il regarda Clémentine avec tout le feu de son âme dans ses yeux,
mais tempéré par le témoignage angélique de sa reconnaissance, à lui,
homme qui ne vivait que par ce sentiment. La comtesse se croisa les bras
dans son châle, s'appuya pensive sur les coussins en y froissant les
plumes de son joli chapeau, et arrêta ses yeux sur les passants. Cet
éclair d'une âme grande et jusque-là résignée attaqua sa sensibilité.
Quel était après tout à ses yeux le mérite d'Adam? N'est-il pas naturel
d'avoir du courage et de la générosité? Mais le capitaine!..... Thaddée
possédait de plus qu'Adam ou paraissait posséder une immense
supériorité. Quelles funestes pensées saisirent la comtesse en observant
de nouveau le contraste de la belle nature si complète qui distinguait
Thaddée et de cette grêle nature qui, chez Adam, indiquait la
dégénérescence forcée des familles aristocratiques assez insensées pour
toujours s'allier entre elles? Ces pensées, le diable seul les connut;
car la jeune femme demeura les yeux penseurs mais vagues, sans rien dire
jusqu'à l'hôtel.
--Vous dînez avec nous, autrement je me fâcherais de ce que vous m'avez
désobéi, dit-elle en entrant. Vous êtes Thaddée pour moi comme pour
Adam. Je sais les obligations que vous lui avez, mais je sais aussi
toutes celles que nous vous avons. Pour deux mouvements de générosité,
qui sont si naturels, vous êtes généreux à toute heure et tous les
jours. Mon père vient dîner avec nous, ainsi que mon oncle Ronquerolles
et ma tante de Sérizy, habillez-vous, dit-elle en prenant la main qu'il
lui tendait pour l'aider à descendre de voiture.
Thaddée monta chez lui pour s'habiller, le coeur à la fois heureux et
comprimé par un tremblement horrible. Il descendit au dernier moment et
rejoua pendant le dîner son rôle de militaire, bon seulement à remplir
les fonctions d'un intendant. Mais cette fois Clémentine ne fut pas la
dupe de Paz, dont le regard l'avait éclairée. Ronquerolles,
l'ambassadeur le plus habile après le prince de Talleyrand et qui servit
si bien de Marsay pendant son court ministère, fut instruit par sa nièce
de la haute valeur du comte Paz, qui se faisait si modestement
l'intendant de son ami Mitgislas.
--Et comment est-ce la première fois que je vois le comte Paz? dit le
marquis de Ronquerolles.
--Eh! il est sournois et cachottier, répondit Clémentine en lançant un
regard à Paz pour lui dire de changer sa manière d'être.
Hélas! il faut l'avouer, au risque de rendre le capitaine moins
intéressant, Paz, quoique supérieur à son ami Adam, n'était pas un homme
fort. Sa supériorité apparente, il la devait au malheur. Dans ses jours
de misère et d'isolement, à Varsovie, il lisait, il s'instruisait, il
comparait et méditait; mais le don de création qui fait le grand homme,
il ne le possédait point, et peut-il jamais s'acquérir? Paz, uniquement
grand par le coeur, allait alors au sublime; mais dans la sphère des
sentiments, plus homme d'action que de pensées, il gardait sa pensée
pour lui. Sa pensée ne servait alors qu'à lui ronger le coeur. Et
qu'est-ce d'ailleurs qu'une pensée inexprimée!
Sur le mot de Clémentine, le marquis de Ronquerolles et sa soeur
échangèrent un singulier regard en se montrant leur nièce, le comte Adam
et Paz. Ce fut une de ces scènes rapides qui n'ont lieu qu'en Italie et
à Paris. Dans ces deux endroits du monde, toutes les cours exceptées,
les yeux savent dire autant de choses. Pour communiquer à l'oeil toute
la puissance de l'âme, lui donner la valeur d'un discours, y mettre un
poème ou un drame d'un seul coup, il faut ou l'excessive servitude ou
l'excessive liberté. Adam, le marquis de Rouvre et la comtesse
n'aperçurent point cette lumineuse observation d'une vieille coquette et
d'un vieux diplomate: mais Paz, ce chien fidèle, en comprit les
prophéties. Ce fut, remarquez-le, l'affaire de deux secondes. Vouloir
peindre l'ouragan qui ravagea l'âme du capitaine, ce serait être trop
diffus par le temps qui court.
--Quoi! déjà la tante et l'oncle croient que je puis être aimé.
Maintenant mon bonheur ne dépend plus que de mon audace? Et Adam!...
L'Amour idéal et le Désir, tous deux aussi puissants que la
Reconnaissance et l'Amitié, s'entre-choquèrent, et l'Amour l'emporta
pour un moment. Ce pauvre admirable amant voulut avoir sa journée! Paz
devint spirituel, il voulut plaire, et raconta l'insurrection polonaise
à grands traits sur une explication demandée par le diplomate. Paz vit
alors, au dessert, Clémentine suspendue à ses lèvres, le prenant pour un
héros, et oubliant qu'Adam, après avoir sacrifié le tiers de son
immense fortune, avait encouru les chances de l'exil. A neuf heures, le
café pris, madame de Sérizy baisa sa nièce au front en lui serrant la
main, et emmena d'autorité le comte Adam en laissant les marquis du
Rouvre et de Ronquerolles, qui, dix minutes après, s'en allèrent. Paz et
Clémentine restèrent seuls.
--Je vais vous laisser, madame, dit Thaddée, car vous les rejoindrez à
l'Opéra.
--Non, répondit-elle, la danse ne me plaît pas; et l'on donne ce soir un
ballet détestable, la _Révolte au Sérail_.
Un moment de silence.
--Il y a deux ans, Adam n'y serait pas allé sans moi! reprit-elle sans
regarder Paz.
--Il vous aime à la folie... répondit Thaddée.
--Eh! c'est parce qu'il m'aime à la folie qu'il ne m'aimera peut-être
plus demain, s'écria la comtesse.
--Les Parisiennes sont inexplicables, dit Thaddée. Quand elles sont
aimées _à la folie_, elles veulent être aimées _raisonnablement_; et
quand on les aime _raisonnablement_, elles vous reprochent de ne pas
savoir aimer.
--Et elles ont toujours raison, Thaddée, reprit-elle en souriant. Je
connais bien Adam, je ne lui en veux point: il est léger et surtout
grand seigneur, il sera toujours content de m'avoir pour sa femme et ne
me contrariera jamais dans aucun de mes goûts; mais...
--Quel est le mariage où il n'y a pas de _mais_? dit tout doucement
Thaddée en tâchant de donner un autre cours aux pensées de la comtesse.
L'homme le moins avantageux aurait eu peut-être la pensée qui faillit
rendre cet amoureux fou et que voici:--Si je ne lui dis pas que je
l'aime, je suis un imbécile! se dit le capitaine.
Il régnait entre eux un de ces terribles silences qui crèvent de
pensées. La comtesse examinait Paz en dessous, de même que Paz la
contemplait dans la glace. En s'enfonçant dans sa bergère en homme repu
qui digère, un vrai geste de mari ou de vieillard indifférent, Paz
croisa ses mains sur son ventre, fit passer rapidement et machinalement
ses pouces l'un sur l'autre, et regarda le feu bêtement.
--Mais dites-moi donc du bien d'Adam!... s'écria Clémentine. Dites-moi
que ce n'est pas un homme léger, vous qui le connaissez!
Ce cri fut sublime.
--Voici donc le moment venu d'élever entre nous des barrières
insurmontables, pensa le pauvre Paz en concevant un héroïque mensonge.
--Du bien?... reprit-il, je l'aime trop, vous ne me croiriez point. Je
suis incapable de vous en dire du mal. Ainsi... mon rôle, madame, est
bien difficile entre vous deux.
Clémentine baissa la tête et regarda le bout des souliers vernis de Paz.
--Vous autres gens du Nord, vous n'avez que le courage physique, vous
manquez de constance dans vos décisions, dit-elle en murmurant.
--Qu'allez-vous faire seule, madame? répondit Paz en prenant un air
d'ingénuité parfait.
--Vous ne me tenez donc pas compagnie?
--Pardonnez-moi de vous quitter...
--Comment! où allez-vous?
--Je vais au Cirque, il ouvre aux Champs-Élysées ce soir, et je ne puis
y manquer...
--Et pourquoi? dit Clémentine en l'interrogeant par un regard à demi
colère.
--Faut-il vous ouvrir mon coeur, reprit-il en rougissant, vous confier
ce que je cache à mon cher Adam, qui croit que je n'aime que la Pologne.
--Ah! un secret chez notre noble capitaine?
--Une infamie que vous comprendrez et de laquelle vous me consolerez.
--Vous, infâme?...
--Oui, moi, comte Paz, je suis amoureux fou d'une fille qui courait la
France avec la famille Bouthor, des gens qui ont un cirque à l'instar de
celui de Franconi, mais qui n'exploitent que les foires! Je l'ai fait
engager par le directeur du Cirque-Olympique.
--Elle est belle? dit la comtesse.
--Pour moi, reprit-il mélancoliquement. Malaga, tel est son nom de
guerre, est forte, agile et souple. Pourquoi je la préfère _à toutes les
femmes du monde_?... en vérité! je ne saurais le dire. Quand je la vois,
ses cheveux noirs retenus par un bandeau de satin bleu flottant sur ses
épaules olivâtres et nues, vêtue d'une tunique blanche à bordure dorée
et d'un maillot en tricot de soie qui en fait une statue grecque
vivante, les pieds dans des chaussons de satin éraillé, passant des
drapeaux à la main, aux sons d'une musique militaire, à travers un
immense cerceau dont le papier se déchire en l'air, quand le cheval fuit
au grand galop, et qu'elle retombe avec grâce sur lui, applaudie, sans
claqueurs, par tout un peuple... eh bien! ça m'émeut?
--Plus qu'une belle femme au bal?... dit Clémentine avec une surprise
provoquante.
--Oui, répondit Paz d'une voix étranglée. Cette admirable agilité, cette
grâce constante dans un constant péril me paraissent le plus beau
triomphe d'une femme... Oui, madame, Rachel et la Dorval, la Cinti et la
Malibran, la Grisi et la Taglioni, la Pasta et l'Essler, tout ce qui
règne ou régna sur les planches ne me semble pas digne de délier les
cothurnes de Malaga qui sait descendre et remonter sur un cheval au
grandissime galop, qui se glisse dessous à gauche pour remonter à
droite, qui voltige comme un feu follet blanc autour de l'animal le plus
fougueux, qui peut se tenir sur la pointe d'un seul pied et tomber
assise les pieds pendants sur le dos de ce cheval toujours au galop, et
qui, enfin, debout sur le coursier sans bride, tricote des bas, casse
des oeufs ou fricasse une omelette à la profonde admiration du peuple,
du vrai peuple, les paysans et les soldats! A la parade, jadis cette
délicieuse Colombine portait des chaises sur le bout de son nez, le plus
joli nez grec que j'aie vu. Malaga, madame, est l'adresse en personne.
D'une force herculéenne, elle n'a besoin que de son poing mignon ou de
son petit pied pour se débarrasser de trois ou quatre hommes. C'est
enfin la déesse de la gymnastique.
--Elle doit être stupide....
--Oh! reprit Paz, amusante comme l'héroïne de _Péveril du Pic_!
Insouciante comme un Bohême, elle dit tout ce qui lui passe par la tête,
elle se soucie de l'avenir comme vous pouvez vous soucier des sous que
vous jetez à un pauvre, et il lui échappe des choses sublimes. Jamais on
ne lui prouvera qu'un vieux diplomate soit un beau jeune homme, et un
million ne la ferait pas changer d'avis. Son amour est pour un homme une
flatterie perpétuelle. D'une santé vraiment insolente, ses dents sont
trente-deux perles d'un orient délicieux et enchâssées dans un corail.
Son mufle, elle appelle ainsi le bas de sa figure, a, selon
l'expression de Shakspeare, la verdeur, la saveur d'un museau de
génisse. Et ça donne de cruels chagrins! Elle estime de beaux hommes,
des hommes forts, des Adolphe, des Auguste, des Alexandre, des bateleurs
et des paillasses. Son instructeur, un affreux Cassandre, la rouait de
coups, et il en a fallu des milliers pour lui donner sa souplesse, sa
grâce, son intrépidité.
--Vous êtes ivre de Malaga! dit la comtesse.
--Elle ne se nomme Malaga que sur l'affiche, dit Paz d'un air piqué.
Elle demeure rue Saint-Lazare, dans un petit appartement au troisième,
dans le velours et la soie, et vit là comme une princesse. Elle a deux
existences, sa vie foraine et sa vie de jolie femme.
--Et vous aime-t-elle?
--Elle m'aime... vous allez rire... uniquement parce que je suis
Polonais! Elle voit toujours les Polonais d'après la gravure de
Poniatowski sautant dans l'Elster, car pour toute la France l'Elster, où
il est impossible de se noyer, est un fleuve impétueux qui a englouti
Poniatowski... Au milieu de tout cela, je suis bien malheureux,
madame...
Une larme de rage qui coula dans les yeux de Thaddée émut Clémentine.
--Vous aimez l'extraordinaire, vous autres hommes!
--Et vous donc? fit Thaddée.
--Je connais si bien Adam que je suis sûre qu'il m'oublierait pour
quelque faiseuse de tours comme votre Malaga. Mais où l'avez-vous vue?
--A Saint-Cloud, au mois de septembre dernier, le jour de la fête. Elle
était dans le coin de l'échafaud couvert de toiles où se font les
parades. Ses camarades, tous en costumes polonais, donnaient un
effroyable charivari. Je l'ai aperçue muette, silencieuse, et j'ai cru
deviner des pensées de mélancolie chez elle. N'y avait-il pas de quoi
pour une fille de vingt ans? Voilà ce qui m'a touché.
La comtesse était dans une pose délicieuse, pensive, quasi triste.
--Pauvre, pauvre Thaddée! s'écria-t-elle. Et avec la bonhomie de la
véritable grande dame, elle ajouta non sans un sourire fin:--Allez,
allez au Cirque!
Thaddée lui prit la main, la lui baisa en y laissant une larme chaude,
et sortit. Après avoir inventé sa passion pour une écuyère, il devait
lui donner quelque réalité. Dans son récit, il n'y avait de vrai que le
moment d'attention obtenu par l'illustre Malaga, l'écuyère de la famille
Bouthor, à Saint-Cloud, et dont le nom venait de frapper ses yeux le
matin dans l'affiche du Cirque. Le paillasse, gagné par une seule pièce
de cent sous, avait dit à Paz que l'écuyère était un enfant trouvé, volé
peut-être. Thaddée alla donc au Cirque et revit la belle écuyère.
Moyennant dix francs, un palefrenier, qui là remplace les habilleuses du
théâtre, lui apprit que Malaga se nommait Marguerite Turquet, et
demeurait rue des Fossés-du-Temple, à un cinquième étage.
Le lendemain, la mort dans l'âme, Paz se rendit au faubourg du Temple et
demanda mademoiselle Turquet, pendant l'été la doublure de la plus
illustre écuyère du Cirque, et comparse au théâtre pendant l'hiver.
--Malaga! cria la portière en se précipitant dans la mansarde, un beau
monsieur pour vous! il prend des renseignements auprès de Chapuzot qui
le fait droguer pour me donner le temps de t'avertir.
--Merci, mame Chapuzot; mais que pensera-t-il en me voyant repasser ma
robe?
--Ah bah! quand on aime, on aime tout de son objet.
--Est-ce un Anglais? ils aiment les chevaux!
--Non, il me fait l'effet d'être un Espagnol.
--Tant pis! on dit les Espagnols dans la débine... Restez donc avec moi,
mame Chapuzot, je n'aurai pas l'air d'une abandonnée...
--Que demandez-vous, monsieur? dit à Thaddée la portière en ouvrant la
porte.
--Mademoiselle Turquet.
--Ma fille, répondit la portière en se drapant, voici quelqu'un qui vous
réclame.
Une corde sur laquelle séchait du linge décoiffa le capitaine.
--Que désirez-vous, monsieur? dit Malaga en ramassant le chapeau de
Paz...
--Je vous ai vue au Cirque, vous m'avez rappelé une fille que j'ai
perdue, mademoiselle; et par attachement pour mon Héloïse à qui vous
ressemblez d'une manière frappante, je veux vous faire du bien, si
toutefois vous le permettez.
--Comment donc! mais asseyez-vous donc, général, dit madame Chapuzot. On
n'est pas plus honnête... ni plus galant.
--Je ne suis pas un galant, ma chère dame, fit Paz, je suis un père au
désespoir qui veut se tromper par une ressemblance.
--Ainsi je passerai pour votre fille? dit Malaga très-finement et sans
soupçonner la profonde véracité de cette proposition.
--Oui, dit Paz, je viendrai vous voir quelquefois, et pour que
l'illusion soit complète, je vous logerai dans un bel appartement,
richement meublé...
--J'aurai des meubles? dit Malaga en regardant la Chapuzot.
--Et des domestiques, reprit Paz, et toutes vos aises.
Malaga regarda l'étranger en dessous.
--De quel pays est monsieur?
--Je suis Polonais.
--J'accepte alors, dit-elle.
Paz sortit en promettant de revenir.
--En voilà une sévère! dit Marguerite Turquet en regardant madame
Chapuzot. Mais j'ai peur que cet homme ne veuille m'amadouer pour
réaliser quelque fantaisie. Bah! je me risque.
Un mois après cette bizarre entrevue, la belle écuyère habitait un
appartement délicieusement meublé par le tapissier du comte Adam, car
Paz voulut faire causer de sa folie à l'hôtel Laginski. Malaga, pour qui
cette aventure fut un rêve des Mille et une Nuits, était servie par le
ménage Chapuzot, à la fois ses confidents et ses domestiques. Les
Chapuzot et Marguerite Turquet attendaient un dénouement quelconque;
mais après un trimestre, ni Malaga ni la Chapuzot ne surent comment
expliquer le caprice du comte polonais. Paz venait passer une heure à
peu près par semaine, pendant laquelle il restait dans le salon sans
vouloir jamais aller ni dans le boudoir de Malaga, ni dans sa chambre,
où jamais il n'entra, malgré les plus habiles manoeuvres de l'écuyère et
des Chapuzot. Le comte s'informait des petits événements qui nuançaient
la vie de la baladine, et chaque fois il laissait deux pièces de
quarante francs sur la cheminée.
--Il a l'air bien ennuyé, disait madame Chapuzot.
--Oui, répondait Malaga, cet homme est froid comme verglas...
--Mais il est bon enfant tout de même, s'écriait Chapuzot heureux de se
voir habillé tout en drap bleu d'Elbeuf, et semblable à quelque garçon
de bureau d'un ministère.
Par son offrande périodique, Paz constituait à Marguerite Turquet une
rente de trois cent vingt francs par mois. Cette somme, jointe à ses
maigres appointements du Cirque, lui fit une existence splendide en
comparaison de sa misère passée. Il se répéta d'étranges récits au
Cirque entre les artistes sur le bonheur de Malaga. La vanité de
l'écuyère laissa porter à soixante mille francs les six mille francs que
son appartement coûtait au prudent capitaine. Au dire des clowns et des
comparses, Malaga mangeait dans l'argent. Elle venait d'ailleurs au
Cirque avec de charmants burnous, des cachemires, de délicieuses
écharpes. Enfin, le Polonais était la meilleure pâte d'homme qu'une
écuyère pût rencontrer: point tracassier, point jaloux, laissant à
Malaga toute sa liberté.
--Il y a des femmes qui sont bien heureuses! disait la rivale de Malaga.
Ce n'est pas à moi, qui sais faire _le grand écart_, à qui pareille
chose arriverait.
Malaga portait de jolis bibis, _faisait parfois sa tête_ (admirable
expression populaire) en voiture, au bois de Boulogne, où la jeunesse
élégante commençait à la remarquer. Enfin, on commençait à parler de
Malaga dans le monde interlope des femmes équivoques, et l'on y
attaquait son bonheur par des calomnies. On la disait somnambule, et le
Polonais passait pour un magnétiseur qui cherchait la pierre
philosophale. Quelques propos beaucoup plus envenimés que celui-là
rendirent Malaga plus curieuse que Psyché; elle les rapporta tout en
pleurant à Paz.
--Quand j'en veux à une femme, dit-elle en terminant, je ne la calomnie
pas, je ne prétends pas qu'on _la magnétise_ pour y trouver des pierres;
je dis qu'elle est bossue, et je le prouve. Pourquoi me
compromettez-vous?
Paz garda le plus cruel silence. La Chapuzot finit par savoir le nom et
le titre de Thaddée; elle apprit à l'hôtel Laginski des choses
positives: Paz était garçon, on ne lui connaissait de fille morte ni en
Pologne ni en France. Malaga ne put alors se défendre d'un sentiment de
terreur.
--Mon enfant, dit la Chapuzot, ce monstre-là...
Un homme qui se contentait de regarder d'une façon sournoise--en
dessous,--sans oser se prononcer sur rien,--sans avoir de
confiance,--une belle créature comme Malaga, dans les idées de la
Chapuzot, devait être un monstre.
--Ce monstre-là vous apprivoise pour vous amener à quelque chose
d'illégal, de criminel!... Dieu de Dieu, si vous alliez à la cour
d'assises, ou, ce qui me fait frémir de la tête aux pieds, que j'en
tremble rien que d'en parler, à la correctionnelle!... qu'on vous met
dans les journaux.... Moi, savez-vous à votre place ce que je ferais? Eh
bien! _n'_à votre place, je préviendrais, pour ma sûreté, la police.
Par un jour où les plus folles idées fermentèrent dans l'esprit de
Malaga, quand Paz mit ses pièces d'or sur le velours de la cheminée,
elle prit l'or et lui jeta au nez en lui disant:--Je ne veux pas
d'argent volé.
Le capitaine donna l'or aux Chapuzot et ne revint plus. Clémentine
passait alors la belle saison à la terre de son oncle, le marquis de
Ronquerolles, en Bourgogne. Quand la troupe du Cirque ne vit plus
Thaddée à sa place, il se fit une rumeur parmi les artistes. La grandeur
d'âme de Malaga fut traitée de bêtise par les uns, de finesse par les
autres. La conduite du Polonais, expliquée aux femmes les plus habiles,
parut inexplicable. Thaddée reçut dans une seule semaine trente-sept
lettres de femmes légères. Heureusement pour lui, son étonnante réserve
n'alluma pas d'autres curiosités et resta l'objet des causeries du monde
interlope.
Deux mois après, la belle écuyère, criblée de dettes, écrivit au comte
Paz cette lettre que les dandies ont regardée dans le temps comme un
chef-d'oeuvre:
  «Vous, que j'ose encore appeler mon ami, aurez-vous pitié de moi après
  ce qui s'est passé et que vous avez si mal interprété? Tout ce qui a
  pu vous blesser, mon coeur le désavoue. Si j'ai été assez heureuse
  pour que vous trouviez du charme à rester auprès de moi comme vous
  faisiez, revenez.... autrement, je tomberai dans le désespoir. La
  misère est déjà venue, et vous ne savez pas tout ce qu'elle amène de
  _choses bêtes_. Hier, j'ai vécu avec un hareng de deux sous et un sou
  de pain. Est-ce là le déjeuner de votre amante? Je n'ai plus les
  Chapuzot, qui paraissaient m'être si dévoués! Votre absence a eu pour
  effet de me faire voir le fond des attachements humains... Un chien
  qu'on a nourri ne nous quitte plus! Un huissier qui a fait le sourd, a
  tout saisi au nom du propriétaire, qui n'a pas de coeur, et du
  bijoutier, qui ne veut pas attendre seulement dix jours; car, avec
  votre confiance à vous autres, le crédit s'en va! Quelle position pour
  des femmes qui n'ont que de la joie à se reprocher! Mon ami, j'ai
  porté _chez ma tante_ tout ce qui avait de la valeur; je n'ai plus
  rien que votre souvenir, et voilà la mauvaise saison qui arrive.
  Pendant l'hiver je suis sans feux, puisqu'on ne joue que des
  mimodrames au boulevard, où je n'ai presque rien à faire que des bouts
  de rôle qui ne _posent_ pas une femme. Comment avez-vous pu vous
  méprendre à la noblesse de mes sentiments envers vous, car enfin nous
  n'avons pas deux manières d'exprimer notre reconnaissance? Vous qui
  paraissiez si joyeux de mon bien-être, comment m'avez-vous pu laisser
  dans la peine? O! mon seul ami sur terre, avant d'aller recommencer à
  courir les foires avec le cirque Bouthor, car je gagnerai au moins ma
  vie ainsi, pardonnez-moi d'avoir voulu savoir si je vous ai perdu pour
  toujours. Si je venais à penser à vous au moment où je saute dans le
  cercle, je suis capable de me casser les jambes en perdant un _temps_!
  Quoi qu'il en soit, vous avez à vous pour la vie
  »MARGUERITE TURQUET.»
--Cette lettre-là, se dit Thaddée en éclatant de rire, vaut mes dix
mille francs!
Clémentine arriva le lendemain, et, le lendemain, Paz la revit plus
belle, plus gracieuse que jamais. Après le dîner, pendant lequel la
comtesse eut un air de parfaite indifférence pour Thaddée, il se passa
dans le salon, après le départ du capitaine, une scène entre le comte et
sa femme. En ayant l'air de demander conseil à Adam, Thaddée lui avait
laissé, comme par mégarde, la lettre de Malaga.
--Pauvre Thaddée! dit Adam à sa femme après avoir vu Paz s'esquivant.
Quel malheur pour un homme si distingué d'être le jouet d'une baladine
du dernier ordre! Il y perdra tout, il s'avilira, il ne sera plus
reconnaissable dans quelque temps. Tenez, ma chère, lisez, dit le comte
en tendant à sa femme la lettre de Malaga.
Clémentine lut la lettre, qui sentait le tabac, et la jeta par un geste
de dégoût.
--Quelque épais que soit le bandeau qu'il a sur les yeux, il se sera
sans doute aperçu de quelque chose, dit Adam. Malaga lui aura fait des
traits.
--Et il y retourne! dit Clémentine, et il pardonnera! Ce n'est que pour
ces horribles femmes-là que vous avez de l'indulgence!
--Elles en ont tant besoin! dit Adam.
--Thaddée se rendait justice... en restant chez lui, reprit-elle.
--Oh! mon ange, vous allez bien loin, dit le comte qui d'abord enchanté
de rabaisser son ami aux yeux de sa femme ne voulait pas la mort du
pécheur.
Thaddée, qui connaissait bien Adam, lui avait demandé le plus profond
secret: il avait parlé pour faire excuser ses dissipations et prier son
ami de lui laisser prendre un millier d'écus pour Malaga.
--C'est un homme qui a un fier caractère, reprit Adam.
--Comment cela?
--Mais ne pas avoir dépensé plus de dix mille francs pour elle, et se
faire relancer par une pareille lettre avant de lui porter de quoi payer
ses dettes! Pour un Polonais, ma foi!...
--Mais il peut te ruiner, dit Clémentine avec le ton aigre de la
Parisienne quand elle exprime sa défiance de chatte.
--Oh! Je le connais, répondit Adam, il nous sacrifierait Malaga.
--Nous verrons, reprit la comtesse.
--S'il le fallait pour son bonheur, je n'hésiterais pas à lui demander
de la quitter. Constantin m'a dit que pendant le temps de leur liaison,
Paz, jusqu'alors si sobre, est quelquefois rentré très-étourdi... s'il
se laissait entraîner dans l'ivresse, je serais aussi chagrin que s'il
s'agissait de mon enfant.
--Ne m'en dites pas davantage, s'écria la comtesse en faisant un autre
geste de dégoût.
Deux jours après, le capitaine aperçut dans les manières, dans le son de
voix, dans les yeux de la comtesse, les terribles effets de
l'indiscrétion d'Adam. Le mépris avait creusé ses abîmes entre cette
charmante femme et lui. Aussi tomba-t-il dès lors dans une profonde
mélancolie, rongé par cette pensée: Tu t'es rendu toi-même indigne
d'elle! La vie lui devint pesante, le plus beau soleil fut grisâtre à
ses yeux. Néanmoins, il trouva sous ces flots de douleurs amères des
moments de joie: il put alors se livrer sans danger à son admiration
pour la comtesse, qui ne fit plus la moindre attention à lui quand, dans
les fêtes, tapi dans un coin, muet, mais tout yeux et tout coeur, il ne
perdait pas une de ses poses, pas un de ses chants quand elle chantait.
Il vivait enfin de cette belle vie, il pouvait panser lui-même le cheval
qu'_elle_ allait monter, se dévouer à l'économie de cette splendide
maison, pour les intérêts de laquelle il redoubla de dévouement. Ces
plaisirs silencieux furent ensevelis dans son coeur comme ceux de la
mère dont l'enfant ne sait jamais rien du coeur de sa mère; car est-ce
le savoir que d'en ignorer quelque chose? N'était-ce pas plus beau que
le chaste amour de Pétrarque pour Laure, qui se soldait en définitive
par un trésor de gloire et par le triomphe de la poésie qu'elle avait
inspirée? La sensation de d'Assas mourant n'est-elle pas toute une vie?
Cette sensation, Paz l'éprouva chaque jour sans mourir, mais aussi sans
le loyer de l'immortalité. Qu'y a-t-il donc dans l'amour pour que,
nonobstant ces délices secrètes, Paz fût dévoré de chagrins? La religion
catholique a tellement grandi l'amour, qu'elle y a marié pour ainsi dire
indissolublement l'estime et la noblesse. L'amour ne va pas sans les
supériorités dont s'enorgueillit l'homme, et il est tellement rare
d'être aimé quand on est méprisé, que Thaddée mourait des plaies qu'il
s'était volontairement faites. S'entendre dire qu'elle l'aurait aimé et
mourir?... le pauvre amoureux eût trouvé sa vie assez payée. Les
angoisses de sa situation antérieure lui semblaient préférables à vivre
près d'elle, en l'accablant de ses générosités sans être apprécié,
compris. Enfin, il voulait le loyer de sa vertu! Il maigrit et jaunit,
il tomba si bien malade, dévoré par une petite fièvre, que, pendant le
mois de janvier il fut obligé de rester au lit sans vouloir consulter de
médecin. Le comte Adam conçut de vives inquiétudes sur son pauvre
Thaddée. La comtesse eut alors la cruauté de dire en petit
comité:--Laissez-le donc, ne voyez-vous pas qu'il a quelque remords
olympique? Ce mot rendit à Thaddée le courage du désespoir, il se leva,
sortit, essaya de quelques distractions et recouvra la santé. Vers le
mois de février, Adam fit une perte assez considérable au Jockey-Club,
et comme il craignait sa femme, il vint prier Thaddée de mettre cette
somme sur le compte de ses dissipations avec Malaga.
--Qu'y a-t-il d'extraordinaire à ce que cette baladine t'ait coûté vingt
mille francs? Ça ne regarde que moi: tandis que si la comtesse savait
que je les ai perdus au jeu, je baisserais dans son estime; elle aurait
des craintes pour l'avenir.
--Encore cela, donc! s'écria Thaddée en laissant échapper un profond
soupir.
--Ah! Thaddée, ce service-là nous acquitterait quand je ne serais pas
déjà ton redevable.
--Adam, tu auras des enfants, ne joue plus, dit le capitaine.
--Malaga _nous_ coûte encore vingt mille francs! s'écria la comtesse
quelques jours après en apprenant la _générosité_ d'Adam envers Paz.
Dix mille auparavant, en tout trente mille! quinze cents francs de
rente, le prix de ma loge aux Italiens, la fortune de bien des
bourgeois... Oh! vous autres Polonais, disait-elle en cueillant des
fleurs dans sa belle serre, vous êtes incroyables. Tu n'es pas plus
furieux que ça?
--Ce pauvre Paz...
--Ce pauvre Paz, pauvre Paz, reprit-elle en interrompant, à quoi nous
est-il bon? Je vais me mettre à la tête de la maison, moi! Tu lui
donneras les cent louis de rentes qu'il a refusés, et il s'arrangera
comme il l'entend avec le Cirque-Olympique.
--Il nous est bien utile, il nous a certes économisé plus de quarante
mille francs depuis un an. Enfin, cher ange, il nous a placé cent mille
francs chez Rothschild, et un intendant nous les aurait volés...
Clémentine se radoucit, mais elle n'en fut pas moins dure pour Thaddée.
Quelques jours après, elle pria Paz de venir dans ce boudoir où un an
auparavant elle avait été surprise en le comparant au comte; cette fois,
elle le reçut en tête-à-tête sans y apercevoir le moindre danger.
--Mon cher Paz, lui dit-elle avec la familiarité sans conséquence des
grands envers leurs inférieurs, si vous aimez Adam comme vous le dites,
vous ferez une chose qu'il ne vous demandera jamais, mais que moi, sa
femme, je n'hésite pas à exiger de vous...
--Il s'agit de Malaga, dit Thaddée avec une profonde ironie.
--Eh bien! oui, dit-elle, si vous voulez finir vos jours avec nous, si
vous voulez que nous restions bons amis, quittez-la. Comment un vieux
soldat...
--Je n'ai que trente-cinq ans, et pas un cheveu blanc!
--Vous avez l'air d'en avoir, dit-elle, c'est la même chose. Comment un
homme aussi bon calculateur, aussi distingué...
Il y eut cela d'horrible que ce mot fut dit par elle avec une intention
évidente de réveiller en lui la noblesse d'âme qu'elle croyait éteinte.
--Aussi distingué que vous l'êtes, reprit-elle après une pause
imperceptible que lui fit faire un geste de Paz, se laisse attraper
comme un enfant! Votre aventure a rendu Malaga célèbre... Eh! bien, mon
oncle a voulu la voir, et il l'a vue. Mon oncle n'est pas le seul,
Malaga reçoit très-bien tous ces messieurs... Je vous ai cru l'âme
noble... Fi donc! Voyons, sera-ce une si grande perte pour vous qu'elle
ne puisse se réparer?
--Madame, si je connaissais un sacrifice à faire pour regagner votre
estime, il serait bientôt accompli; mais quitter Malaga n'en est pas
un...
--Dans votre position, voilà ce que je dirais si j'étais homme, répondit
Clémentine. Eh bien! si je prends cela pour un grand sacrifice, il n'y a
pas de quoi se fâcher.
Paz sortit en craignant de commettre quelque sottise, il se sentait
gagner par des idées folles. Il alla se promener au grand air,
légèrement vêtu malgré le froid, sans pouvoir éteindre les feux de sa
face et de son front.
--Je vous ai cru l'âme noble! Ces mots, il les entendait toujours.--Et
il y a bientôt un an, se disait-il, j'avais à moi seul battu les Russes!
Il pensait à laisser l'hôtel Laginski, à demander du service dans les
spahis et à se faire tuer en Afrique; mais il fut arrêté par une
horrible crainte.--Sans moi, que deviendront-ils? on les ruinerait
bientôt. Pauvre comtesse! quelle horrible vie pour elle que d'être
seulement réduite à trente mille livres de rentes! Allons, se dit-il,
puisqu'elle est perdue pour moi, du courage, et achevons mon ouvrage.
Chacun sait que depuis 1830 le carnaval a pris à Paris un développement
prodigieux qui le rend européen et bien autrement burlesque, bien
autrement animé que le feu carnaval de Venise. Est-ce que, les fortunes
diminuant outre mesure, les Parisiens auraient inventé de s'amuser
collectivement, comme avec leurs clubs ils font des salons sans
maîtresses de maison, sans politesse et à bon marché? Quoi qu'il en
soit, le mois de mars prodiguait alors ces bals où la danse, la farce,
la grosse joie, le délire, les images grotesques et les railleries
aiguisées par l'esprit parisien arrivent à des effets gigantesques.
Cette folie avait alors, rue Saint-Honoré, son Pandémonium, et dans
Musard son Napoléon, un petit homme fait exprès pour commander une
musique aussi puissante que la foule en désordre, et pour conduire le
galop, cette ronde du sabbat, une des gloires d'Auber, car le galop n'a
eu sa forme et sa poésie que depuis le grand galop de _Gustave_. Cet
immense final ne pourrait-il pas servir de symbole à une époque où,
depuis cinquante ans, tout défile avec la rapidité d'un rêve? Or, le
grave Thaddée, qui portait une divine image immaculée dans son coeur,
alla proposer à Malaga, la reine des danses de carnaval, de passer une
nuit au bal Musard, quand il sut que la comtesse, déguisée jusqu'aux
dents, devait venir voir, avec deux autres jeunes femmes accompagnées de
leurs maris, le curieux spectacle d'un de ces bals monstrueux. Le
mardi-gras de l'année 1838, à quatre heures du matin, la comtesse,
enveloppée d'un domino noir et assise sur les gradins d'un des
amphithéâtres de cette salle babylonienne, où depuis Valentino donne ses
concerts, vit défiler dans le galop Thaddée en Robert-Macaire conduisant
l'écuyère en costume de sauvagesse, la tête harnachée de plumes comme un
cheval du sacre, et bondissant par-dessus les groupes, en vrai feu
follet.
--Ah! dit Clémentine à son mari, vous autres Polonais, vous êtes des
gens sans caractère. Qui n'aurait pas eu confiance en Thaddée? Il m'a
donné sa parole, sans savoir que je serais ici voyant tout et n'étant
pas vue.
Quelques jours après, elle eut Paz à dîner. Après le dîner, Adam les
laissa seuls, et Clémentine gronda Thaddée de manière à lui faire sentir
qu'elle ne le voulait plus au logis.
--Oui, madame, dit humblement Thaddée, vous avez raison, je suis un
misérable, j'avais donné ma parole. Mais que voulez-vous? j'avais remis
à quitter Malaga après le carnaval... Je serai franc, d'ailleurs: cette
femme exerce un tel empire sur moi que...
--Une femme qui se fait mettre à la porte de chez Musard par les
sergents de ville, et pour quelle danse!
--J'en conviens, je passe condamnation, je quitterai _votre_ maison;
mais vous connaissez Adam. Si je vous abandonne les rênes de votre
fortune, il vous faudra déployer bien de l'énergie. Si j'ai le vice de
Malaga, je sais avoir l'oeil à vos affaires, tenir vos gens et veiller
aux moindres détails. Laissez-moi donc ne vous quitter qu'après vous
avoir vue en état de continuer mon administration. Vous avez maintenant
trois ans de mariage, et vous êtes à l'abri des premières folies que
fait faire la lune de miel. Les Parisiennes, et les plus titrées,
s'entendent aujourd'hui très-bien à gouverner une fortune et une
maison... Eh bien! quand je serai certain moins de votre capacité que de
votre fermeté, je quitterai Paris.
--C'est le Thaddée de Varsovie et non le Thaddée du Cirque qui parle,
répondit-elle. Revenez-nous guéri.
--Guéri?... jamais, dit Paz les yeux baissés en regardant les jolis
pieds de Clémentine. Vous ignorez, comtesse, ce que cette femme a de
piquant et d'inattendu dans l'esprit. En sentant son courage faillir, il
ajouta:--Il n'y a pas de femme du monde avec ses airs de mijaurée qui
vaille cette franche nature de jeune animal...
--Le fait est que je ne voudrais rien avoir d'animal, dit la comtesse en
lui lançant un regard de vipère en colère.
A compter de cette matinée, le comte Paz mit Clémentine au fait de ses
affaires, se fit son précepteur, lui apprit les difficultés de la
gestion de ses biens, le véritable prix des choses et la manière de ne
point se laisser trop voler par les gens. Elle pouvait compter sur
Constantin et faire de lui son majordome. Thaddée avait formé
Constantin. Au mois de mai, la comtesse lui parut parfaitement en état
de conduire sa fortune; car Clémentine était de ces femmes au coup
d'oeil juste, plein d'instinct, et chez qui le génie de la maîtresse de
maison est inné.
Cette situation amenée par Thaddée avec tant de naturel eut une
péripétie horrible pour lui, car ses souffrances ne devaient pas être
aussi douces qu'il se les faisait. Ce pauvre amant n'avait pas compté le
hasard pour quelque chose. Or, Adam tomba très-sérieusement malade.
Thaddée, au lieu de partir, servit de garde-malade à son ami. Le
dévouement du capitaine fut infatigable. Une femme qui aurait eu de
l'intérêt à déployer la longue-vue de la perspicacité, eût vu dans
l'héroïsme du capitaine une sorte de punition que s'imposent les âmes
nobles pour réprimer leurs mauvaises pensées involontaires; mais les
femmes voient tout ou ne voient rien, selon leurs dispositions d'âme:
l'amour est leur seule lumière.
Pendant quarante-cinq jours, Paz veilla, soigna Mitgislas sans qu'il
parût penser à Malaga, par l'excellente raison qu'il n'y avait jamais
pensé. En voyant Adam à la mort et ne mourant pas, Clémentine assembla
les plus célèbres docteurs.
--S'il se sauve de là, dit le plus savant des médecins, ce ne peut être
que par un effort de la nature. C'est à ceux qui lui donnent des soins à
guetter ce moment et seconder la nature. La vie du comte est entre les
mains de ses garde-malades.
Thaddée alla communiquer cet arrêt à Clémentine, alors assise sous le
pavillon chinois, autant pour se reposer de ses fatigues que pour
laisser le champ libre aux médecins et ne pas les gêner. En suivant les
contours de l'allée sablée qui menait du boudoir au rocher sur lequel
s'élevait le pavillon chinois, l'amant de Clémentine était comme au fond
d'un des abîmes décrits par Alighieri. Le malheureux n'avait pas prévu
la possibilité de devenir le mari de Clémentine et s'était enfermé
lui-même dans une fosse de boue. Il arriva le visage décomposé, sublime
de douleur. Sa tête, comme celle de Méduse, communiquait le désespoir.
--Il est mort?... dit Clémentine.
--Ils l'ont condamné; du moins, ils le remettent à la nature. N'y allez
pas, ils y sont encore, et Bianchon va lever lui-même les appareils.
--Pauvre homme! je me demande si je ne l'ai pas quelquefois tourmenté,
dit-elle.
--Vous l'avez rendu bien heureux, soyez tranquille à ce sujet, dit
Thaddée et vous avez eu de l'indulgence pour lui...
--Ma perte serait irréparable.
--Mais, chère, en supposant que le comte succombe, ne l'aviez-vous pas
jugé?
--Je l'aimais sans aveuglement, dit-elle; mais je l'aimais comme une
femme doit aimer son mari.
--Vous devez donc, reprit Thaddée d'une voix que ne lui connaissait pas
Clémentine, avoir moins de regrets que si vous perdiez un de ces hommes
qui sont votre orgueil, votre amour et toute votre vie, à vous autres
femmes! Vous pouvez être sincère avec un ami tel que moi... Je le
regretterai, moi!... Bien avant votre mariage, j'avais fait de lui mon
enfant, et je lui ai sacrifié ma vie. Je serai donc sans intérêt sur la
terre. Mais la vie est encore belle à une veuve de vingt-quatre ans.
--Eh! vous savez bien que je n'aime personne, dit-elle avec la
brusquerie de la douleur.
--Vous ne savez pas encore ce que c'est que d'aimer, dit Thaddée.
--Oh! mari pour mari, je suis assez sensée pour préférer un enfant comme
mon pauvre Adam à un homme supérieur. Voici bientôt trente jours que
nous nous disons: Vivra-t-il? ces alternatives m'ont bien préparée,
ainsi que vous l'êtes, à cette perte. Je puis être franche avec vous. Eh
bien! je donnerais de ma vie pour conserver celle d'Adam. L'indépendance
d'une femme à Paris, n'est-ce pas la permission de se laisser prendre
aux semblants d'amour des gens ruinés ou dissipateurs! Je priais Dieu de
me laisser ce mari si complaisant, si bon enfant, si peu tracassier, et
qui commençait à me craindre.
--Vous êtes vraie, et je vous en aime davantage, dit Thaddée en prenant
et baisant la main de Clémentine qui le laissa faire. Dans de si
solennels instants, il y a je ne sais quelle satisfaction à trouver une
femme sans hypocrisie. On peut causer avec vous. Voyons l'avenir;
supposons que Dieu ne vous écoute pas, et je suis un de ceux qui sont le
plus disposés à lui crier:--Laissez-moi mon ami! Oui, ces cinquante
nuits n'ont pas affaibli mes yeux, et fallût-il trente jours et trente
nuits de soins, vous dormirez, vous, madame, quand je veillerai. Je
saurai l'arracher à la mort si, comme _ils_ le disent, on peut le sauver
par des soins. Enfin, malgré vous et malgré moi, le comte est mort. Eh
bien! si vous étiez aimée, oh! mais adorée par un homme de coeur et d'un
caractère digne du vôtre...
--J'ai peut-être follement désiré d'être aimée, mais je n'ai pas
rencontré...
--Si vous aviez été trompée...
Clémentine regarda fixement Thaddée en lui supposant moins de l'amour
qu'une pensée cupide, elle le couvrit de son mépris en le toisant des
pieds à la tête, et l'écrasa par ces deux mots: Pauvre Malaga! prononcés
en trois tons que les grandes dames seules savent trouver dans le
registre de leurs dédains. Elle se leva, laissa Thaddée évanoui, car
elle ne se retourna point, marcha d'un mouvement noble vers son boudoir
et remonta dans la chambre d'Adam.
Une heure après, Paz revint dans la chambre du malade; et comme s'il
n'avait pas reçu le coup de la mort, il prodigua ses soins au comte.
Depuis ce fatal moment il devint taciturne; il eut d'ailleurs un duel
avec la maladie, il la combattait de manière à exciter l'admiration des
médecins. A toute heure on trouvait ses yeux allumés comme deux lampes.
Sans témoigner le moindre ressentiment à Clémentine, il écoutait ses
remercîments sans les accepter, il semblait être sourd. Il s'était dit:
Elle me devra la vie d'Adam! et cette parole, il l'écrivait pour ainsi
dire en traits de feu dans la chambre du malade. Le quinzième jour,
Clémentine fut obligée de restreindre ses soins, sous peine de succomber
à tant de fatigues. Paz était infatigable. Enfin, vers la fin du mois
d'août, Bianchon, le médecin de la maison, répondit de la vie du comte à
Clémentine.
--Ah! madame, ne m'en ayez pas la moindre obligation, dit-il. Sans son
ami nous ne l'aurions pas sauvé!
Le lendemain de la terrible scène sous le pavillon chinois, le marquis
de Ronquerolles était venu voir son neveu; car il partait pour la Russie
chargé d'une mission secrète, et Paz, foudroyé de la veille, avait dit
quelques mots au diplomate. Or, le jour où le comte Adam et sa femme
sortirent pour la première fois en calèche, au moment où la calèche
allait quitter le perron, un gendarme entra dans la cour de l'hôtel et
demanda le comte Paz. Thaddée, assis sur le devant de la calèche, se
retourna pour prendre une lettre qui portait le timbre du ministère des
affaires étrangères et la mit dans la poche de côté de son habit par un
mouvement qui empêcha Clémentine et Adam de lui en parler. On ne peut
nier aux gens de bonne compagnie la science du langage qui ne se parle
pas. Néanmoins, en arrivant à la porte Maillot, Adam, usant des
priviléges d'un convalescent dont les caprices doivent être satisfaits,
dit à Thaddée:--Il n'y a point d'indiscrétion entre deux frères qui
s'aiment autant que nous nous aimons, tu sais ce que contient la
dépêche, dis-le moi, j'ai une fièvre de curiosité.
Clémentine regarda Thaddée en femme fâchée et dit à son mari:
Il me boude tant depuis deux mois que je me garderais bien d'insister.
--Oh! mon Dieu, répondit Thaddée, comme je ne puis pas empêcher les
journaux de le publier, je vous révélerai bien ce secret: l'empereur
Nicolas me fait la grâce de me nommer capitaine dans un régiment destiné
à l'expédition de Khiva.
--Et tu y vas? s'écria Adam.
--J'irai, mon cher. Je suis venu capitaine, capitaine je m'en
retourne... Malaga pourrait me faire faire des sottises. Nous dînons
demain pour la dernière fois ensemble. Si je ne partais pas en septembre
pour Saint-Pétersbourg, il faudrait y aller par terre, et je ne suis pas
riche, je dois laisser à Malaga sa petite indépendance. Comment ne pas
veiller à l'avenir de la seule femme qui m'ait su comprendre? elle me
trouve grand, Malaga! Malaga me trouve beau! Malaga m'est peut-être
infidèle, mais elle passerait dans le...
--Dans le cerceau pour vous et retomberait très-bien sur son cheval, dit
vivement Clémentine.
--Oh! vous ne connaissez pas Malaga, dit le capitaine avec une profonde
amertume et un regard plein d'ironie qui rendirent Clémentine rêveuse et
inquiète.
--Adieu les jeunes arbres de ce beau bois de Boulogne où se promènent
les Parisiennes, où se promènent les exilés qui y retrouvent une patrie.
Je suis sûr que mes yeux ne reverront plus les arbres verts de l'allée
de Mademoiselle, ni ceux de la route des Dames, ni les acacias, ni le
cèdre des ronds-points... Sur les bords de l'Asie, obéissant aux
desseins du grand empereur que j'ai voulu pour maître, arriver peut-être
au commandement d'une armée à force de courage, à force de mettre ma vie
au jeu, peut-être regretterai-je les Champs-Élysées où vous m'avez, une
fois, fait monter à côté de vous. Enfin, je regretterai toujours les
rigueurs de Malaga, la Malaga de qui je parle en ce moment.
Ce fut dit de manière à faire frissonner Clémentine.
--Vous aimez donc bien Malaga? demanda-t-elle.
--Je lui ai sacrifié cet honneur que nous ne sacrifions jamais...
--Lequel?
--Mais celui que nous voulons garder à tout prix aux yeux de notre
idole.
Après cette réponse, Thaddée garda le plus impénétrable silence; et il
ne le rompit qu'en passant aux Champs-Élysées, où il dit en montrant un
bâtiment en planches:--Voilà le Cirque!
Il alla quelques moments avant le dîner à l'ambassade de Russie, de là
aux affaires étrangères, et il partit pour le Havre le matin, avant le
lever de la comtesse et d'Adam.
--Je perds un ami, dit Adam les larmes aux yeux en apprenant le départ
du comte Paz, un ami dans la véritable acception du mot, et je ne sais
pas ce qui peut lui faire fuir ma maison comme la peste. Nous ne sommes
pas amis à nous brouiller pour une femme, dit-il en regardant fixement
Clémentine, et cependant tout ce qu'il disait hier de Malaga... Mais il
n'a jamais touché le bout du doigt à cette fille...
--Comment le savez-vous? dit Clémentine.
--Mais j'ai naturellement eu la curiosité de voir mademoiselle Turquet,
et la pauvre fille ne peut pas encore s'expliquer la réserve absolue de
Thad...
--Assez, monsieur, dit la comtesse, qui se retira chez elle en se
disant:--Ne serais-je pas victime d'une mystification sublime?
A peine achevait-elle cette phrase en elle-même, que Constantin remit à
Clémentine la lettre suivante, que Thaddée avait griffonnée pendant la
nuit.
   «Comtesse, aller se faire tuer au Caucase et emporter votre mépris,
  c'est trop: on doit mourir tout entier. Je vous ai chérie en vous
  voyant pour la première fois, comme on chérit une femme que l'on aime
  toujours, même après son infidélité, moi l'obligé d'Adam qui vous
  avait choisie et que vous épousiez, moi pauvre, moi le régisseur
  volontaire, dévoué de votre maison. Dans cet horrible malheur, j'ai
  trouvé la plus délicieuse vie. Être chez vous un rouage indispensable,
  me savoir utile à votre luxe, à votre bien-être, fut une source de
  jouissances; et si ces jouissances étaient vives dans mon âme quand il
  s'agissait d'Adam, jugez de ce qu'elles furent alors qu'une femme
  adorée en était le principe et l'effet! J'ai connu les plaisirs de la
  maternité dans l'amour: j'acceptais la vie ainsi. Je m'étais, comme
  les pauvres des grands chemins, bâti une cabane de cailloux sur la
  litière de votre beau domaine, sans vous tendre la main. Pauvre et
  malheureux, aveuglé par le bonheur d'Adam, j'étais le donnant. Ah!
  vous étiez entourée d'un amour pur comme celui d'un ange gardien, il
  veillait quand vous dormiez, il vous caressait du regard quand vous
  passiez, il était heureux d'être, enfin vous étiez le soleil de la
  patrie à ce pauvre exilé, qui vous écrit les larmes aux yeux en
  pensant à ce bonheur des premiers jours. A dix-huit ans, n'étant aimé
  de personne, j'avais pris pour maîtresse idéale une charmante femme de
  Varsovie à qui je rapportais mes pensées, mes désirs, la reine de mes
  jours et de mes nuits! Cette femme n'en savait rien; mais pourquoi
  l'en instruire?... Moi! j'aimais mon amour. Jugez, d'après cette
  aventure de ma jeunesse, combien j'étais heureux de vivre dans la
  sphère de votre existence, de panser votre cheval, de chercher des
  pièces d'or toutes neuves pour votre bourse, de veiller aux splendeurs
  de votre table et de vos soirées, de vous voir éclipsant des fortunes
  supérieures à la vôtre par mon savoir-faire. Avec quelle ardeur ne me
  précipitais-je pas dans Paris quand Adam me disait:--Thaddée, _elle_
  veut telle chose! C'est une de ces félicités impossibles à exprimer.
  Vous avez souhaité des riens, dans un temps donné, qui m'ont obligé à
  des tours de force, à courir pendant des sept heures en cabriolet; et
  quelles délices de marcher pour vous! A vous voir souriante au milieu
  de vos fleurs, sans être vu de vous, j'oubliais que personne ne
  m'aimait... Enfin je n'avais alors que mes dix-huit ans. Par certains
  jours où mon bonheur me tournait la tête, j'allais, la nuit, baiser
  l'endroit où, pour moi, vos pieds laissaient des traces lumineuses,
  comme jadis je fis des miracles de voleur pour aller baiser la clef
  que la comtesse Ladislas avait touchée de ses mains en ouvrant une
  porte. L'air que vous respiriez était balsamique; il y avait pour moi
  plus de vie à l'aspirer, et j'y étais comme on est, dit-on, sous les
  tropiques, accablé par une vapeur chargée de principes créateurs. Il
  faut bien vous dire ces choses pour vous expliquer l'étrange fatuité
  de mes pensées involontaires. Je serais mort avant de vous avouer mon
  secret! Vous devez vous rappeler les quelques jours de curiosité
  pendant lesquels vous avez voulu voir l'auteur des miracles qui vous
  avaient enfin frappée. J'ai cru, pardonnez-moi, madame, j'ai cru que
  vous m'aimeriez. Votre bienveillance, vos regards interprétés par un
  amant, m'ont paru si dangereux pour moi, que je me suis donné Malaga,
  sachant qu'il est de ces liaisons que les femmes ne pardonnent point:
  je me la suis donnée au moment où j'ai vu mon amour se communiquer
  fatalement. Accablez-moi maintenant du mépris que vous m'avez versé à
  pleines mains sans que je le méritasse; mais je crois être certain que
  dans la soirée où votre tante a emmené le comte, si je vous avais dit
  ce que je viens de vous écrire l'ayant dit une fois, j'aurais été
  comme le tigre apprivoisé qui a remis ses dents à de la chair vivante,
  qui sent la chaleur du sang, et...
  «Minuit,
  «Je n'ai pu continuer, le souvenir de cette heure est encore trop
  vivant! Oui, j'eus alors le délire. L'Espérance était dans vos yeux,
  la Victoire et ses pavillons rouges eussent brillé dans les miens et
  fasciné les vôtres. Mon crime a été de penser tout cela, peut-être à
  tort. Vous seule êtes le juge de cette terrible scène où j'ai pu
  refouler amour, désir, les forces les plus invincibles de l'homme,
  sous la main glaciale d'une reconnaissance qui doit être éternelle.
  Votre terrible mépris m'a puni. Vous m'avez prouvé qu'on ne revient ni
  du dégoût ni du mépris. Je vous aime comme un insensé. Je serais
  parti, Adam mort: je dois à plus forte raison partir, Adam sauvé. L'on
  n'arrache pas son ami des bras de la mort pour le tromper. D'ailleurs,
  mon départ est la punition de la pensée que j'ai eue de le laisser
  périr quand les médecins m'ont dit que sa vie dépendait de ses
  garde-malades. Adieu, madame; je perds tout en quittant Paris, et vous
  ne perdez rien en n'ayant plus auprès de vous
  «Votre dévoué
  «_Thaddée Paç_.»
--Si mon pauvre Adam dit avoir perdu un ami, qu'ai-je donc perdu, moi?
se dit Clémentine en restant abattue et les yeux attachés sur une fleur
de son tapis.
Voici la lettre que Constantin remit en secret au comte.
  «Mon cher Mitgislas, Malaga m'a tout dit. Au nom de ton bonheur, qu'il
  ne t'échappe jamais avec Clémentine un mot sur tes visites chez
  l'écuyère, et laisse-lui toujours croire que Malaga me coûte cent
  mille francs. Du caractère dont est la comtesse, elle ne te
  pardonnerait ni tes pertes au jeu ni tes visites à Malaga. Je ne vais
  pas à Khiva, mais au Caucase. J'ai le spleen, et du train dont j'irai,
  je serai prince Paz en trois ans ou mort. Adieu; quoique j'aie repris
  soixante mille francs chez Rothschild, nous sommes quittes.
  «_Thaddée._»
--Imbécile que je suis! j'ai failli me couper tout à l'heure, se dit
Adam.
Voici trois ans que Thaddée est parti, les journaux ne parlent encore
d'aucun prince Paz. La comtesse Laginska s'intéresse énormément aux
expéditions de l'empereur Nicolas, elle est Russe de coeur, elle lit
avec une espèce d'avidité toutes les nouvelles qui viennent de ce pays.
Une ou deux fois par hiver, elle dit d'un air indifférent à
l'ambassadeur: «Savez-vous ce qu'est devenu notre pauvre comte Paz?»
Hélas! la plupart des Parisiennes, ces créatures prétendues si
perspicaces et si spirituelles, passent et passeront toujours à côté
d'un Paz sans l'apercevoir. Oui, plus d'un Paz est méconnu; mais, chose
effrayante à penser! il en est de méconnus même lorsqu'ils sont aimés.
La femme la plus simple du monde exige encore chez l'homme le plus grand
un peu de charlatanisme; et le plus bel amour ne signifie rien quand il
est brut: il lui faut la mise en scène de la taille et de l'orfévrerie.
Au mois de janvier 1842, la comtesse Laginska, parée de sa douce
mélancolie, inspira la plus furieuse passion au comte de La Palférine,
un des lions les plus entreprenants du Paris actuel. La Palférine
comprit combien la conquête d'une femme gardée par une Chimère était
difficile, il compta sur une surprise et sur le dévouement d'une femme
un peu jalouse de Clémentine pour entraîner cette charmante femme.
Incapable, malgré tout son esprit, de soupçonner une trahison pareille,
la comtesse Laginska commit l'imprudence d'aller avec cette femme au bal
masqué de l'Opéra. Vers trois heures du matin, entraînée par l'ivresse
du bal, Clémentine, pour qui La Palférine avait déployé toutes ses
séductions, consentit à souper et allait monter dans la voiture de cette
fausse amie. En ce moment critique, elle fut prise par un bras
vigoureux, et, malgré ses cris, portée dans sa propre voiture, dont la
portière était ouverte, et qu'elle ne savait pas là.
--Il n'a pas quitté Paris, s'écria-t-elle en reconnaissant Thaddée, qui
se sauva quand il vit la voiture emportant la comtesse.
Jamais femme eut-elle un pareil roman dans sa vie. A toute heure,
Clémentine espère revoir Paz.
  Paris, janvier 1842.
ÉTUDE DE FEMME
  DÉDIÉ AU MARQUIS JEAN-CHARLES DI NEGRO.
La marquise de Listomère est une de ces jeunes femmes élevées dans
l'esprit de la Restauration. Elle a des principes, elle fait maigre,
elle communie, et va très-parée au bal, aux Bouffons, à l'Opéra; son
directeur lui permet d'allier le profane et le sacré. Toujours en règle
avec l'Église et avec le monde, elle offre une image du temps présent,
qui semble avoir pris le mot de _Légalité_ pour épigraphe. La conduite
de la marquise comporte précisément assez de dévotion pour pouvoir
arriver sous une nouvelle Maintenon à la sombre piété des derniers jours
de Louis XIV, et assez de mondanité pour adopter également les moeurs
galantes des premiers jours de ce règne, s'il revenait. En ce moment,
elle est vertueuse par calcul, ou par goût peut-être. Mariée depuis sept
ans au marquis de Listomère, un de ces députés qui attendent la pairie,
elle croit peut-être aussi servir par sa conduite l'ambition de sa
famille. Quelques femmes attendent pour la juger le moment où monsieur
de Listomère sera pair de France, et où elle aura trente-six ans, époque
de la vie où la plupart des femmes s'aperçoivent qu'elles sont dupes des
lois sociales. Le marquis est un homme assez insignifiant: il est bien
en cour, ses qualités sont négatives comme ses défauts; les unes ne
peuvent pas plus lui faire une réputation de vertu que les autres ne lui
donnent l'espèce d'éclat jeté par les vices. Député, il ne parle jamais,
mais il vote _bien_; il se comporte dans son ménage comme à la Chambre.
Aussi passe-t-il pour être le meilleur mari de France. S'il n'est pas
susceptible de s'exalter, il ne gronde jamais, à moins qu'on ne le fasse
attendre. Ses amis l'ont nommé _le temps couvert_. Il ne se rencontre en
effet chez lui ni lumière trop vive, ni obscurité complète. Il ressemble
à tous les ministères qui se sont succédé en France depuis la Charte.
Pour une femme à principes, il était difficile de tomber en de
meilleures mains. N'est-ce pas beaucoup pour une femme vertueuse que
d'avoir épousé un homme incapable de faire des sottises? Il s'est
rencontré des dandies qui ont eu l'impertinence de presser légèrement la
main de la marquise en dansant avec elle, ils n'ont recueilli que des
regards de mépris, et tous ont éprouvé cette indifférence insultante
qui, semblable aux gelées du printemps, détruit le germe des plus belles
espérances. Les beaux, les spirituels, les fats, les hommes à sentiments
qui se nourrissent en tenant leurs cannes, ceux à grand nom ou à grosse
renommée, les gens de haute et petite volée, auprès d'elle tout a
blanchi. Elle a conquis le droit de causer aussi longtemps et aussi
souvent qu'elle le veut avec les hommes qui lui semblent spirituels,
sans qu'elle soit couchée sur l'album de la médisance. Certaines femmes
coquettes sont capables de suivre ce plan-là pendant sept ans pour
satisfaire plus tard leurs fantaisies; mais supposer cette
arrière-pensée à la marquise de Listomère serait la calomnier. J'ai eu
le bonheur de voir ce phénix des marquises: elle cause bien, je sais
écouter, je lui ai plu, je vais à ses soirées. Tel était le but de mon
ambition. Ni laide ni jolie, madame de Listomère a des dents blanches,
le teint éclatant et les lèvres très-rouges; elle est grande et bien
faite; elle a le pied petit, fluet, et ne l'avance pas; ses yeux, loin
d'être éteints, comme le sont presque tous les yeux parisiens, ont un
éclat doux qui devient magique si par hasard elle s'anime. On devine une
âme à travers cette forme indécise. Si elle s'intéresse à la
conversation, elle y déploie une grâce ensevelie sous les précautions
d'un maintien froid, et alors elle est charmante. Elle ne veut pas de
succès et en obtient. On trouve toujours ce qu'on ne cherche pas. Cette
phrase est trop souvent vraie pour ne pas se changer un jour en
proverbe. Ce sera la moralité de cette aventure, que je ne me
permettrais pas de raconter, si elle ne retentissait en ce moment dans
tous les salons de Paris.
La marquise de Listomère a dansé, il y a un mois environ, avec un jeune
homme aussi modeste qu'il est étourdi, plein de bonnes qualités, et ne
laissant voir que ses défauts; il est passionné et se moque des
passions; il a du talent et il le cache; il fait le savant avec les
aristocrates et fait de l'aristocratie avec les savants. Eugène de
Rastignac est un de ces jeunes gens très-sensés qui essaient de tout et
semblent tâter les hommes pour savoir ce que porte l'avenir. En
attendant l'âge de l'ambition, il se moque de tout; il a de la grâce et
de l'originalité, deux qualités rares parce qu'elles s'excluent l'une
l'autre. Il a causé sans préméditation de succès avec la marquise de
Listomère, pendant une demi-heure environ. En se jouant des caprices
d'une conversation qui, après avoir commencé à l'opéra de _Guillaume
Tell_, en était venue aux devoirs des femmes, il avait plus d'une fois
regardé la marquise de manière à l'embarrasser; puis il la quitta et ne
lui parla plus de toute la soirée; il dansa, se mit à l'écarté, perdit
quelque argent, et s'en alla se coucher. J'ai l'honneur de vous affirmer
que tout se passa ainsi. Je n'ajoute, je ne retranche rien.
Le lendemain matin Rastignac se réveilla tard, resta dans son lit, où il
se livra sans doute à quelques-unes de ces rêveries matinales pendant
lesquelles un jeune homme se glisse comme un sylphe sous plus d'une
courtine de soie, de cachemire ou de coton. En ces moments, plus le
corps est lourd de sommeil, plus l'esprit est agile. Enfin Rastignac se
leva sans trop bâiller, comme font tant de gens mal appris, sonna son
valet de chambre, se fit apprêter du thé, en but immodérément, ce qui ne
paraîtra pas extraordinaire aux personnes qui aiment le thé; mais pour
expliquer cette circonstance aux gens qui ne l'acceptent que comme la
panacée des indigestions, j'ajouterai qu'Eugène écrivait: il était
commodément assis, et avait les pieds plus souvent sur ses chenets que
dans sa chancelière. Oh! avoir les pieds sur la barre polie qui réunit
les deux griffons d'un garde-cendre, et penser à ses amours quand on se
lève et qu'on est en robe de chambre, est chose si délicieuse, que je
regrette infiniment de n'avoir ni maîtresse, ni chenets, ni robe de
chambre. Quand j'aurai tout cela, je ne raconterai pas mes observations,
j'en profiterai.
La première lettre qu'Eugène écrivit fut achevée en un quart d'heure; il
la plia, la cacheta et la laissa devant lui sans y mettre l'adresse. La
seconde lettre, commencée à onze heures, ne fut finie qu'à midi. Les
quatre pages étaient pleines.
--Cette femme me trotte dans la tête, dit-il en pliant cette seconde
épître, qu'il laissa devant lui, comptant y mettre l'adresse après avoir
achevé sa rêverie involontaire. Il croisa les deux pans de sa robe de
chambre à ramages, posa ses pieds sur un tabouret, coula ses mains dans
les goussets de son pantalon de cachemire rouge, et se renversa dans une
délicieuse bergère à oreilles dont le siége et le dossier décrivaient
l'angle confortable de cent vingt degrés. Il ne prit plus de thé et
resta immobile, les yeux attachés sur la main dorée qui couronnait sa
pelle, sans voir ni main, ni pelle, ni dorure. Il ne tisonna même pas.
Faute immense! N'est-ce pas un plaisir bien vif que de tracasser le feu
quand on pense aux femmes? Notre esprit prête des phrases aux petites
langues bleues qui se dégagent soudain et babillent dans le foyer. On
interprète le langage puissant et brusque d'un _bourguignon_.
A ce mot arrêtons-nous, et plaçons ici pour les ignorants une
explication due à un étymologiste très-distingué qui a désiré garder
l'anonyme. _Bourguignon_ est le nom populaire et symbolique donné,
depuis le règne de Charles VI, à ces détonations bruyantes dont l'effet
est d'envoyer sur un tapis ou sur une robe un petit charbon, léger
principe d'incendie. Le feu dégage, dit-on, une bulle d'air qu'un ver
rongeur a laissée dans le coeur du bois. _Inde amor, inde burgundus._
L'on tremble en voyant rouler comme une avalanche le charbon qu'on avait
si industrieusement essayé de poser entre deux bûches flamboyantes. Oh!
tisonner quand on aime, n'est-ce pas développer matériellement sa
pensée!
Ce fut en ce moment que j'entrai chez Eugène, il fit un soubresaut et me
dit:--Ah! te voilà, mon cher Horace. Depuis quand es-tu là?
--J'arrive.
--Ah!
Il prit les deux lettres, y mit les adresses et sonna son domestique.
--Porte cela en ville.
Et Joseph y alla sans faire d'observations; excellent domestique!
Nous nous mîmes à causer de l'expédition de Morée, dans laquelle je
désirais être employé en qualité de médecin. Eugène me fit observer que
je perdrais beaucoup à quitter Paris, et nous parlâmes de choses
indifférentes. Je ne crois pas que l'on me sache mauvais gré de
supprimer notre conversation.
  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
Au moment où la marquise de Listomère se leva, sur les deux heures après
midi, sa femme de chambre, Caroline, lui remit une lettre, elle la lut
pendant que Caroline la coiffait. (Imprudence que commettent beaucoup de
jeunes femmes.)
_O cher ange d'amour, trésor de vie et de bonheur!_ A ces mots, la
marquise allait jeter la lettre au feu; mais il lui passa par la tête
une fantaisie que toute femme vertueuse comprendra merveilleusement, et
qui était de voir comment un homme qui débutait ainsi pouvait finir.
Elle lut. Quand elle eut tourné la quatrième page, elle laissa tomber
ses bras comme une personne fatiguée.
--Caroline, allez savoir qui a remis cette lettre chez moi.
--Madame, je l'ai reçue du valet de chambre de monsieur le baron de
Rastignac.
Il se fit un long silence.
--Madame veut-elle s'habiller? demanda Caroline.
--Non.
--Il faut qu'il soit bien impertinent! pensa la marquise.
  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
Je prie toutes les femmes d'imaginer elles-mêmes le commentaire.
Madame de Listomère termina le sien par la résolution formelle de
consigner monsieur Eugène à sa porte, et si elle le rencontrait dans le
monde de lui témoigner plus que du dédain; car son insolence ne pouvait
se comparer à aucune de celles que la marquise avait fini par excuser.
Elle voulut d'abord garder la lettre; mais, toute réflexion faite, elle
la brûla.
--Madame vient de recevoir une fameuse déclaration d'amour, et elle l'a
lue! dit Caroline à la femme de charge.
--Je n'aurais jamais cru cela de madame, répondit la vieille tout
étonnée.
Le soir, la comtesse alla chez le marquis de Beauséant, où Rastignac
devait probablement se trouver. C'était un samedi. Le marquis de
Beauséant étant un peu parent à monsieur de Rastignac, ce jeune homme ne
pouvait manquer de venir pendant la soirée. A deux heures du matin,
madame de Listomère, qui n'était restée que pour accabler Eugène de sa
froideur, l'avait attendu vainement. Un homme d'esprit, Stendhal, a eu
la bizarre idée de nommer _cristallisation_ le travail que la pensée de
la marquise fit avant, pendant et après cette soirée.
Quatre jours après, Eugène grondait son valet de chambre.
--Ah çà! Joseph, je vais être forcé de te renvoyer, mon garçon!
--Plaît-il, monsieur?
--Tu ne fais que des sottises. Où as-tu porté les deux lettres que je
t'ai remises vendredi?
Joseph devint stupide. Semblable à quelque statue du porche d'une
cathédrale, il resta immobile, entièrement absorbé par le travail de son
imaginative. Tout à coup il sourit bêtement et dit:
--Monsieur, l'une était pour madame la marquise de Listomère, rue Saint
Dominique, et l'autre pour l'avoué de monsieur...
--Es-tu certain de ce que tu dis là?
Joseph demeura tout interdit. Je vis bien qu'il fallait que je m'en
mêlasse, moi qui, par hasard, me trouvais encore là.
--Joseph a raison, dis-je. Eugène se tourna de mon côté.--J'ai lu les
adresses fort involontairement, et...
--Et, dit Eugène en m'interrompant, l'une des lettres n'était pas pour
madame de Nucingen?
--Non, de par tous les diables! Aussi, ai-je cru, mon cher, que ton
coeur avait pirouetté de la rue Saint-Lazare à la rue Saint-Dominique.
Eugène se frappa le front du plat de la main et se mit à sourire. Joseph
vit bien que la faute ne venait pas de lui.
Maintenant, voilà où sont les moralités que tous les jeunes gens
devraient méditer. _Première faute_: Eugène trouva plaisant de faire
rire madame de Listomère de la méprise qui l'avait rendue maîtresse
d'une lettre d'amour qui n'était pas pour elle. _Deuxième faute_: il
n'alla chez madame de Listomère que quatre jours après l'aventure,
laissant ainsi les pensées d'une vertueuse jeune femme se cristalliser.
Il se trouvait encore une dizaine de fautes qu'il faut passer sous
silence, afin de donner aux dames le plaisir de les déduire _ex
professo_ à ceux qui ne les devineront pas. Eugène arrive à la porte de
la marquise; mais quand il veut passer, le concierge l'arrête et lui dit
que madame la marquise est sortie. Comme il remontait en voiture, le
marquis entra.
--Venez donc Eugène, ma femme est chez elle.
Oh! excusez le marquis. Un mari, quelque bon qu'il soit, atteint
difficilement à la perfection. En montant l'escalier, Rastignac
s'aperçut alors des dix fautes de logique mondaine qui se trouvaient
dans ce passage du beau livre de sa vie. Quand madame de Listomère vit
son mari entrant avec Eugène, elle ne put s'empêcher de rougir. Le jeune
baron observa cette rougeur subite. Si l'homme le plus modeste conserve
encore un petit fonds de fatuité dont il ne se dépouille pas plus que la
femme ne se sépare de sa fatale coquetterie, qui pourrait blâmer Eugène
de s'être alors dit en lui-même:--Quoi! cette forteresse aussi? Et il se
posa dans sa cravate. Quoique les jeunes gens ne soient pas très-avares,
ils aiment tous à mettre une tête de plus dans leur médaillier.
Monsieur de Listomère se saisit de la _Gazette de France_, qu'il aperçut
dans un coin de la cheminée, et alla vers l'embrasure d'une fenêtre pour
acquérir, le journaliste aidant, une opinion à lui sur l'état de la
France. Une femme, voire même une prude, ne reste pas long-temps
embarrassée, même dans la situation la plus difficile où elle puisse se
trouver: il semble qu'elle ait toujours à la main la feuille de figuier
que lui a donnée notre mère Ève. Aussi, quand Eugène, interprétant en
faveur de sa vanité la consigne donnée à la porte, salua madame de
Listomère d'un air passablement délibéré, sut-elle voiler toutes ses
pensées par un de ces sourires féminins plus impénétrables que ne l'est
la parole d'un roi.
--Seriez-vous indisposée, madame? vous aviez fait défendre votre porte.
--Non, monsieur.
--Vous alliez sortir, peut-être?
--Pas davantage.
--Vous attendiez quelqu'un?
--Personne.
--Si ma visite est indiscrète, ne vous en prenez qu'à monsieur le
marquis. J'obéissais à votre mystérieuse consigne quand il m'a lui-même
introduit dans le sanctuaire.
--Monsieur de Listomère n'était pas dans ma confidence. Il n'est pas
toujours prudent de mettre un mari au fait de certains secrets...
L'accent ferme et doux avec lequel la marquise prononça ces paroles et
le regard imposant qu'elle lança firent bien juger à Rastignac qu'il
s'était trop pressé de se poser dans sa cravate.
--Madame, je vous comprends, dit-il en riant; je dois alors me
féliciter doublement d'avoir rencontré monsieur le marquis, il me
procure l'occasion de vous présenter une justification qui serait pleine
de dangers si vous n'étiez pas la bonté même.
La marquise regarda le jeune baron d'un air assez étonné; mais elle
répondit avec dignité:--Monsieur, le silence sera de votre part la
meilleure des excuses. Quant à moi, je vous promets le plus entier
oubli, pardon que vous méritez à peine.
--Madame, dit vivement Eugène, le pardon est inutile là où il n'y a pas
eu d'offense. La lettre, ajouta-t-il à voix basse, que vous avez reçue
et qui a dû vous paraître si inconvenante, ne vous était pas destinée.
La marquise ne put s'empêcher de sourire, elle voulait avoir été
offensée.
--Pourquoi mentir? reprit-elle d'un air dédaigneusement enjoué, mais
d'un son de voix assez doux. Maintenant que je vous ai grondé, je rirai
volontiers d'un stratagème qui n'est pas sans malice. Je connais de
pauvres femmes qui s'y prendraient.--Dieu! comme il aime!
diraient-elles. La marquise se mit à rire forcément, et ajouta d'un air
d'indulgence:--Si nous voulons rester amis, qu'il ne soit plus question
de méprises dont je ne puis être la dupe.
--Sur mon honneur, madame, vous l'êtes beaucoup plus que vous ne pensez,
répliqua vivement Eugène.
--Mais de quoi parlez-vous donc là? demanda monsieur de Listomère qui
depuis un instant écoutait la conversation sans en pouvoir percer
l'obscurité.
--Oh! cela n'est pas intéressant pour vous, répondit la marquise.
Monsieur de Listomère reprit tranquillement la lecture de son journal et
dit:--Ah! madame de Mortsauf est morte: votre pauvre frère est sans
doute à Clochegourde.
--Savez-vous, monsieur, reprit la marquise en se tournant vers Eugène,
que vous venez de dire une impertinence?
--Si je ne connaissais pas la rigueur de vos principes, répondit-il
naïvement, je croirais que vous voulez ou me donner des idées desquelles
je me défends, ou m'arracher mon secret. Peut-être encore voulez-vous
vous amuser de moi.
La marquise sourit. Ce sourire impatienta Eugène.
--Puissiez-vous, madame, dit-il, toujours croire à une offense que je
n'ai point commise! et je souhaite bien ardemment que le hasard ne vous
fasse pas découvrir dans le monde la personne qui devait lire cette
lettre...
--Hé quoi! ce serait toujours madame de Nucingen? s'écria madame de
Listomère plus curieuse de pénétrer un secret que de se venger des
épigrammes du jeune homme.
Eugène rougit. Il faut avoir plus de vingt-cinq ans pour ne pas rougir
en se voyant reprocher la bêtise d'une fidélité que les femmes raillent
pour ne pas montrer combien elles en sont envieuses. Néanmoins il dit
avec assez de sang-froid:--Pourquoi pas, madame?
Voilà les fautes que l'on commet à vingt-cinq ans. Cette confidence
causa une commotion violente à madame de Listomère; mais Eugène ne
savait pas encore analyser un visage de femme en le regardant à la hâte
ou de côté. Les lèvres seules de la marquise avaient pâli. Madame de
Listomère sonna pour demander du bois, et contraignit ainsi Rastignac à
se lever pour sortir.
--Si cela est, dit alors la marquise en arrêtant Eugène par un air froid
et composé, il vous serait difficile de m'expliquer, monsieur, par quel
hasard mon nom a pu se trouver sous votre plume. Il n'en est pas d'une
adresse écrite sur une lettre comme du claque d'un voisin qu'on peut par
étourderie prendre pour le sien en quittant le bal.
Eugène décontenancé regarda la marquise d'un air à la fois fat et bête,
il sentit qu'il devenait ridicule, balbutia une phrase d'écolier et
sortit. Quelques jours après la marquise acquit des preuves irrécusables
de la véracité d'Eugène. Depuis seize jours elle ne va plus dans le
monde.
Le marquis dit à tous ceux qui lui demandent raison de ce
changement:--Ma femme a une gastrite.
Moi qui la soigne et qui connais son secret, je sais qu'elle a seulement
une petite crise nerveuse de laquelle elle profite pour rester chez
elle.
  Paris, février 1830.
ALBERT SAVARUS
  DÉDIÉ A MADAME ÉMILE DE GIRARDIN,
  _Comme un témoignage d'affectueuse admiration_,
  DE BALZAC.
Un des quelques salons où se produisait l'archevêque de Besançon sous la
Restauration, et celui qu'il affectionnait était celui de madame la
baronne de Watteville. Un mot sur cette dame, le personnage féminin le
plus considérable peut-être de Besançon.
Monsieur de Watteville, petit-neveu du fameux Watteville, le plus
heureux et le plus illustre des meurtriers et des renégats dont les
aventures extraordinaires sont beaucoup trop historiques pour être
racontées, était aussi tranquille que son grand-oncle fut turbulent.
Après avoir vécu dans la Comté comme un cloporte dans la fente d'une
boiserie, il avait épousé l'héritière de la célèbre famille de Rupt.
Mademoiselle de Rupt réunit vingt mille francs de rentes en terre aux
dix mille francs de rentes en biens-fonds du baron de Watteville.
L'écusson du gentilhomme suisse, les Watteville sont de Suisse, fut mis
en abîme sur le vieil écusson des de Rupt. Ce mariage, décidé depuis
1802, se fit en 1815, après la seconde restauration. Trois ans après la
naissance d'une fille qui fut nommée Philomène, tous les grands parents
de madame de Watteville étaient morts et leurs successions liquidées.
On vendit alors la maison de monsieur de Watteville pour s'établir rue
de la Préfecture, dans le bel hôtel de Rupt dont le vaste jardin s'étend
vers la rue du Perron. Madame de Watteville, jeune fille dévote, fut
encore plus dévote après son mariage. Elle est une des reines de la
sainte confrérie qui donne à la haute société de Besançon un air sombre
et des façons prudes en harmonie avec le caractère de cette ville. De là
le nom de Philomène imposé à sa fille, née en 1817, au moment où le
culte de cette sainte ou de ce saint, car dans les commencements on ne
savait à quel sexe appartenait ce squelette, devenait une sorte de folie
religieuse en Italie, et un étendard pour l'Ordre des Jésuites.
Monsieur le baron de Watteville, homme sec, maigre et sans esprit,
paraissait usé, sans qu'on pût savoir à quoi, car il jouissait d'une
ignorance crasse; mais comme sa femme était d'un blond ardent et d'une
nature sèche devenue proverbiale (on dit encore pointue comme madame de
Watteville), quelques plaisants de la magistrature prétendaient que le
baron s'était usé contre cette roche. Rupt vient évidemment de _rupes_.
Les savants observateurs de la nature sociale ne manqueront pas de
remarquer que Philomène fut l'unique fruit du mariage des Watteville et
des Rupt.
Monsieur de Watteville passait sa vie dans un riche atelier de tourneur,
il tournait! Comme complément à cette existence, il s'était donné la
fantaisie des collections. Pour les médecins philosophes adonnés à
l'étude de la folie, cette tendance à collectionner est un premier degré
d'aliénation mentale, quand elle se porte sur les petites choses. Le
baron de Watteville amassait les coquillages, les insectes et les
fragments géologiques du territoire de Besançon. Quelques
contradicteurs, des femmes surtout, disaient de monsieur de
Watteville:--Il a une belle âme! il a vu, dès le début de son mariage,
qu'il ne l'emporterait pas sur sa femme, il s'est alors jeté dans une
occupation mécanique et dans la bonne chère.
L'hôtel de Rupt ne manquait pas d'une certaine splendeur digne de celle
de Louis XIV, et se ressentait de la noblesse des deux familles,
confondues en 1815. Il y brillait un vieux luxe qui ne se savait pas de
mode. Les lustres de vieux cristaux taillés en forme de feuilles, les
lampasses, les damas, les tapis, les meubles dorés, tout était en
harmonie avec les vieilles livrées et les vieux domestiques. Quoique
servie dans une noire argenterie de famille, autour d'un surtout en
glace orné de porcelaines de Saxe, la chère y était exquise. Les vins
choisis par monsieur de Watteville, qui, pour occuper sa vie et y mettre
de la diversité, s'était fait son propre sommelier, jouissaient d'une
sorte de célébrité départementale. La fortune de madame de Watteville
était considérable, car celle de son mari, qui consistait dans la terre
de Rouxey valant environ dix mille livres de rente, ne s'augmenta
d'aucun héritage. Il est inutile de faire observer que la liaison
très-intime de madame de Watteville avec l'archevêque avait impatronisé
chez elle les trois ou quatre abbés remarquables et spirituels de
l'archevêché qui ne haïssaient point la table.
Dans un dîner d'apparat, rendu pour je ne sais quelle noce au
commencement du mois de septembre 1834, au moment où les femmes étaient
rangées en cercle devant la cheminée du salon et les hommes en groupes
aux croisées, il se fit une acclamation à la vue de monsieur l'abbé de
Grancey, qu'on annonça.
--Eh bien! le procès? lui cria-t-on.
--Gagné! répondit le vicaire-général. L'arrêt de la Cour, de laquelle
nous désespérions, vous saviez pourquoi...
Ceci était une allusion à la composition de la Cour royale depuis 1830.
Les légitimistes avaient presque tous donné leur démission.
--... L'arrêt vient de nous donner gain de cause sur tous les points, et
réforme le jugement de première instance.
--Tout le monde vous croyait perdus.
--Et nous l'étions sans moi. J'ai dit à notre avocat de s'en aller à
Paris, et j'ai pu prendre, au moment de la bataille, un nouvel avocat à
qui nous devons le gain du procès, un homme extraordinaire...
--A Besançon? dit naïvement monsieur de Watteville.
--A Besançon, répondit l'abbé de Grancey.
--Ah! oui, Savaron, dit un beau jeune homme assis près de la baronne et
nommé de Soulas.
--Il a passé cinq ou six nuits, il a dévoré les liasses; les dossiers,
il a eu sept à huit conférences de plusieurs heures avec moi, reprit
monsieur de Grancey qui reparaissait à l'hôtel de Rupt pour la première
fois depuis vingt jours. Enfin, monsieur Savaron vient de battre
complétement le célèbre avocat que nos adversaires étaient allés
chercher à Paris. Ce jeune homme a été merveilleux, au dire des
Conseillers. Ainsi, le Chapitre est deux fois vainqueur: il a vaincu en
Droit, puis en Politique il a vaincu le libéralisme dans la personne du
défenseur de notre hôtel de ville. «Nos adversaires, a dit notre avocat,
ne doivent pas s'attendre à trouver partout de la complaisance pour
ruiner les archevêchés...» Le président a été forcé de faire faire
silence. Tous les Bisontins ont applaudi. Ainsi la propriété des
bâtiments de l'ancien couvent reste au Chapitre de la cathédrale de
Besançon. Monsieur Savaron a d'ailleurs invité son confrère de Paris à
dîner au sortir du palais. En acceptant, celui-ci lui a dit: «A tout
vainqueur tout honneur!» et l'a félicité sans rancune sur son triomphe.
--Où donc avez-vous déniché cet avocat? dit madame de Watteville. Je
n'ai jamais entendu prononcer ce nom-là.
--Mais vous pouvez voir ses fenêtres d'ici, répondit le vicaire-général.
Monsieur Savaron demeure rue du Perron, le jardin de sa maison est mur
mitoyen avec le vôtre.
--Il n'est pas de la Comté, dit monsieur de Watteville.
--Il est si peu de quelque part, qu'on ne sait pas d'où il est, dit
madame de Chavoncourt.
--Mais qu'est-il? demanda madame de Watteville en prenant le bras de
monsieur de Soulas pour se rendre à la salle à manger. S'il est
étranger, par quel hasard est-il venu s'établir à Besançon? C'est une
idée bien singulière pour un avocat.
--Bien singulière! répéta le jeune Amédée de Soulas dont la biographie
devient nécessaire à l'intelligence de cette histoire.
De tout temps, la France et l'Angleterre ont fait un échange de
futilités d'autant plus suivi, qu'il échappe à la tyrannie des douanes.
La mode que nous appelons anglaise à Paris se nomme française à Londres,
et réciproquement. L'inimitié des deux peuples cesse en deux points, sur
la question des mots et sur celle du vêtement. _God save the King_,
l'air national de l'Angleterre, est une musique faite par Lulli pour les
choeurs d'Esther ou d'Athalie. Les paniers apportés par une Anglaise à
Paris furent inventés à Londres, on sait pourquoi, par une Française, la
fameuse duchesse de Portsmouth; on commença par s'en moquer si bien que
la première Anglaise qui parut aux Tuileries faillit être écrasée par la
foule; mais ils furent adoptés. Cette mode a tyrannisé les femmes de
l'Europe pendant un demi-siècle. A la paix de 1815, on plaisanta durant
une année les tailles longues des Anglaises, tout Paris alla voir
Pothier et Brunet dans les _Anglaises pour rire_; mais, en 1816 et 17,
les ceintures des Françaises, qui leur coupaient le sein en 1814,
descendirent par degrés jusqu'à leur dessiner les hanches. Depuis dix
ans, l'Angleterre nous a fait deux petits cadeaux linguistiques. A
l'_incroyable_, au _merveilleux_, à l'_élégant_, ces trois héritiers des
_petits-maîtres_ dont l'étymologie est assez indécente, ont succédé le
_dandy_, puis le _lion_. Le _lion_ n'a pas engendré la _lionne_. La
lionne est due à la fameuse chanson d'Alfred de Musset: _Avez-vous vu
dans Barcelone... C'est ma maîtresse et ma lionne_: il y a eu fusion, ou
si vous voulez, confusion entre les deux termes et les deux idées
dominantes. Quand une bêtise amuse Paris, qui dévore autant de
chefs-d'oeuvre que de bêtises, il est difficile que la province s'en
prive. Aussi, dès que le _lion_ promena dans Paris sa crinière, sa barbe
et ses moustaches, ses gilets et son lorgnon tenu sans le secours des
mains, par la contraction de la joue et de l'arcade sourcilière, les
capitales de quelques départements ont-elles vu des sous-lions qui
protestèrent, par l'élégance de leurs sous-pieds, contre l'incurie de
leurs compatriotes. Donc Besançon jouissait, en 1834, d'un lion dans la
personne de ce monsieur Amédée-Sylvain-Jacques de Soulas, écrit Souleyas
au temps de l'occupation espagnole. Amédée de Soulas est peut-être le
seul qui, dans Besançon, descende d'une famille espagnole. L'Espagne
envoyait des gens faire ses affaires dans la _Comté_, mais il s'y
établissait fort peu d'Espagnols. Les Soulas y restèrent à cause de leur
alliance avec le cardinal Granvelle. Le jeune monsieur de Soulas parlait
toujours de quitter Besançon, ville triste, dévote, peu littéraire,
ville de guerre et de garnison, dont les moeurs et l'allure, dont la
physionomie valent la peine d'être dépeintes. Cette opinion lui
permettait de se loger, en homme incertain de son avenir, dans trois
chambres très-peu meublées au bout de la rue Neuve à l'endroit où elle
se rencontre avec la rue de la Préfecture.
Le jeune monsieur de Soulas ne pouvait se dispenser d'avoir un tigre. Ce
tigre était le fils d'un de ses fermiers, un petit domestique âgé de
quatorze ans, trapu, nommé Babylas. Le lion avait très-bien habillé son
tigre: redingote courte en drap gris de fer, serrée par une ceinture de
cuir verni, culotte de panne gros-bleu, gilet rouge, bottes vernies et à
revers, chapeau rond à bourdaloue noir, des boutons jaunes aux armes des
Soulas. Amédée donnait à ce garçon des gants de coton blanc, le
blanchissage et trente-six francs par mois, à la charge de se nourrir,
ce qui paraissait monstrueux aux grisettes de Besançon: quatre cent
vingt francs à un enfant de quinze ans, sans compter les cadeaux! Les
cadeaux consistaient dans la vente des habits réformés, dans un
pourboire quand Soulas troquait l'un de ses deux chevaux, et la vente
des fumiers. Les deux chevaux, administrés avec une sordide économie,
coûtaient l'un dans l'autre huit cents francs par an. Le compte des
fournitures à Paris en parfumeries, cravates, bijouterie, pots de
vernis, habits, allait à douze cents francs. Si vous additionnez groom
ou tigre, chevaux, tenue superlative, et loyer de six cents francs, vous
trouverez un total de trois mille francs. Or, le père du jeune monsieur
de Soulas ne lui avait pas laissé plus de quatre mille francs de rentes
produits par quelques métairies assez chétives qui exigeaient de
l'entretien, et dont l'entretien imprimait une certaine incertitude aux
revenus. A peine restait-il trois francs par jour au lion pour sa vie,
sa poche et son jeu. Aussi dînait-il souvent en ville, et déjeunait-il
avec une frugalité remarquable. Quand il fallait absolument dîner à ses
frais, il allait à la pension des officiers. Le jeune monsieur de Soulas
passait pour un dissipateur, pour un homme qui faisait des folies;
tandis que le malheureux nouait les deux bouts de l'année avec une
astuce, avec un talent qui eussent fait la gloire d'une bonne ménagère.
On ignorait encore, à Besançon surtout, combien six francs de vernis
étalé sur des bottes ou sur des souliers, des gants jaunes de cinquante
sous nettoyés dans le plus profond secret pour les faire servir trois
fois, des cravates de dix francs qui durent trois mois, quatre gilets de
vingt-cinq francs et des pantalons qui emboîtent la botte imposent à une
capitale! Comment en serait-il autrement, puisque nous voyons à Paris
des femmes accordant une attention particulière à des sots qui viennent
chez elles et l'emportent sur les hommes les plus remarquables, à cause
de ces frivoles avantages qu'on peut se procurer pour quinze louis, y
compris la frisure et une chemise de toile de Hollande?
Si cet infortuné jeune homme vous paraît être devenu lion à bien bon
marché, apprenez qu'Amédée de Soulas était allé trois fois en Suisse, en
char et à petites journées; deux fois à Paris, et une fois de Paris en
Angleterre. Il passait pour un voyageur instruit et pouvait dire: _En
Angleterre, où je suis allé_, etc. Les douairières lui disaient: _Vous
qui êtes allé en Angleterre_, etc. Il avait poussé jusqu'en Lombardie,
il avait côtoyé les lacs d'Italie. Il lisait les ouvrages nouveaux.
Enfin, pendant qu'il nettoyait ses gants, le tigre Babylas répondait aux
visiteurs:--Monsieur travaille. Aussi avait-on essayé de démonétiser le
jeune monsieur Amédée de Soulas à l'aide de ce mot:--C'est un _homme
très-avancé_. Amédée possédait le talent de débiter avec la gravité
bisontine les lieux communs à la mode, ce qui lui donnait le mérite
d'être un des hommes les plus éclairés de la noblesse. Il portait sur
lui la bijouterie à la mode, et dans sa tête les pensées contrôlées par
la Presse.
En 1834, Amédée était un jeune homme de vingt-cinq ans, de taille
moyenne, brun, le thorax violemment prononcé, les épaules à l'avenant,
les cuisses un peu rondes, le pied déjà gras, la main blanche et
potelée, un collier de barbe, des moustaches qui rivalisaient celles de
la garnison, une bonne grosse figure rougeaude, le nez écrasé, les yeux
bruns et sans expression; d'ailleurs rien d'espagnol. Il marchait à
grands pas vers une obésité fatale à ses prétentions. Ses ongles étaient
soignés, sa barbe était faite, les moindres détails de son vêtement
étaient tenus avec une exactitude anglaise. Aussi regardait-on Amédée de
Soulas comme le plus bel homme de Besançon. Un coiffeur, qui venait le
coiffer à heure fixe (autre luxe de soixante francs par an!), le
préconisait comme l'arbitre souverain en fait de modes et d'élégance.
Amédée dormait tard, faisait sa toilette, et sortait à cheval vers midi
pour aller dans une de ses métairies tirer le pistolet. Il mettait à
cette occupation la même importance qu'y mit lord Byron dans ses
derniers jours. Puis, il revenait à trois heures, admiré sur son cheval
par les grisettes et par les personnes qui se trouvaient à leurs
croisées. Après de prétendus travaux qui paraissaient l'occuper jusqu'à
quatre heures, il s'habillait pour aller dîner en ville, et passait la
soirée dans les salons de l'aristocratie bisontine à jouer au whist, et
revenait se coucher à onze heures. Aucune existence ne pouvait être plus
à jour, plus sage, ni plus irréprochable, car il allait exactement aux
offices le dimanche et les fêtes.
Pour vous faire comprendre combien cette vie est exorbitante, il est
nécessaire d'expliquer Besançon en quelques mots. Nulle ville n'offre
une résistance plus sourde et muette au Progrès. A Besançon, les
administrateurs, les employés, les militaires, enfin tous ceux que le
gouvernement, que Paris y envoie occuper un poste quelconque, sont
désignés en bloc sous le nom expressif de _la colonie_. La Colonie est
le terrain neutre, le seul où, comme à l'église, peuvent se rencontrer
la société noble et la société bourgeoise de la ville. Sur ce terrain
commencent, à propos d'un mot, d'un regard ou d'un geste, des haines de
maison à maison, entre femmes bourgeoises et nobles, qui durent jusqu'à
la mort, et agrandissent encore les fossés infranchissables par
lesquels les deux sociétés sont séparées. A l'exception des
Clermont-Mont-Saint-Jean, des Beauffremont, des de Scey, des Gramont et
de quelques autres qui n'habitent la Comté que dans leurs terres, la
noblesse bisontine ne remonte pas à plus de deux siècles, à l'époque de
la conquête par Louis XIV. Ce monde est essentiellement parlementaire et
d'un rogue, d'un raide, d'un grave, d'un positif, d'une hauteur qui ne
peut pas se comparer à la cour de Vienne, car les Bisontins feraient en
ceci les salons viennois quinaulds. De Victor Hugo, de Nodier, de
Fourier, les gloires de la ville, il n'en est pas question, on ne s'en
occupe pas. Les mariages entre nobles s'arrangent dès le berceau des
enfants, tant les moindres choses comme les plus graves y sont définies.
Jamais un étranger, un intrus ne s'est glissé dans ces maisons, et il a
fallu, pour y faire recevoir des colonels ou des officiers titrés
appartenant aux meilleures familles de France, quand il s'en trouvait
dans la garnison, des efforts de diplomatie que le prince de Talleyrand
eût été fort heureux de connaître pour s'en servir dans un congrès. En
1834, Amédée était le seul qui portât des sous-pieds à Besançon. Ceci
vous explique déjà la _lionnerie_ du jeune monsieur de Soulas. Enfin une
petite anecdote vous fera bien comprendre Besançon.
Quelque temps avant le jour où cette histoire commence, la Préfecture
éprouva le besoin de faire venir de Paris un rédacteur pour son journal,
afin de se défendre contre la petite _Gazette_ que la grande Gazette
avait pondue à Besançon, et contre _le Patriote_ que la République y
faisait frétiller. Paris envoya un jeune homme, ignorant sa Comté, qui
débuta par un _premier-Besançon_ de l'école du Charivari. Le chef du
parti juste-milieu, un homme de l'Hôtel-de-Ville, fit venir le
journaliste, et lui dit:--Apprenez, monsieur, que nous sommes graves,
plus que graves, ennuyeux, nous ne voulons point qu'on nous amuse, et
nous sommes furieux d'avoir ri. Soyez aussi dur à digérer que les plus
épaisses amplifications de la Revue des deux Mondes, et vous serez à
peine au ton des Bisontins.
Le rédacteur se le tint pour dit, et parla le patois philosophique le
plus difficile à comprendre. Il eut un succès complet.
Si le jeune monsieur de Soulas ne perdit pas dans l'estime des salons de
Besançon, ce fut pure vanité de leur part: l'aristocratie était bien
aise d'avoir l'air de se moderniser et de pouvoir offrir aux nobles
Parisiens en voyage dans la Comté un jeune homme qui leur ressemblait à
peu près. Tout ce travail caché, toute cette poudre jetée aux yeux,
cette folie apparente, cette sagesse latente avaient un but, sans quoi
le lion bisontin n'eût pas été du pays. Amédée voulait arriver à un
mariage avantageux en prouvant un jour que ses fermes n'étaient pas
hypothéquées, et qu'il avait fait des économies. Il voulait occuper la
ville, il voulait en être le plus bel homme, le plus élégant, pour
obtenir d'abord l'attention, puis la main de mademoiselle Philomène de
Watteville: ah!
En 1830, au moment où le jeune monsieur de Soulas commença son métier de
dandy, Philomène avait treize ans. En 1834, mademoiselle de Watteville
atteignait donc à cet âge où les jeunes personnes sont facilement
frappées par toutes les singularités qui recommandaient Amédée à
l'attention de la ville. Il y a beaucoup de lions qui se font lions par
calcul et par spéculation. Les Watteville, riches depuis douze ans de
cinquante mille francs de rentes, ne dépensaient pas plus de
vingt-quatre mille francs par an, tout en recevant la haute société de
Besançon, les lundis et les vendredis. On y dînait le lundi, l'on y
passait la soirée le vendredi. Ainsi, depuis douze ans, quelle somme ne
faisaient pas vingt-six mille francs annuellement économisés et placés
avec la discrétion qui distingue ces vieilles familles? On croyait assez
généralement que se trouvant assez riche en terres, madame de Watteville
avait mis dans le trois pour cent ses économies en 1830. La dot de
Philomène devait alors se composer d'environ quarante mille francs de
rentes. Depuis cinq ans, le lion avait donc travaillé comme une taupe
pour se loger dans le haut bout de l'estime de la sévère baronne, tout
en se posant de manière à flatter l'amour-propre de mademoiselle de
Watteville. La baronne était dans le secret des inventions par
lesquelles Amédée parvenait à soutenir son rang dans Besançon, et l'en
estimait fort. Soulas s'était mis sous l'aile de la baronne quand elle
avait trente ans, il eut alors l'audace de l'admirer et d'en faire une
idole; il en était arrivé à pouvoir lui raconter, lui seul au monde, les
gaudrioles que presque toutes les dévotes aiment à entendre dire,
autorisées qu'elles sont par leurs grandes vertus à contempler des
abîmes sans y choir et les embûches du démon sans s'y prendre.
Comprenez-vous pourquoi ce lion ne se permettait pas la plus légère
intrigue? il clarifiait sa vie, il vivait en quelque sorte dans la rue
afin de pouvoir jouer le rôle d'amant sacrifié près de la baronne, et
lui régaler l'Esprit des péchés qu'elle interdisait à sa Chair. Un homme
qui possède le privilége de couler des choses lestes dans l'oreille
d'une dévote, est à ses yeux un homme charmant. Si ce lion exemplaire
eût mieux connu le coeur humain, il aurait pu sans danger se permettre
quelques amourettes parmi les grisettes de Besançon qui le regardaient
comme un roi: ses affaires se seraient avancées auprès de la sévère et
prude baronne. Avec Philomène, ce caton paraissait dépensier: il
professait la vie élégante, il lui montrait en perspective le rôle
brillant d'une femme à la mode à Paris, où il irait comme député. Ces
savantes manoeuvres furent couronnées par un plein succès. En 1834, les
mères des quarante familles nobles qui composent la haute société
bisontine, citaient le jeune monsieur Amédée de Soulas, comme le plus
charmant jeune homme de Besançon, personne n'osait disputer la place au
coq de l'hôtel de Rupt, et tout Besançon le regardait comme le futur
époux de Philomène de Watteville. Il y avait eu déjà même à ce sujet
quelques paroles échangées entre la baronne et Amédée, auxquelles la
prétendue nullité du baron donnait une certitude.
Mademoiselle Philomène de Watteville à qui sa fortune, énorme un jour,
prêtait alors des proportions considérables, élevée dans l'enceinte de
l'hôtel de Rupt que sa mère quitta rarement, tant elle aimait le cher
archevêque, avait été fortement comprimée par une éducation
exclusivement religieuse, et par le despotisme de sa mère qui la
_tenait_ sévèrement par principes. Philomène ne savait absolument rien.
Est-ce savoir quelque chose que d'avoir étudié la géographie dans
Guthrie, l'histoire sainte, l'histoire ancienne, l'histoire de France,
et les quatre règles, le tout passé au tamis d'un vieux jésuite? Dessin,
musique et danse furent interdits, comme plus propres à corrompre qu'à
embellir la vie. La baronne apprit à sa fille tous les points possibles
de la tapisserie et les petits ouvrages de femme: la couture, la
broderie, le filet. A dix-sept ans Philomène n'avait lu que les Lettres
Édifiantes, et des ouvrages sur la science héraldique. Jamais un
journal n'avait souillé ses regards. Elle entendait tous les matins la
messe à la cathédrale où la menait sa mère, revenait déjeuner,
travaillait après une petite promenade dans le jardin, et recevait les
visites assise près de la baronne jusqu'à l'heure du dîner; puis après,
excepté les lundis et les vendredis, elle accompagnait madame de
Watteville dans les soirées, sans pouvoir y parler plus que ne le
voulait l'ordonnance maternelle.
A dix-sept ans, mademoiselle de Watteville était une jeune fille frêle,
mince, plate, blonde, blanche, et de la dernière insignifiance. Ses
yeux, d'un bleu pâle, s'embellissaient par le jeu des paupières qui,
baissées, produisaient une ombre sur ses joues. Quelques taches de
rousseur nuisaient à l'éclat de son front, d'ailleurs bien coupé. Son
visage ressemblait parfaitement à ceux des saintes d'Albert Dürer et des
peintres antérieurs au Pérugin: même forme grasse, quoique mince, même
délicatesse attristée par l'extase, même naïveté sévère. Tout en elle,
jusqu'à sa pose rappelait ces vierges dont la beauté ne reparaît dans
son lustre mystique qu'aux yeux d'un connaisseur attentif. Elle avait de
belles mains, mais rouges, et le plus joli pied, un pied de châtelaine.
Habituellement, elle portait des robes de simple cotonnade; mais le
dimanche et les jours de fête sa mère lui permettait la soie. Ses modes
faites à Besançon, la rendaient presque laide; tandis que sa mère
essayait d'emprunter de la grâce, de la beauté, de l'élégance aux modes
de Paris d'où elle tirait les plus petites choses de sa toilette, par
les soins du jeune monsieur de Soulas. Philomène n'avait jamais porté de
bas de soie, ni de brodequins, mais des bas de coton et des souliers de
peau. Les jours de gala, elle était vêtue d'une robe de mousseline,
coiffée en cheveux, et avait des souliers en peau bronzée.
Cette éducation et l'attitude modeste de Philomène cachaient un
caractère de fer. Les physiologistes et les profonds observateurs de la
nature humaine vous diront, à votre grand étonnement peut-être, que,
dans les familles, les humeurs, les caractères, l'esprit, le génie
reparaissent à de grands intervalles absolument comme ce qu'on appelle
les maladies héréditaires. Ainsi le talent, de même que la goutte, saute
quelquefois de deux générations. Nous avons, de ce phénomène, un
illustre exemple dans George Sand en qui revivent la force, la puissance
et le concept du maréchal de Saxe, de qui elle est petite-fille
naturelle. Le caractère décisif, la romanesque audace du fameux
Watteville étaient revenus dans l'âme de sa petite-nièce, encore
aggravés par la ténacité, par la fierté du sang des de Rupt. Mais ces
qualités ou ces défauts, si vous voulez, étaient aussi profondément
cachés dans cette âme de jeune fille, en apparence molle et débile, que
les laves bouillantes le sont sous une colline avant qu'elle ne devienne
un volcan. Madame de Watteville seule soupçonnait peut-être ce legs des
deux sangs. Elle se faisait si sévère pour sa Philomène, qu'elle
répondit un jour à l'archevêque qui lui reprochait de la traiter trop
durement:--Laissez-moi la conduire, monseigneur, je la connais! elle a
plus d'un Belzébuth dans sa peau!
La baronne observait d'autant mieux sa fille, qu'elle y croyait son
honneur de mère engagé. Enfin elle n'avait pas autre chose à faire.
Clotilde de Rupt, alors âgée de trente-cinq ans et presque veuve d'un
époux qui tournait des coquetiers en toute espèce de bois, qui
s'acharnait à faire des cercles à six raies en bois de fer, qui
fabriquait des tabatières pour sa société, coquetait en tout bien tout
honneur avec Amédée de Soulas. Quand ce jeune homme était au logis, elle
renvoyait et rappelait tour à tour sa fille, et tâchait de surprendre
dans cette jeune âme des mouvements de jalousie, afin d'avoir l'occasion
de les dompter. Elle imitait la police dans ses rapports avec les
républicains; mais elle avait beau faire, Philomène ne se livrait à
aucune espèce d'émeute. La sèche dévote reprochait alors à sa fille sa
parfaite insensibilité. Philomène connaissait assez sa mère pour savoir
que si elle eût trouvé _bien_ le jeune monsieur de Soulas, elle se
serait attiré quelque verte remontrance. Aussi à toutes les agaceries de
sa mère, répondait-elle par ces phrases si improprement appelées
jésuitiques, car les jésuites étaient forts, et ces réticences sont les
chevaux de frise derrière lesquels s'abrite la faiblesse. La mère
traitait alors sa fille de dissimulée. Si, par malheur, un éclat du vrai
caractère des Watteville et des de Rupt se faisait jour, la mère
rebattait Philomène avec le fer du respect sur l'enclume de l'obéissance
passive. Ce combat secret avait lieu dans l'enceinte la plus secrète de
la vie domestique, à huis clos. Le vicaire-général, ce cher abbé de
Grancey, l'ami du défunt archevêque, quelque fort qu'il fût en sa
qualité de grand-pénitencier du diocèse, ne pouvait pas deviner si cette
lutte avait ému quelque haine entre la mère et la fille, si la mère
était par avance jalouse, ou si la cour que faisait Amédée à la fille
dans la personne de la mère n'avait pas outrepassé les bornes. En sa
qualité d'ami de la maison, il ne confessait ni la mère ni la fille.
Philomène, un peu trop battue, moralement parlant, à propos du jeune
monsieur de Soulas, ne pouvait pas le souffrir, pour employer un terme
du langage familier. Aussi quand il lui adressait la parole en tâchant
de surprendre son coeur, le recevait-elle assez froidement. Cette
répugnance, visible seulement aux yeux de sa mère, était un continuel
sujet d'admonestation.
--Philomène, je ne vois pas pourquoi vous affectez tant de froideur pour
Amédée, est-ce parce qu'il est l'ami de la maison, et qu'il nous plaît,
_à votre père_ et à moi...
--Eh! maman, répondit un jour la pauvre enfant, si je l'accueillais
bien, n'aurais-je pas plus de torts?
--Qu'est-ce que cela signifie? s'écria madame de Watteville.
Qu'entendez-vous par ces paroles? votre mère est injuste, peut-être, et
selon vous, elle le serait dans tous les cas? Que jamais il ne sorte
plus de pareille réponse de votre bouche, à votre mère!... etc.
Cette querelle dura trois heures trois quarts, et Philomène en fit
l'observation. La mère devint pâle de colère, et renvoya sa fille dans
sa chambre où Philomène étudia le sens de cette scène, sans y rien
trouver, tant elle était innocente! Ainsi, le jeune monsieur de Soulas,
que toute la ville de Besançon croyait bien près du but vers lequel il
tendait, cravates déployées, à coups de pots de vernis, et qui lui
faisait user tant de noir à cirer les moustaches, tant de jolis gilets,
de fers de chevaux et de corsets, car il portait un gilet de peau, le
corset des lions; Amédée en était plus loin que le premier venu,
quoiqu'il eût pour lui le digne et noble abbé de Grancey. Philomène ne
savait pas d'ailleurs encore, au moment où cette histoire commence, que
le jeune comte Amédée de Souleyaz lui fût destiné.
--Madame, dit monsieur de Soulas en s'adressant à la baronne en
attendant que le potage un peu trop chaud se fût refroidi et en
affectant de rendre son récit quasi romanesque, un beau matin la
malle-poste a jeté dans l'Hôtel National un Parisien qui, après avoir
cherché des appartements, s'est décidé pour le premier étage de la
maison de mademoiselle Galard, rue du Perron. Puis, l'_étranger_ est
allé droit à la mairie y déposer une déclaration de domicile réel et
politique. Enfin il s'est fait inscrire au tableau des avocats près la
cour en présentant des titres en règle, et il a mis des cartes chez tous
ses nouveaux confrères, chez les officiers ministériels, chez les
Conseillers de la cour et chez tous les membres du tribunal, une carte
où se lisait: ALBERT SAVARON.
--Le nom de Savaron est célèbre, dit mademoiselle Philomène, qui était
très-forte en science héraldique. Les Savaron de Savarus sont une des
plus vieilles, des plus nobles et des plus riches familles de Belgique.
--Il est Français et troubadour, reprit Amédée de Soulas. S'il veut
prendre les armes des Savaron de Savarus, il y mettra une barre. Il n'y
a plus en Brabant qu'une demoiselle Savarus, une riche héritière à
marier.
--La barre est signe de bâtardise; mais le bâtard d'un comte de Savarus
est noble, reprit Philomène.
--Assez, Philomène! dit la baronne.
--Vous avez voulu qu'elle sût le blason, fit monsieur de Watteville,
elle le sait bien!
--Continuez, Amédée.
--Vous comprenez que dans une ville où tout est classé, défini, connu,
casé, chiffré, numéroté comme à Besançon, Albert Savaron a été reçu par
nos avocats sans aucune difficulté. Chacun s'est contenté de dire: Voilà
un pauvre diable qui ne sait pas son Besançon. Qui diable a pu lui
conseiller de venir ici? qu'y prétend-il faire? Envoyer sa carte chez
les magistrats au lieu d'y aller en personne?... quelle faute! Aussi,
trois jours après, plus de Savaron. Il a pris pour domestique l'ancien
valet de chambre de feu monsieur Galard, Jérôme qui sait faire un peu de
cuisine. On a d'autant mieux oublié Albert Savaron que personne ne l'a
ni vu ni rencontré.
--Il ne va donc pas à la messe? dit madame de Chavoncourt.
--Il y va le dimanche, à Saint-Jean, mais à la première messe, à huit
heures. Il se lève toutes les nuits entre une heure et deux du matin, il
travaille jusqu'à huit heures, il déjeune, et après il travaille encore.
Il se promène dans le jardin, il en fait cinquante fois, soixante fois
le tour; il rentre, dîne, et se couche entre six et sept heures.
--Comment savez-vous tout cela? dit madame de Chavoncourt à monsieur de
Soulas.
--D'abord, madame, je demeure rue Neuve au coin de la rue du Perron,
j'ai vue sur la maison où loge ce mystérieux personnage; puis il y a
mutuellement des protocoles entre mon tigre et Jérôme.
--Vous causez donc avec Babylas?
--Que voulez-vous que je fasse dans mes promenades?
--Eh! bien, comment avez-vous pris un étranger pour avocat? dit la
baronne en rendant ainsi la parole au vicaire-général.
--Le premier président a joué le tour à cet avocat de le nommer d'office
pour défendre aux assises un paysan à peu près imbécile, accusé de faux.
Monsieur Savaron a fait acquitter ce pauvre homme en prouvant son
innocence et démontrant qu'il avait été l'instrument des vrais
coupables. Non-seulement son système a triomphé, mais il a nécessité
l'arrestation de deux des témoins qui, reconnus coupables, ont été
condamnés. Ses plaidoiries ont frappé la Cour et les jurés. L'un d'eux,
un négociant, a confié le lendemain à monsieur Savaron un procès
délicat, qu'il a gagné. Dans la situation où nous étions par
l'impossibilité où se trouvait monsieur Berryer de venir à Besançon,
monsieur de Garcenault nous a donné le conseil de prendre ce monsieur
Albert Savaron en nous prédisant le succès. Dès que je l'ai vu, que je
l'ai entendu, j'ai eu foi en lui, et je n'ai pas eu tort.
--A-t-il donc quelque chose d'extraordinaire, demanda madame de
Chavoncourt.
--Oui, répondit le vicaire-général.
--Eh! bien, expliquez-nous cela, dit madame de Watteville.
--La première fois que je le vis, dit l'abbé de Grancey, il me reçut
dans la première pièce après l'antichambre (l'ancien salon du bonhomme
Galard), qu'il a fait peindre en vieux chêne, et que j'ai trouvée
entièrement tapissée de livres de droit contenus dans des bibliothèques
également peintes en vieux bois. Cette peinture et les livres sont tout
le luxe, car le mobilier consiste en un bureau de vieux bois sculpté,
six vieux fauteuils en tapisserie, aux fenêtres des rideaux couleur
carmélite bordés de vert, et un tapis vert sur le plancher. Le poêle de
l'antichambre chauffe aussi cette bibliothèque. En l'attendant là, je ne
me figurais point mon avocat sous des traits jeunes. Ce singulier cadre
est vraiment en harmonie avec la figure, car monsieur Savaron est venu
en robe de chambre de mérinos noir, serrée par une ceinture en corde
rouge, des pantoufles rouges, un gilet de flanelle rouge, une calotte
rouge.
--La livrée du diable! s'écria madame de Watteville.
--Oui, dit l'abbé; mais une tête superbe: cheveux noirs, mélangés déjà
de quelques cheveux blancs, des cheveux comme en ont les saint Pierre et
les saint Paul de nos tableaux, à boucles touffues et luisantes, des
cheveux durs comme des crins, un cou blanc et rond comme celui d'une
femme, un front magnifique séparé par ce sillon puissant que les grands
projets, les grandes pensées, les fortes méditations inscrivent au front
des grands hommes; un teint olivâtre marbré de taches rouges, un nez
carré, des yeux de feu, puis les joues creusées, marquées de deux rides
longues pleines de souffrances, une bouche à sourire sarde et un petit
menton mince et trop court; la patte d'oie aux tempes, les yeux caves,
roulant sous des arcades sourcilières comme deux globes ardents; mais,
malgré tous ces indices de passions violentes, un air calme,
profondément résigné, la voix d'une douceur pénétrante, et qui m'a
surpris au Palais par sa facilité, la vraie voix de l'orateur tantôt
pure et rusée, tantôt insinuante, et tonnant quand il le faut, puis se
pliant au sarcasme et devenant alors incisive. Monsieur Albert Savaron
est de moyenne taille, ni gras ni maigre. Enfin il a des mains de
prélat. La seconde fois que je suis allé chez lui, il m'a reçu dans sa
chambre qui est contiguë à cette bibliothèque, et a souri de mon
étonnement quand j'y ai vu une méchante commode, un mauvais tapis, un
lit de collégien et aux fenêtres des rideaux de calicot. Il sortait de
son cabinet où personne ne pénètre, m'a dit Jérôme qui n'y entre pas et
qui s'est contenté de frapper à la porte. Monsieur Savaron a fermé
lui-même cette porte à clef devant moi. La troisième fois, il déjeunait
dans sa bibliothèque de la manière la plus frugale; mais cette fois,
comme il avait passé la nuit à examiner nos pièces, que j'étais avec
notre avoué, que nous devions rester longtemps ensemble et que le cher
monsieur Girardet est verbeux, j'ai pu me permettre d'étudier cet
étranger. Certes, ce n'est pas un homme ordinaire. Il y a plus d'un
secret derrière ce masque à la fois terrible et doux, patient et
impatient, plein et creusé. Je l'ai trouvé voûté légèrement, comme tous
les hommes qui ont quelque chose de lourd à porter.
--Pourquoi cet homme si éloquent a-t-il quitté Paris? Dans quel dessein
est-il venu à Besançon? On ne lui a donc pas dit combien les étrangers y
avaient peu de chance de réussite? On s'y servira de lui, mais les
Bisontins ne l'y laisseront pas se servir d'eux. Pourquoi, s'il est
venu, a-t-il fait si peu de frais qu'il a fallu la fantaisie du premier
président pour la mettre en évidence? dit la belle madame de
Chavoncourt.
--Après avoir bien étudié cette belle tête, reprit l'abbé de Grancey qui
regarda finement son interruptrice en donnant à penser qu'il taisait
quelque chose, et surtout après l'avoir entendu répliquant ce matin à
l'un des aigles du barreau de Paris, je pense que cet homme, qui doit
avoir trente-cinq ans, produira plus tard une grande sensation...
--Pourquoi nous en occuper? Votre procès est gagné, vous l'avez payé,
dit madame de Watteville en observant sa fille qui depuis que le
vicaire-général parlait était comme suspendue à ses lèvres.
La conversation prit un autre cours, et il ne fut plus question d'Albert
Savaron.
Le portrait esquissé par le plus capable des vicaires-généraux du
diocèse eut d'autant plus l'attrait d'un roman pour Philomène qu'il s'y
trouvait un roman. Pour la première fois de sa vie, elle rencontrait cet
extraordinaire, ce merveilleux que caressent toutes les jeunes
imaginations, et au-devant duquel se jette la curiosité, si vive à l'âge
de Philomène. Quel être idéal que cet Albert, sombre, souffrant,
éloquent, travailleur, comparé par mademoiselle de Watteville à ce gros
comte joufflu, crevant de santé, diseur de fleurettes, parlant
d'élégance en face de la splendeur des anciens comtes de Rupt! Amédée ne
lui valait que des querelles et des remontrances, elle ne le connaissait
d'ailleurs que trop, et cet Albert Savaron offrait bien des énigmes à
déchiffrer.
--Albert Savaron de Savarus, répétait-elle en elle-même.
Puis le voir, l'apercevoir!... Ce fut le désir d'une jeune fille
jusque-là sans désir. Elle repassait dans son coeur, dans son
imagination, dans sa tête les moindres phrases dites par l'abbé de
Grancey, car tous les mots avaient porté coup.
--Un beau front, se disait-elle en regardant le front de chaque homme
assis à la table, je n'en vois pas un seul de beau... Celui de monsieur
de Soulas est trop bombé, celui de monsieur de Grancey est beau, mais il
a soixante-dix ans et n'a plus de cheveux, on ne sait plus où finit le
front.
--Qu'avez-vous, Philomène? vous ne mangez pas...
--Je n'ai pas faim, maman, dit-elle.--Des mains de prélat...
reprit-elle en elle-même, je ne me souviens plus de celles de notre bel
archevêque, qui m'a cependant confirmée.
Enfin, au milieu des allées et venues qu'elle faisait dans le labyrinthe
de sa rêverie, elle se rappela, brillant à travers les arbres des deux
jardins contigus, une fenêtre illuminée qu'elle avait aperçue de son lit
quand par hasard elle s'était éveillée pendant la nuit:--C'était donc sa
lumière, se dit-elle, je le pourrai voir! Je le verrai.
--Monsieur de Grancey, tout est-il fini pour le procès du chapitre? dit
à brûle-pourpoint Philomène au vicaire-général pendant un moment de
silence.
Madame de Watteville échangea rapidement un regard avec le
vicaire-général.
--Et qu'est-ce que cela vous fait, ma chère enfant? dit-elle à Philomène
en y mettant une feinte douceur qui rendit sa fille circonspecte pour le
reste de ses jours.
--On peut nous mener en cassation, mais nos adversaires y regarderont à
deux fois, répondit l'abbé.
--Je n'aurais jamais cru que Philomène pût penser pendant tout un dîner
à un procès, reprit madame de Watteville.
--Ni moi non plus, dit Philomène avec un petit air rêveur qui fit rire.
Mais monsieur de Grancey s'en occupait tant que je m'y suis intéressée.
C'est bien innocent!
On se leva de table, et la compagnie revint au salon. Pendant toute la
soirée, Philomène écouta pour savoir si l'on parlerait encore d'Albert
Savaron; mais hormis les félicitations que chaque arrivant adressait à
l'abbé sur le gain du procès, et où personne ne mêla l'éloge de
l'avocat, il n'en fut plus question. Mademoiselle de Watteville attendit
la nuit avec impatience. Elle s'était promis de se lever entre deux et
trois heures du matin pour voir les fenêtres du cabinet d'Albert. Quand
cette heure fut venue, elle éprouva presque du plaisir à contempler la
lueur que projetaient à travers les arbres, presque dépouillés de
feuilles, les bougies de l'avocat. A l'aide de cette excellente vue que
possède une jeune fille et que la curiosité semble étendre, elle vit
Albert écrivant, elle crut distinguer la couleur de l'ameublement qui
lui parut être rouge. La cheminée élevait au-dessus du toit une épaisse
colonne de fumée.
--Quand tout le monde dort, il veille... comme Dieu! se dit-elle.
L'éducation des filles comporte des problèmes si graves, car l'avenir
d'une nation est dans la mère, que depuis long-temps l'Université de
France s'est donné la tâche de n'y point songer. Voici l'un de ces
problèmes.
Doit-on éclairer les jeunes filles, doit-on comprimer leur esprit? il va
sans dire que le système religieux est compresseur: si vous les
éclairez, vous en faites des démons avant l'âge; si vous les empêchez de
penser, vous arrivez à la subite explosion si bien peinte dans le
personnage d'Agnès par Molière, et vous mettez cet esprit comprimé, si
neuf, si perspicace, rapide et conséquent comme le sauvage, à la merci
d'un événement, crise fatale amenée chez mademoiselle de Watteville par
l'imprudente esquisse que se permit à table un des plus prudents abbés
du prudent Chapitre de Besançon.
Le lendemain matin, Philomène de Watteville, en s'habillant, regarda
nécessairement Albert Savaron se promenant dans le jardin contigu à
celui de l'hôtel de Rupt.
--Que serais-je devenue, pensa-t-elle, s'il avait demeuré ailleurs? Je
puis le voir. A quoi pense-t-il?
Après avoir vu, mais à distance, cet homme extraordinaire, le seul dont
la physionomie tranchait vigoureusement sur la masse des figures
bisontines aperçues jusqu'alors, Philomène sauta rapidement à l'idée de
pénétrer dans son intérieur, de savoir les raisons de tant de mystère,
d'entendre cette voix éloquente, de recevoir un regard de ces beaux
yeux. Elle voulut tout cela, mais comment l'obtenir?
Pendant toute la journée, elle tira l'aiguille sur sa broderie avec
cette attention obtuse de la jeune fille qui paraît comme Agnès ne
penser à rien et qui réfléchit si bien sur toute chose que ses ruses
sont infaillibles. De cette profonde méditation, il résulta chez
Philomène une envie de se confesser. Le lendemain matin, après la messe,
elle eut une petite conférence à Saint-Jean avec l'abbé Giroud, et
l'entortilla si bien que la confession fut indiquée pour le dimanche
matin, à sept heures et demie, avant la messe de huit heures. Elle
commit une douzaine de mensonges pour pouvoir se trouver dans l'église,
une seule fois, à l'heure où l'avocat venait entendre la messe. Enfin il
lui prit un mouvement de tendresse excessif pour son père, elle l'alla
voir dans son atelier, et lui demanda mille renseignements sur l'art du
tourneur, pour arriver à conseiller à son père de tourner de grandes
pièces, des colonnes. Après avoir lancé son père dans les colonnes
torses, une des difficultés de l'art du tourneur, elle lui conseilla de
profiter d'un gros tas de pierres qui se trouvait au milieu du jardin
pour en faire faire une grotte, sur laquelle il mettrait un petit temple
en façon de belvéder, où ses colonnes torses seraient employées et
brilleraient aux yeux de toute la société.
Au milieu de la joie que cette entreprise causait à ce pauvre homme
inoccupé, Philomène lui dit en l'embrassant:--Surtout ne dis pas à ma
mère de qui te vient cette idée, elle me gronderait.
--Sois tranquille, répondit monsieur de Watteville qui gémissait tout
autant que sa fille sous l'oppression de la terrible fille des de Rupt.
Ainsi Philomène avait la certitude de voir promptement bâtir un charmant
observatoire d'où la vue plongerait sur le cabinet de l'avocat. Et il y
a des hommes pour lesquels les jeunes filles font de pareils
chefs-d'oeuvre de diplomatie, qui, la plupart du temps, comme Albert
Savaron, n'en savent rien.
Ce dimanche, si peu patiemment attendu, vint, et la toilette de
Philomène fut faite avec un soin qui fit sourire Mariette, la femme de
chambre de madame et de mademoiselle de Watteville.
--Voici la première fois que je vois mademoiselle si vétilleuse? dit
Mariette.
--Vous me faites penser, dit Philomène en lançant à Mariette un regard
qui mit des coquelicots sur les joues de la femme de chambre, qu'il y a
des jours où vous l'êtes aussi plus particulièrement qu'à d'autres.
En quittant le perron, en traversant la cour, en franchissant la porte,
en allant dans la rue, le coeur de Philomène battit comme lorsque nous
pressentons un grand événement. Elle ne savait pas jusqu'alors ce que
c'était que d'aller par les rues: elle avait cru que sa mère lirait ses
projets sur son front et qu'elle lui défendrait d'aller à confesse, elle
se sentit un sang nouveau dans les pieds, elle les leva comme si elle
marchait sur du feu! Naturellement, elle avait pris rendez-vous avec son
confesseur à huit heures un quart, en disant huit heures à sa mère, afin
d'attendre un quart-d'heure environ auprès d'Albert. Elle arriva dans
l'église avant la messe, et, après avoir fait une courte prière, elle
alla voir si l'abbé Giroud était à son confessionnal, uniquement pour
pouvoir flâner dans l'église. Aussi se trouva-t-elle placée de manière à
regarder Albert au moment où il entra dans la cathédrale.
Il faudrait qu'un homme fût atrocement laid pour n'être pas trouvé beau
dans les dispositions où la curiosité mettait mademoiselle de
Watteville. Or, Albert Savaron déjà très-remarquable fit d'autant plus
d'impression sur Philomène que sa manière d'être, sa démarche, son
attitude, tout, jusqu'à son vêtement, avait ce je ne sais quoi qui ne
s'explique que par le mot _mystère_! Il entra. L'église, jusque-là
sombre, parut à Philomène comme éclairée. La jeune fille fut charmée par
cette démarche lente et presque solennelle des gens qui portent un monde
sur leurs épaules, et dont le regard profond, dont le geste s'accordent
à exprimer une pensée ou dévastatrice ou dominatrice. Philomène comprit
alors les paroles du vicaire-général dans toute leur étendue. Oui, ces
yeux d'un jaune brun diaprés de filets d'or, voilaient une ardeur qui se
trahissait par des jets soudains. Philomène, avec une imprudence que
remarqua Mariette, se mit sur le passage de l'avocat de manière à
échanger un regard avec lui; et ce regard cherché lui changea le sang,
car son sang frémit et bouillonna comme si sa chaleur eût doublé. Dès
qu'Albert se fut assis, mademoiselle de Watteville eut bientôt choisi sa
place de manière à le parfaitement voir pendant tout le temps que lui
laisserait l'abbé Giroud. Quand Mariette dit:--Voilà monsieur Giroud, il
parut à Philomène que ce temps n'avait pas duré plus de quelques
minutes. Lorsqu'elle sortit du confessionnal, la messe était dite,
Albert avait quitté la cathédrale.
--Le vicaire-général a raison, pensait-elle, _il_ souffre! Pourquoi cet
aigle, car il a des yeux d'aigle, est-il venu s'abattre sur Besançon?
Oh! je veux tout savoir, et comment?
Sous le feu de ce nouveau désir, Philomène tira les points de sa
tapisserie avec une admirable exactitude, et voilà ses méditations sous
un petit air candide qui jouait la niaiserie à tromper madame de
Watteville. Depuis le dimanche où mademoiselle de Watteville avait reçu
ce regard, ou, si vous voulez, ce baptême de feu, magnifique expression
de Napoléon qui peut servir à l'amour, elle mena chaudement l'affaire du
belvéder.
--Maman, dit-elle une fois qu'il y eut deux colonnes de tournées, mon
père s'est mis en tête une singulière idée, il tourne des colonnes pour
un belvéder qu'il a le projet de faire élever en se servant de ce tas de
pierres qui se trouve au milieu du jardin, approuvez-vous cela? Moi, il
me semble que...
--J'approuve tout ce que fait votre père, répliqua sèchement madame de
Watteville, et c'est le devoir des femmes de se soumettre à leurs maris,
quand même elles n'en approuveraient point les idées... Pourquoi
m'opposerais-je à une chose indifférente en elle-même du moment où elle
amuse monsieur de Watteville?
--Mais c'est que de là nous verrons chez monsieur de Soulas, et monsieur
de Soulas nous y verra quand nous y serons. Peut-être parlerait-on...
--Avez-vous, Philomène, la prétention de conduire vos parents, et d'en
savoir plus qu'eux sur la vie et sur les convenances?
--Je me tais, maman. Au surplus, mon père dit que la grotte fera une
salle où l'on aura frais et où l'on ira prendre le café.
--Votre père a eu là d'excellentes idées, répondit madame de Watteville
qui voulut aller voir les colonnes.
Elle donna son approbation au projet du baron de Watteville en indiquant
pour l'érection du monument une place au fond du jardin d'où l'on
n'était pas vu de chez monsieur de Soulas, mais d'où l'on voyait
admirablement chez monsieur Albert Savaron. Un entrepreneur fut mandé
qui se chargea de faire une grotte au sommet de laquelle on parviendrait
par un petit chemin de trois pieds de large, dans les rocailles duquel
viendraient des pervenches, des iris; des viornes, des lierres, des
chèvrefeuilles, de la vigne vierge. La baronne inventa de faire tapisser
l'intérieur de la grotte en bois rustique alors à la mode pour les
jardinières, de mettre au fond une glace, un divan à couvercle et une
table en marqueterie de bois grume. Monsieur de Soulas proposa de faire
le sol en asphalte. Philomène imagina de suspendre à la voûte un lustre
en bois rustiqué.
--Les Watteville font faire quelque chose de charmant dans leur jardin,
disait-on dans Besançon.
--Ils sont riches, ils peuvent bien mettre mille écus pour une
fantaisie.
--Mille écus?... dit madame de Chavoncourt.
--Oui, mille écus, s'écria le jeune monsieur de Soulas. On fait venir un
homme de Paris pour rustiquer l'intérieur, mais ce sera bien joli.
Monsieur de Watteville fait lui-même le lustre, il se met à sculpter le
bois...
--On dit que Berquet va creuser une cave, dit un abbé.
--Non, reprit le jeune monsieur de Soulas, il fonde le kiosque sur un
massif en béton pour qu'il n'y ait pas d'humidité.
--Vous savez les moindres choses qui se font dans la maison, dit
aigrement madame de Chavoncourt en regardant une de ses grandes filles
bonnes à marier depuis un an.
Mademoiselle de Watteville qui éprouvait un petit mouvement d'orgueil en
pensant au succès de son belvéder, se reconnut une éminente supériorité
sur tout ce qui l'entourait. Personne ne devinait qu'une petite fille,
jugée sans esprit, niaise, avait tout bonnement voulu voir de plus près
le cabinet de l'avocat Savaron.
L'éclatante plaidoirie d'Albert Savaron pour le Chapitre de la
cathédrale fut d'autant plus promptement oubliée que l'envie des avocats
se réveilla. D'ailleurs, fidèle à sa retraite, Savaron ne se montra
nulle part. Sans prôneurs et ne voyant personne, il augmenta les chances
d'oubli qui, dans une ville comme Besançon, abondent pour un étranger.
Néanmoins, il plaida trois fois au tribunal de commerce, dans trois
affaires épineuses qui durent aller à la Cour. Il eut ainsi pour clients
quatre des plus gros négociants de la ville, qui reconnurent en lui tant
de sens et de ce que la province appelle _une bonne judiciaire_, qu'ils
lui confièrent leur contentieux. Le jour où la maison Watteville
inaugura son belvéder, Savaron élevait aussi son monument. Grâces aux
relations sourdes qu'il s'était acquises dans le haut commerce de
Besançon, il y fondait une revue de quinzaine, appelée la Revue de
l'Est, au moyen de quarante actions de chacune cinq cents francs placées
entre les mains de ses dix premiers clients auxquels il fit sentir la
nécessité d'aider aux destinées de Besançon, la ville où devait se fixer
le transit entre Mulhouse et Lyon, le point capital entre le Rhin et le
Rhône.
Pour rivaliser avec Strasbourg, Besançon ne devait-il pas être aussi
bien un centre de lumières qu'un point commercial? On ne pouvait traiter
que dans une Revue les hautes questions relatives aux intérêts de l'Est.
Quelle gloire de ravir à Strasbourg et à Dijon leur influence
littéraire, d'éclairer l'Est de la France, et de lutter avec la
centralisation parisienne. Ces considérations trouvées par Albert furent
redites par les dix négociants qui se les attribuèrent.
L'avocat Savaron ne commit pas la faute de se mettre en nom, il laissa
la direction financière à son premier client, monsieur Boucher, allié
par sa femme à l'un des plus forts éditeurs de grands ouvrages
ecclésiastiques; mais il se réserva la rédaction avec une part comme
fondateur dans les bénéfices. Le commerce fit un appel à Dôle, à Dijon,
à Salins, à Neufchâtel, dans le Jura, Bourg, Nantua, Lons-le-Saulnier.
On y réclama le concours des lumières et des efforts de tous les hommes
studieux des trois provinces du Bugey, de la Bresse et de la Comté.
Grâces aux relations de commerce et de confraternité, cent cinquante
abonnements furent pris, eu égard au bon marché: la Revue coûtait huit
francs par trimestre. Pour éviter de froisser les amours-propres de
province par les refus d'articles, l'avocat eut le bon esprit de faire
désirer la direction littéraire de cette Revue au fils aîné de monsieur
Boucher, jeune homme de vingt-deux ans, très-avide de gloire, à qui les
piéges et les chagrins de la manutention littéraire étaient entièrement
inconnus. Albert conserva secrètement la haute main, et se fit d'Alfred
Boucher un séide. Alfred fut la seule personne de Besançon avec laquelle
se familiarisa le roi du barreau. Alfred venait conférer le matin dans
le jardin avec Albert sur les matières de la livraison. Il est inutile
de dire que le numéro d'essai contint une _Méditation_ d'Alfred qui eut
l'approbation de Savaron. Dans sa conversation avec Alfred, Albert
laissait échapper de grandes idées, des sujets d'articles dont profitait
le jeune Boucher. Aussi le fils du négociant croyait-il exploiter ce
grand homme! Albert était un homme de génie, un profond politique pour
Alfred. Les négociants, enchantés du succès de la Revue, n'eurent à
verser que trois dixièmes de leurs actions. Encore deux cents
abonnements, la Revue allait donner cinq pour cent de dividende à ses
actionnaires, la rédaction n'étant pas payée. Cette rédaction était
impayable.
Au troisième numéro, la Revue avait obtenu l'échange avec tous les
journaux de France qu'Albert lut alors chez lui. Ce troisième numéro
contenait une Nouvelle, signée A. S., et attribuée au fameux avocat.
Malgré le peu d'attention que la haute société de Besançon accordait à
cette Revue accusée de libéralisme, il fut question chez madame de
Chavoncourt, au milieu de l'hiver, de cette première Nouvelle éclose
dans la Comté.
--Mon père, dit Philomène, il se fait une Revue à Besançon, tu devrais
bien t'y abonner et la garder chez toi, car maman ne me la laisserait
pas lire, mais tu me la prêteras.
Empressé d'obéir à sa chère Philomène, qui depuis cinq mois lui donnait
des preuves de tendresse, monsieur de Watteville alla prendre lui-même
un abonnement d'un an à la Revue de l'Est, et prêta les quatre numéros
parus à sa fille. Pendant la nuit Philomène put dévorer cette Nouvelle,
la première qu'elle lut de sa vie; mais elle ne se sentait vivre que
depuis deux mois! Aussi ne faut-il pas juger de l'effet que cette oeuvre
dut produire sur elle d'après les données ordinaires. Sans rien préjuger
du plus ou du moins de mérite de cette composition due à un Parisien qui
apportait en province la manière, l'éclat, si vous voulez, de la
nouvelle école littéraire, elle ne pouvait point ne pas être un
chef-d'oeuvre pour une jeune personne livrant sa vierge intelligence,
son coeur pur à un premier ouvrage de ce genre. D'ailleurs, sur ce
qu'elle en avait entendu dire, Philomène s'était fait, par intuition,
une idée qui rehaussait singulièrement la valeur de cette Nouvelle. Elle
espérait y trouver les sentiments et peut-être quelque chose de la vie
d'Albert. Dès les premières pages, cette opinion prit chez elle une si
grande consistance, qu'après avoir achevé ce fragment, elle eut la
certitude de ne pas se tromper. Voici donc cette confidence où, selon
les critiques du salon Chavoncourt, Albert aurait imité quelques-uns des
écrivains modernes qui, faute d'invention, racontent leurs propres
joies, leurs propres douleurs ou les événements mystérieux de leur
existence.
L'AMBITIEUX PAR AMOUR.
En 1823, deux jeunes gens qui s'étaient donné pour thème de voyage de
parcourir la Suisse, partirent de Lucerne par une belle matinée du mois
de juillet, sur un bateau que conduisaient trois rameurs, et allaient à
Fluelen en se promettant de s'arrêter sur le lac des Quatre-Cantons à
tous les lieux célèbres. Les paysages qui de Lucerne à Fluelen
environnent les eaux, présentent toutes les combinaisons que
l'imagination la plus exigeante peut demander aux montagnes et aux
rivières, aux lacs et aux rochers, aux ruisseaux et à la verdure, aux
arbres et aux torrents. C'est tantôt d'austères solitudes et de gracieux
promontoires, des vallées coquettes et fraîches, des forêts placées
comme un panache sur le granit taillé droit, des baies solitaires et
fraîches qui s'ouvrent, des vallées dont les trésors apparaissent
embellis par le lointain des rêves.
En passant devant le charmant bourg de Gersau, l'un des deux amis
regarda longtemps une maison en bois qui paraissait construite depuis
peu de temps, entourée d'un palis, assise sur un promontoire et presque
baignée par les eaux. Quand le bateau passa devant, une tête de femme
s'éleva du fond de la chambre qui se trouvait au dernier étage de cette
maison, pour jouir de l'effet du bateau sur le lac. L'un des jeunes gens
reçut le coup d'oeil jeté très-indifféremment par l'inconnue.
--Arrêtons-nous ici, dit-il à son ami, nous voulions faire de Lucerne
notre quartier-général pour visiter la Suisse, tu ne trouveras pas
mauvais, Léopold, que je change d'avis, et que je reste ici à garder les
manteaux. Tu feras donc tout ce que tu voudras, moi mon voyage est fini.
Mariniers, virez de bord, et descendez-nous à ce village, nous allons y
déjeuner. J'irai chercher à Lucerne tous nos bagages et tu sauras avant
de partir d'ici, dans quelle maison je me logerai, pour m'y retrouver à
ton retour.
--Ici ou à Lucerne, dit Léopold, il n'y a pas assez de différence pour
que je ne t'empêche d'obéir à un caprice.
Ces deux jeunes gens étaient deux amis dans la véritable acception du
mot. Ils avaient le même âge, leurs études s'étaient faites dans le même
collége; et après avoir fini leur Droit, ils employaient les vacances au
classique voyage de la Suisse. Par un effet de la volonté paternelle,
Léopold était déjà promis à l'Étude d'un notaire à Paris. Son esprit de
rectitude, sa douceur, le calme de ses sens et de son intelligence
garantissaient sa docilité. Léopold se voyait notaire à Paris: sa vie
était devant lui comme un de ces grands chemins qui traversent une
plaine de France, il l'embrassait dans toute son étendue avec une
résignation pleine de philosophie.
Le caractère de son compagnon, que nous appellerons Rodolphe, offrait
avec le sien un contraste dont l'antagonisme avait sans doute eu pour
résultat de resserrer les liens qui les unissaient. Rodolphe était le
fils naturel d'un grand seigneur qui fut surpris par une mort prématurée
sans avoir pu faire de dispositions pour assurer des moyens d'existence
à une femme tendrement aimée et à Rodolphe. Ainsi trompée par un coup du
sort, la mère de Rodolphe avait eu recours à un moyen héroïque. Elle
vendit tout ce qu'elle tenait de la munificence du père de son enfant,
fit une somme de cent et quelques mille francs, la plaça sur sa propre
tête en viager, à un taux considérable, et se composa de cette manière
un revenu d'environ quinze mille francs, en prenant la résolution de
tout consacrer à l'éducation de son fils afin de le douer des avantages
personnels les plus propres à faire fortune, et de lui réserver à force
d'économies un capital à l'époque de sa majorité. C'était hardi, c'était
compter sur sa propre vie; mais sans cette hardiesse, il eût été sans
doute impossible à cette bonne mère de vivre, d'élever convenablement
cet enfant, son seul espoir, son avenir, et l'unique source de ses
jouissances. Né d'une des plus charmantes Parisiennes et d'un homme
remarquable de l'aristocratie brabançonne, fruit d'une passion égale et
partagée, Rodolphe fut affligé d'une excessive sensibilité. Dès son
enfance, il avait manifesté la plus grande ardeur en toute chose. Chez
lui, le Désir devint une force supérieure et le mobile de tout l'être,
le stimulant de l'imagination, la raison de ses actions. Malgré les
efforts d'une mère spirituelle, qui s'effraya dès qu'elle s'aperçut
d'une pareille prédisposition, Rodolphe désirait comme un poëte imagine,
comme un savant calcule, comme un peintre crayonne, comme un musicien
formule des mélodies. Tendre comme sa mère, il s'élançait avec une
violence inouïe et par la pensée vers la chose souhaitée, il dévorait le
temps. En rêvant l'accomplissement de ses projets, il supprimait
toujours les moyens d'exécution.
--Quand mon fils aura des enfants, disait la mère, il les voudra grands
tout de suite.
Cette belle ardeur, convenablement dirigée, servit à Rodolphe à faire de
brillantes études, à devenir ce que les Anglais appellent un parfait
gentilhomme. Sa mère était alors fière de lui, tout en craignant
toujours quelque catastrophe, si jamais une passion s'emparait de ce
coeur, à la fois si tendre et si sensible, si violent et si bon. Aussi
cette prudente femme avait-elle encouragé l'amitié qui liait Léopold à
Rodolphe et Rodolphe à Léopold, en voyant, dans le froid et dévoué
notaire, un tuteur, un confident qui pourrait jusqu'à un certain point
la remplacer auprès de Rodolphe, si par malheur elle venait à lui
manquer. Encore belle à quarante-trois ans, la mère de Rodolphe avait
inspiré la plus vive passion à Léopold. Cette circonstance rendait les
deux jeunes gens encore plus intimes.
Léopold, qui connaissait bien Rodolphe, ne fut donc pas surpris de le
voir, à propos d'un regard jeté sur le haut d'une maison, s'arrêtant à
un village et renonçant à l'excursion projetée au Saint-Gothard. Pendant
qu'on leur préparait à déjeuner à l'auberge du Cygne, les deux amis
firent le tour du village et arrivèrent dans la partie qui avoisinait la
charmante maison neuve où, tout en flânant et causant avec les
habitants, Rodolphe découvrit une maison de petits bourgeois disposés à
le prendre en pension, selon l'usage assez général de la Suisse. On lui
offrit une chambre ayant vue sur le lac, sur les montagnes, et d'où se
découvrait la magnifique vue d'un de ces prodigieux détours qui
recommandent le lac des Quatre-Cantons à l'admiration des touristes.
Cette maison se trouvait séparée par un carrefour et par un petit port,
de la maison neuve où Rodolphe avait entrevu le visage de sa belle
inconnue.
Pour cent francs par mois, Rodolphe n'eut à penser à aucune des choses
nécessaires à la vie. Mais en considération des frais que les époux
Stopfer se proposaient de faire, ils demandèrent le paiement du
troisième mois d'avance. Pour peu que vous frottiez un Suisse, il
reparaît un usurier. Après le déjeuner, Rodolphe s'installa sur-le-champ
en déposant dans sa chambre ce qu'il avait emporté d'effets pour son
excursion au Saint-Gothard, et il regarda passer Léopold qui, par esprit
d'ordre, allait s'acquitter de l'excursion pour le comte de Rodolphe et
pour le sien. Quand Rodolphe assis sur une roche tombée en avant du bord
ne vit plus le bateau de Léopold, il examina, mais en dessous, la maison
neuve en espérant apercevoir l'inconnue. Hélas! il rentra sans que la
maison eût donné signe de vie. Au dîner que lui offrirent monsieur et
madame Stopfer, anciens tonneliers à Neufchâtel, il les questionna sur
les environs, et finit par apprendre tout ce qu'il voulait savoir sur
l'inconnue, grâce au bavardage de ses hôtes qui vidèrent, sans se faire
prier, le sac aux commérages.
L'inconnue s'appelait Fanny Lovelace. Ce nom, qui se prononce
_Loveless_, appartient à de vieilles familles anglaises; mais Richardson
en a fait une création dont la célébrité nuit à toute autre. Miss
Lovelace était venue s'établir sur le lac pour la santé de son père, à
qui les médecins avaient ordonné l'air du canton de Lucerne. Ces deux
Anglais, arrivés sans autre domestique qu'une petite fille de quatorze
ans, très-attachée à miss Fanny, une petite muette qui la servait avec
intelligence, s'étaient arrangés, avant l'hiver dernier, avec monsieur
et madame Bergmann, anciens jardiniers en chef de Son Excellence le
comte Borroméo à l'_isola Bella_ et à l'_isola Madre_, sur le lac
Majeur. Ces Suisses, riches d'environ mille écus de rentes, louaient
l'étage supérieur de leur maison aux Lovelace à raison de deux cents
francs par an pour trois ans. Le vieux Lovelace, vieillard nonagénaire
très-cassé, trop pauvre pour se permettre certaines dépenses, sortait
rarement; sa fille travaillait pour le faire vivre en traduisant,
disait-on, des livres anglais et faisant elle-même des livres. Aussi les
Lovelace n'osaient-ils ni louer de bateaux pour se promener sur le lac,
ni chevaux, ni guides pour visiter les environs. Un dénûment qui exige
de pareilles privations excite d'autant plus la compassion des Suisses,
qu'ils y perdent une occasion de gain. La cuisinière de la maison
nourrissait ces trois Anglais à raison de cent francs par mois tout
compris. Mais on croyait dans tout Gersau que les anciens jardiniers,
malgré leurs prétentions à la bourgeoisie, se cachaient sous le nom de
leur cuisinière pour réaliser les bénéfices de ce marché. Les Bergmann
s'étaient créé d'admirables jardins et une serre magnifique autour de
leur habitation. Les fleurs, les fruits, les raretés botaniques de cette
habitation avaient déterminé la jeune miss à la choisir à son passage à
Gersau. On donnait dix-neuf ans à miss Fanny qui, le dernier enfant de
ce vieillard, devait être adulée par lui. Il n'y avait pas plus de deux
mois, elle s'était procuré un piano à loyer, venu de Lucerne, car elle
paraissait folle de musique.
--Elle aime les fleurs et la musique, pensa Rodolphe, et elle est à
marier? quel bonheur!
Le lendemain, Rodolphe fit demander la permission de visiter les serres
et les jardins qui commençaient à jouir d'une certaine célébrité. Cette
permission ne fut pas immédiatement accordée. Ces anciens jardiniers
demandèrent, chose étrange! à voir le passeport de Rodolphe qui l'envoya
sur-le-champ. Le passeport ne lui fut renvoyé que le lendemain par la
cuisinière, qui lui fit part du plaisir que ses maîtres auraient à lui
montrer leur établissement. Rodolphe n'alla pas chez les Bergmann sans
un certain tressaillement que connaissent seuls les gens à émotions
vives, et qui déploient dans un moment autant de passion que certains
hommes en dépensent pendant toute leur vie. Mis avec recherche pour
plaire aux anciens jardiniers des îles Borromées, car il vit en eux les
gardiens de son trésor, il parcourut les jardins en regardant de temps
en temps la maison, mais avec prudence: les deux vieux propriétaires lui
témoignaient une assez visible défiance. Mais son attention fut bientôt
excitée par la petite Anglaise muette en qui sa sagacité, quoique jeune
encore, lui fit reconnaître une fille de l'Afrique, ou tout au moins une
Sicilienne. Cette petite fille avait le ton doré d'un cigare de la
Havane, des yeux de feu, des paupières arméniennes à cils d'une longueur
anti-britannique, des cheveux plus que noirs, et sous cette peau presque
olivâtre des nerfs d'une force singulière, d'une vivacité fébrile. Elle
jetait sur Rodolphe des regards inquisiteurs d'une effronterie
incroyable, et suivait ses moindres mouvements.
--A qui cette petite Moresque appartient-elle? dit-il à la respectable
madame Bergmann.
--Aux Anglais, répondit monsieur Bergmann.
--Elle n'est toujours pas née en Angleterre!
--Ils l'auront peut-être amenée des Indes, répondit madame Bergmann.
--On m'a dit que la jeune miss Lovelace aimait la musique, je serais
enchanté si, pendant mon séjour sur ce lac auquel me condamne une
ordonnance de médecin, elle voulait me permettre de faire de la musique
avec elle...
--Ils ne reçoivent et ne veulent voir personne, dit le vieux jardinier.
Rodolphe se mordit les lèvres, et sortit sans avoir été invité à entrer
dans la maison, ni avoir été conduit dans la partie du jardin qui se
trouvait entre la façade et le bord du promontoire. De ce côté, la
maison avait au-dessus du premier étage une galerie en bois couverte par
le toit dont la saillie était excessive, comme celle des couvertures de
chalet, et qui tournait sur les quatre côtés du bâtiment, à la mode
suisse. Rodolphe avait beaucoup loué cette élégante disposition et vanté
la vue de cette galerie, mais ce fut en vain. Quand il eut salué les
Bergmann, il se trouva sot vis-à-vis de lui-même, comme tout homme
d'esprit et d'imagination trompé par l'insuccès d'un plan à la réussite
duquel il a cru.
Le soir, il se promena naturellement en bateau sur le lac, autour de ce
promontoire, il alla jusqu'à Brünnen, à Schwitz, et revint à la nuit
tombante. De loin il aperçut la fenêtre ouverte et fortement éclairée,
il put entendre les sons du piano et les accents d'une voix délicieuse.
Aussi fit-il arrêter afin de s'abandonner au charme d'écouter un air
italien divinement chanté. Quand le chant eut cessé, Rodolphe aborda,
renvoya la barque et les deux bateliers. Au risque de se mouiller les
pieds, il vint s'asseoir sous le banc de granit rongé par les eaux que
couronnait une forte haie d'acacias épineux, et le long de laquelle
s'étendait, dans le jardin Bergmann, une allée de jeunes tilleuls. Au
bout d'une heure, il entendit parler et marcher au-dessus de sa tête,
mais les mots qui parvinrent à son oreille étaient tous italiens et
prononcés par deux voix de femmes, deux jeunes femmes. Il profita du
moment où les deux interlocutrices se trouvaient à une extrémité pour se
glisser à l'autre sans bruit. Après une demi-heure d'efforts, il
atteignit au bout de l'allée et put, sans être aperçu ni entendu,
prendre une position d'où il verrait les deux femmes sans être vu par
elles quand elles viendraient à lui. Quel ne fut pas l'étonnement de
Rodolphe en reconnaissant la petite muette pour une des deux femmes,
elle parlait en italien avec miss Lovelace. Il était alors onze heures
du soir. Le calme était si grand sur le lac et autour de l'habitation,
que ces deux femmes devaient se croire en sûreté: dans tout Gersau il
n'y avait que leurs yeux qui pussent être ouverts. Rodolphe pensa que le
mutisme de la petite était une ruse nécessaire. A la manière dont se
parlait l'italien, Rodolphe devina que c'était la langue maternelle de
ces deux femmes, il en conclut que la qualité d'Anglais cachait une
ruse.
--C'est des Italiens réfugiés, se dit-il, des proscrits qui sans doute
ont à craindre la police de l'Autriche ou de la Sardaigne. La jeune
fille attend la nuit pour pouvoir se promener et causer en toute sûreté.
Aussitôt il se coucha le long de la haie et rampa comme un serpent pour
trouver un passage entre deux racines d'acacia. Au risque d'y laisser
son habit ou de se faire de profondes blessures au dos, il traversa la
haie quand la prétendue miss Fanny et sa prétendue muette furent à
l'autre extrémité de l'allée; puis quand elles arrivèrent à vingt pas de
lui sans le voir, car il se trouvait dans l'ombre de la haie alors
fortement éclairée par la lueur de la lune, il se leva brusquement.
--Ne craignez rien, dit-il en français à l'Italienne, je ne suis pas un
espion. Vous êtes des réfugiés, je l'ai deviné. Moi, je suis un Français
qu'un seul de vos regards a cloué à Gersau.
Rodolphe, atteint par la douleur que lui causa un instrument d'acier en
lui déchirant le flanc, tomba terrassé.
--_Nel lago con pietra_, dit la terrible muette.
--Ah! _Gina_, s'écria l'Italienne.
--Elle m'a manqué, dit Rodolphe en retirant de la plaie un stylet qui
s'était heurté contre une fausse côte, mais, un peu plus haut, il
allait au fond de mon coeur. J'ai eu tort, Francesca, dit-il en se
souvenant du nom que la petite Gina avait plusieurs fois prononcé, je ne
lui en veux pas, ne la grondez point: le bonheur de vous parler vaut
bien un coup de stylet! seulement, montrez-moi le chemin, il faut que je
regagne la maison Stopfer. Soyez tranquilles, je ne dirai rien.
Francesca, revenue de son étonnement, aida Rodolphe à se relever, et dit
quelques mots à Gina dont les yeux s'emplirent de larmes. Les deux
femmes forcèrent Rodolphe à s'asseoir sur un banc, à quitter son habit,
son gilet, sa cravate. Gina ouvrit la chemise et suça fortement la
plaie. Francesca qui les avait quittés, revint avec un large morceau de
taffetas d'Angleterre, et l'appliqua sur la blessure..
--Vous pourrez aller ainsi jusqu'à votre maison, reprit-elle.
Chacune d'elles s'empara d'un bras, et Rodolphe fut conduit à une petite
porte dont la clef se trouvait dans la poche du tablier de Francesca.
--Gina parle-t-elle français? dit Rodolphe à Francesca.
--Non. Mais ne vous agitez pas, dit Francesca d'un petit ton
d'impatience.
--Laissez-moi vous voir, répondit Rodolphe avec attendrissement, car
peut-être serai-je longtemps sans pouvoir venir...
Il s'appuya sur un des poteaux de la petite porte et contempla la belle
Italienne, qui se laissa regarder pendant un instant par le plus beau
silence et par la plus belle nuit qui jamais ait éclairé ce lac, le roi
des lacs suisses. Francesca était bien l'Italienne classique, et telle
que l'imagination veut, fait ou rêve, si vous voulez, les Italiennes. Ce
qui saisit tout d'abord Rodolphe, ce fut l'élégance et la grâce de la
taille dont la vigueur se trahissait malgré son apparence frêle, tant
elle était souple. Une pâleur d'ambre répandue sur la figure accusait un
intérêt subit, mais qui n'effaçait pas la volupté de deux yeux humides
et d'un noir velouté. Deux mains, les plus belles que jamais sculpteur
grec ait attachées au bras poli d'une statue, tenaient le bras de
Rodolphe: et leur blancheur tranchait sur le noir de l'habit.
L'imprudent Français ne put qu'entrevoir la forme ovale un peu longue du
visage dont la bouche attristée, entr'ouverte, laissait voir des dents
éclatantes entre deux larges lèvres fraîches et colorées. La beauté des
lignes de ce visage garantissait à Francesca la durée de cette
splendeur; mais ce qui frappa le plus Rodolphe fut l'adorable
laisser-aller, la franchise italienne de cette femme qui s'abandonnait
entièrement à sa compassion.
Francesca dit un mot à Gina, qui donna son bras à Rodolphe jusqu'à la
maison Stopfer et se sauva comme une hirondelle quand elle eut sonné.
--Ces patriotes n'y vont pas de main morte! se disait Rodolphe en
sentant ses souffrances quand il se trouva seul dans son lit. _Nel
lago!_ Gina m'aurait jeté dans le lac avec une pierre au cou!
Au jour, il envoya chercher à Lucerne le meilleur chirurgien; et quand
il fut venu, il lui recommanda le plus profond secret en lui faisant
entendre que l'honneur l'exigeait. Léopold revint de son excursion le
jour où son ami quittait le lit. Rodolphe lui fit un conte et le chargea
d'aller à Lucerne chercher les bagages et leurs lettres. Léopold apporta
la plus funeste, la plus horrible nouvelle: la mère de Rodolphe était
morte. Pendant que les deux amis allaient de Bâle à Lucerne, la fatale
lettre, écrite par le père de Léopold, y était arrivée le jour de leur
départ pour Fuelen. Malgré les précautions que prit Léopold, Rodolphe
fut saisi par une fièvre nerveuse. Dès que le futur notaire vit son ami
hors de danger, il partit pour la France muni d'une procuration.
Rodolphe put ainsi rester à Gersau, le seul lieu du monde où sa douleur
pouvait se calmer. La situation du jeune Français, son désespoir et les
circonstances qui rendaient cette perte plus affreuse pour lui que pour
tout autre, furent connues et attirèrent sur lui la compassion et
l'intérêt de tout Gersau. Chaque matin la fausse muette vint voir le
Français afin de donner des nouvelles à sa maîtresse.
Quand Rodolphe put sortir, il alla chez les Bergmann remercier miss
Fanny Lovelace et son père de l'intérêt qu'ils lui avaient témoigné.
Pour la première fois depuis son établissement chez les Bergmann, le
vieil Italien laissa pénétrer un étranger dans son appartement où
Rodolphe fut reçu avec une cordialité due et à ses malheurs et à sa
qualité de Français qui excluait toute défiance. Francesca se montra si
belle aux lumières pendant la première soirée, qu'elle fit entrer un
rayon dans ce coeur abattu. Ses sourires jetèrent les roses de
l'espérance sur ce deuil. Elle chanta, non point des airs gais, mais de
graves et sublimes mélodies appropriées à l'état du coeur de Rodolphe
qui remarqua ce soin touchant. Vers huit heures, le vieillard laissa ces
deux jeunes gens seuls sans aucune apparence de crainte, et se retira
chez lui. Quand Francesca fut fatiguée de chanter, elle amena Rodolphe
sous la galerie extérieure, d'où se découvrait le sublime spectacle du
lac, et lui fit signe de s'asseoir près d'elle sur un banc de bois
rustique.
--Y a-t-il de l'indiscrétion à vous demander votre âge, _cara_
Francesca? fit Rodolphe.
--Dix-neuf ans, répondit-elle, mais passés.
--Si quelque chose au monde pouvait atténuer ma douleur, ce serait,
reprit-il, l'espoir de vous obtenir de votre père, en quelque situation
de fortune que vous soyez, belle comme vous êtes, vous me paraissez plus
riche que ne le serait la fille d'un prince. Aussi tremblé-je en vous
faisant l'aveu des sentiments que vous m'avez inspirés; mais ils sont
profonds, ils sont éternels.
--_Zitto!_ fit Francesca en mettant un des doigts de sa main droite sur
ses lèvres. N'allez pas plus loin: je ne suis pas libre, je suis mariée,
depuis trois ans...
Un profond silence régna pendant quelques instants entre eux. Quand
l'Italienne, effrayée de la pose de Rodolphe, s'approcha de lui, elle le
trouva tout à fait évanoui.
--_Povero!_ se dit-elle, moi qui le trouvais froid.
Elle alla chercher des sels, et ranima Rodolphe en les lui faisant
respirer.
--Mariée! dit Rodolphe en regardant Francesca. Ses larmes coulèrent
alors en abondance.
--Enfant, dit-elle, il y a de l'espoir. Mon mari a...
--Quatre-vingts ans?... dit Rodolphe.
--Non, répondit elle en souriant, soixante-cinq. Il s'est fait un masque
de vieillard pour déjouer la police.
--Chère, dit Rodolphe, encore quelques émotions de ce genre et je
mourrais... Après vingt années de connaissance seulement, vous saurez
quelle est la force et la puissance de mon coeur, de quelle nature sont
ses aspirations vers le bonheur. Cette plante ne monte pas avec plus de
vivacité pour s'épanouir aux rayons du soleil, dit-il en montrant un
jasmin de Virginie qui enveloppait la balustrade, que je ne me suis
attaché depuis un mois à vous. Je vous aime d'un amour unique. Cet amour
sera le principe secret de ma vie, et j'en mourrai peut-être!
--Oh! Français, Français! fit-elle en commentant son exclamation par une
petite moue d'incrédulité.
--Ne faudra-t-il pas vous attendre, vous recevoir des mains du Temps?
reprit-il avec gravité. Mais, sachez-le: si vous êtes sincère dans la
parole qui vient de vous échapper, je vous attendrai fidèlement sans
laisser aucun autre sentiment croître dans mon coeur.
Elle le regarda sournoisement.
--Rien, dit-il, pas même une fantaisie. J'ai ma fortune à faire, il vous
en faut une splendide, la nature vous a créée princesse....
A ce mot, Francesca ne put retenir un faible sourire qui donna
l'expression la plus ravissante à son visage, quelque chose de fin comme
ce que le grand Léonard a si bien peint dans la _Joconde_. Ce sourire
fit faire une pause à Rodolphe.
--.... Oui, reprit-il, vous devez souffrir du dénûment auquel vous
réduit l'exil. Ah! si vous voulez me rendre heureux entre tous les
hommes, et sanctifier mon amour, vous me traiterez en ami. Ne dois-je
pas être votre ami aussi? Ma pauvre mère m'a laissé soixante mille
francs d'économie, prenez-en la moitié?
Francesca le regarda fixement. Ce regard perçant alla jusqu'au fond de
l'âme de Rodolphe.
--Nous n'avons besoin de rien, mes travaux suffisent à notre luxe,
répondit-elle d'une voix grave.
--Puis-je souffrir qu'une Francesca travaille? s'écria-t-il. Un jour
vous reviendrez dans votre pays, et vous y retrouverez ce que vous y
avez laissé... De nouveau la jeune Italienne regarda Rodolphe... Et vous
me rendrez ce que vous aurez daigné m'emprunter, ajouta-t-il avec un
regard plein de délicatesse.
--Laissons ce sujet de conversation, dit-elle avec une incomparable
noblesse de geste, de regard et d'attitude. Faites une brillante
fortune, soyez un des hommes remarquables de votre pays, je le veux.
L'illustration est un pont-volant qui peut servir à franchir un abîme.
Soyez ambitieux, il le faut. Je vous crois de hautes et de puissantes
facultés; mais servez-vous-en plus pour le bonheur de l'humanité que
pour me mériter: vous en serez plus grand à mes yeux.
Dans cette conversation qui dura deux heures, Rodolphe découvrit en
Francesca l'enthousiasme des idées libérales et ce culte de la liberté
qui avait fait la triple révolution de Naples, du Piémont et d'Espagne.
En sortant, il fut conduit jusqu'à la porte par Gina, la fausse muette.
A onze heures, personne ne rôdait dans ce village, aucune indiscrétion
n'était à craindre, Rodolphe attira Gina dans un coin, et lui demanda
tout bas en mauvais italien:--Qui sont tes maîtres, mon enfant? dis-le
moi, je te donnerai cette pièce d'or toute neuve.
--Monsieur, répondit l'enfant en prenant la pièce, monsieur est le
fameux libraire Lamporani de Milan, l'un des chefs de la révolution, et
le conspirateur que l'Autriche désire le plus tenir au Spielberg.
--La femme d'un libraire!... Eh! tant mieux, pensa-t-il, nous sommes de
plain-pied.
--De quelle famille est-elle? reprit-il, car elle a l'air d'une reine.
--Toutes les Italiennes sont ainsi, répondit fièrement Gina. Le nom de
son père est Colonna.
Enhardi par l'humble condition de Francesca, Rodolphe fit mettre un
tendelet à sa barque et des coussins à l'arrière. Quand ce changement
fut opéré, l'amoureux vint proposer à Francesca de se promener sur le
lac. L'Italienne accepta, sans doute pour jouer son rôle de jeune miss
aux yeux du village; mais elle emmena Gina. Les moindres actions de
Francesca Colonna trahissaient une éducation supérieure et le plus haut
rang social. A la manière dont s'assit l'Italienne au bout de la barque,
Rodolphe se sentit en quelque sorte séparé d'elle; et devant
l'expression d'une vraie fierté de noble, sa familiarité préméditée
tomba. Par un regard, Francesca se fit princesse avec tous les
priviléges dont elle eût joui au Moyen-Age. Elle semblait avoir deviné
les secrètes pensées de ce vassal qui avait l'audace de se constituer
son protecteur. Déjà, dans l'ameublement du salon où Francesca l'avait
reçu, dans sa toilette et dans les petites choses qui lui servaient,
Rodolphe avait reconnu les indices d'une nature élevée et d'une haute
fortune. Toutes ces observations lui revinrent à la fois dans la
mémoire, et il devint rêveur après avoir été pour ainsi dire refoulé par
la dignité de Francesca. Gina, cette confidente à peine adolescente,
semblait elle-même avoir un masque railleur en regardant Rodolphe en
dessous ou de côté. Ce visible désaccord entre la condition de
l'Italienne et ses manières fut une nouvelle énigme pour Rodolphe, qui
soupçonna quelqu'autre ruse semblable au faux mutisme de Gina.
--Où voulez-vous aller? _signora Lamporani_, dit-il.
--Vers Lucerne, répondit en français Francesca.
--Bon! pensa Rodolphe, elle n'est pas étonnée de m'entendre lui
dire son nom, elle avait sans doute prévu ma demande à Gina, la
rusée!--Qu'avez-vous contre moi? dit-il en venant enfin s'asseoir près
d'elle et lui demandant par un geste une main que Francesca retira. Vous
êtes froide et cérémonieuse; en style de conversation, nous dirions
_cassante_.
--C'est vrai, répliqua-t-elle en souriant. J'ai tort. Ce n'est pas bien.
C'est bourgeois. Vous diriez en français ce n'est pas artiste. Il vaut
mieux s'expliquer que de garder contre un ami des pensées hostiles ou
froides, et vous m'avez prouvé déjà votre amitié. Peut-être suis-je allé
trop loin avec vous. Vous avez dû me prendre pour une femme
très-ordinaire... Rodolphe multiplia des signes de dénégation.--... Oui,
dit cette femme de libraire en continuant sans tenir compte de la
pantomime qu'elle voyait bien d'ailleurs. Je m'en suis aperçue, et
naturellement je reviens sur moi-même. Eh! bien je terminerai tout par
quelques paroles d'une profonde vérité. Sachez-le bien, Rodolphe: je
sens en moi la force d'étouffer un sentiment qui ne serait pas en
harmonie avec les idées ou la prescience que j'ai du véritable amour. Je
puis aimer comme nous savons aimer en Italie; mais je connais mes
devoirs: aucune ivresse ne peut me les faire oublier. Mariée sans mon
consentement à ce pauvre vieillard, je pourrais user de la liberté qu'il
me laisse avec tant de générosité; mais trois ans de mariage équivalent
à une acceptation de la loi conjugale. Aussi la plus violente passion ne
me ferait-elle pas émettre, même involontairement, le désir de me
trouver libre. Émilio connaît mon caractère. Il sait que, hors mon coeur
qui m'appartient et que je puis livrer, je ne me permettrais pas de
laisser prendre ma main. Voilà pourquoi je viens de vous la refuser. Je
veux être aimée, attendue avec fidélité, noblesse, ardeur, en ne pouvant
accorder qu'une tendresse infinie dont l'expression ne dépassera point
l'enceinte du coeur, le terrain permis. Toutes ces choses bien
comprises.... oh! reprit-elle avec un geste de jeune fille, je vais
redevenir coquette, rieuse, folle, comme un enfant qui ne connaît pas le
danger de la familiarité.
Cette déclaration si nette, si franche fut faite d'un ton, d'un accent
et accompagnée de regards qui lui donnèrent la plus grande profondeur de
vérité.
--Une princesse Colonna n'aurait pas mieux parlé, dit Rodolphe en
souriant.
--Est-ce, répliqua-t-elle avec un air de hauteur, un reproche sur
l'humilité de ma naissance? Faut-il un blason à votre amour? A Milan,
les plus beaux noms: Sforza, Canova, Visconti, Trivulzio, Ursini sont
écrits au-dessus des boutiques, il y a des Archinto apothicaires; mais
croyez que, malgré ma condition de boutiquière, j'ai les sentiments
d'une duchesse.
--Un reproche? non, madame, j'ai voulu vous faire un éloge.
--Par une comparaison?... dit elle avec finesse.
--Ah! sachez-le, reprit-il, afin de ne plus me tourmenter si mes paroles
peignaient mal mes sentiments, mon amour est absolu, il comporte une
obéissance et un respect infinis.
Elle inclina la tête en femme satisfaite et dit:--Monsieur accepte alors
le traité?
--Oui, dit-il. Je comprends que, dans une puissante et riche
organisation de femme, la faculté d'aimer ne saurait se perdre, et que,
par délicatesse, vous vouliez la restreindre. Ah! Francesca, une
tendresse partagée, à mon âge et avec une femme aussi sublime, aussi
royalement belle que vous l'êtes, mais c'est voir tous mes désirs
comblés. Vous aimer comme vous voulez être aimée, n'est-ce pas pour un
jeune homme se préserver de toutes les folies mauvaises? n'est-ce pas
employer ses forces dans une noble passion de laquelle on peut être fier
plus tard, et qui ne donne que de beaux souvenirs?..... Si vous saviez
de quelles couleurs, de quelle poésie vous venez de revêtir la chaîne du
Pilate, le Rhigi, et ce magnifique bassin.....
--Je veux le savoir, dit-elle.
--Hé! bien, cette heure rayonnera sur toute ma vie, comme un diamant au
front d'une reine.
Pour toute réponse, Francesca posa sa main sur celle de Rodolphe.
--Oh! chère, à jamais chère, dites, vous n'avez jamais aimé?
--Jamais!
--Et vous me permettez de vous aimer noblement, en attendant tout du
ciel?
Elle inclina doucement la tête. Deux grosses larmes roulèrent sur les
joues de Rodolphe.
--Hé! bien, qu'avez-vous? dit-elle en quittant son rôle d'impératrice.
--Je n'ai plus ma mère pour lui dire combien je suis heureux, elle a
quitté cette terre sans voir ce qui eût adouci son agonie....
--Quoi? fit-elle.
--Sa tendresse remplacée par une tendresse égale.
--_Povero mio_, s'écria l'Italienne attendrie. C'est, croyez-moi,
reprit-elle après une pause, une bien douce chose et un bien grand
élément de fidélité pour une femme que de se savoir tout sur la terre
pour celui qu'elle aime, de le voir seul, sans famille, sans rien dans
le coeur que son amour, enfin de l'avoir bien tout entier.
Quand deux amants se sont entendus ainsi, le coeur éprouve une
délicieuse quiétude, une sublime tranquillité. La certitude est la base
que veulent les sentiments humains, car elle ne manque jamais au
sentiment religieux: l'homme est toujours certain d'être payé de retour
par Dieu. L'amour ne se croit en sûreté que par cette similitude avec
l'amour divin. Aussi faut-il les avoir pleinement éprouvées pour
comprendre les voluptés de ce moment, toujours unique dans la vie: il ne
revient pas plus que ne reviennent les émotions de la jeunesse. Croire à
une femme, faire d'elle sa religion humaine, le principe de sa vie, la
lumière secrète de ses moindres pensées!... n'est-ce pas une seconde
naissance? Un jeune homme mêle alors à son amour un peu de celui qu'il a
pour sa mère. Rodolphe et Francesca gardèrent pendant quelque temps le
plus profond silence, se répondant par des regards amis et pleins de
pensées. Ils se comprenaient au milieu d'un des plus beaux spectacles de
la nature, dont les magnificences expliquées par celles de leurs coeurs,
les aidaient à se graver dans leurs mémoires les plus fugitives
impressions de cette heure unique. Il n'y avait pas eu l'ombre de
coquetterie dans la conduite de Francesca. Tout en était large, plein,
sans arrière-pensée. Cette grandeur frappa vivement Rodolphe, qui
reconnaissait en ceci la différence qui distingue l'Italienne de la
Française. Les eaux, la terre, le ciel, la femme, tout fut donc
grandiose et suave, même leur amour, au milieu de ce tableau vaste dans
son ensemble, riche dans ses détails, et où l'âpreté des cimes
neigeuses, leurs plis raides nettement détachés sur l'azur rappelaient à
Rodolphe les conditions dans lesquelles devait se renfermer son bonheur:
un riche pays cerclé de neige.
Cette douce ivresse de l'âme devait être troublée. Une barque venait de
Lucerne; Gina, qui depuis quelque temps la regardait avec attention, fit
un geste de joie en restant fidèle à son rôle de muette. La barque
approchait, et quand enfin Francesca put y distinguer les
figures:--Tito! s'écria-t-elle en apercevant un jeune homme. Elle se
leva debout au risque de se noyer, et cria:--Tito! Tito! en agitant son
mouchoir. Tito donna l'ordre à ses bateliers de nager, et les deux
barques se mirent sur la même ligne. L'Italienne et l'Italien parlèrent
avec une si grande vivacité, dans un dialecte si peu connu d'un homme
qui savait à peine l'italien des livres, et n'était pas allé en Italie,
que Rodolphe ne put rien entendre ni deviner de cette conversation. La
beauté de Tito, la familiarité de Francesca, l'air de joie de Gina, tout
le chagrinait. D'ailleurs il n'est pas d'amoureux qui ne soit mécontent
de se voir quitter pour quoi que ce soit. Tito jeta vivement un petit
sac de peau, sans doute plein d'or, à Gina, puis un paquet de lettres à
Francesca qui se mit à les lire en faisant un geste d'adieu à Tito.
--Retournez promptement à Gersau, dit-elle aux bateliers. Je ne veux pas
laisser languir mon pauvre Émilio dix minutes de trop.
--Que vous arrive-t-il? demanda Rodolphe quand il vit l'Italienne
achevant sa dernière lettre.
--_La liberta!_ fit-elle avec un enthousiasme d'artiste.
--_E denaro!_ répondit comme un écho Gina qui pouvait enfin parler.
--Oui, reprit Francesca, plus de misère! voici plus de onze mois que je
travaille, et je commençais à m'ennuyer. Je ne suis décidément pas une
femme littéraire.
--Quel est ce Tito? fit Rodolphe.
--Le secrétaire d'état au département des finances de la pauvre boutique
de Colonna, autrement dit le fils de notre _ragyionato_. Pauvre garçon!
il n'a pu venir par le Saint-Gothard, ni par le Mont-Cenis, ni par le
Simplon: il est venu par mer, par Marseille, il a dû traverser la
France. Enfin, dans trois semaines, nous serons à Genève, et nous y
vivrons à l'aise. Allons, Rodolphe, dit-elle en voyant la tristesse se
peindre sur le visage du Parisien, le lac de Genève ne vaudra-t-il pas
bien le lac des Quatre-Cantons?...
--Permettez-moi d'accorder un regret à cette délicieuse maison Bergmann,
dit Rodolphe en montrant le promontoire.
--Vous viendrez dîner avec nous, pour y multiplier vos souvenirs,
_povero mio_, dit-elle. C'est fête aujourd'hui, nous ne sommes plus en
danger. Ma mère me dit que dans un an, peut-être, nous serons amnistiés.
Oh! _la cara patria_...
Ces trois mots firent pleurer Gina qui dit:--Encore un hiver, je serais
morte ici!
--Pauvre petite chèvre de Sicile! fit Francesca en passant sa main sur
la tête de Gina par un geste et avec une affection qui firent désirer à
Rodolphe d'être ainsi caressé, quoique ce fût sans amour.
La barque abordait, Rodolphe sauta sur le sable, tendit la main à
l'Italienne, la reconduisit jusqu'à la porte de la maison Bergmann, et
alla s'habiller pour revenir au plus tôt.
En trouvant le libraire et sa femme assis sur la galerie extérieure,
Rodolphe réprima difficilement un geste de surprise à l'aspect du
prodigieux changement que la bonne nouvelle avait apporté chez le
nonagénaire. Il apercevait un homme d'environ soixante ans, parfaitement
conservé, un Italien sec, droit comme un i, les cheveux encore noirs,
quoique rares, et laissant voir un crâne blanc, des yeux vifs, des dents
au complet et blanches, un visage de César, et sur une bouche
diplomatique un sourire quasi sardonique, le sourire presque faux sous
lequel l'homme de bonne compagnie cache ses vrais sentiments.
--Voici mon mari sous sa forme naturelle, dit gravement Francesca.
--C'est tout-à-fait une nouvelle connaissance, répondit Rodolphe
interloqué.
--Tout-à-fait, dit le libraire. J'ai joué la comédie, et sais
parfaitement me grimer. Ah! je jouais à Paris du temps de l'empire, avec
Bourrienne, madame Murat, madame d'Abrantès, _e tutti quanti_... Tout ce
qu'on s'est donné la peine d'apprendre dans sa jeunesse, et même les
choses futiles nous servent. Si ma femme n'avait pas reçu cette
éducation virile, un contre-sens en Italie, il m'eût fallu, pour vivre
ici, devenir bûcheron. _Povera_ Francesca! qui m'eût dit qu'elle me
nourrirait un jour?
En écoutant ce digne libraire, si aisé, si affable et si vert, Rodolphe
crut à quelque mystification et resta dans le silence observateur de
l'homme dupé.
--_Che avete, signor?_ lui demanda naïvement Francesca. Notre bonheur
vous attristerait-il?
--Votre mari est un jeune homme, lui dit-il à l'oreille.
Elle partit d'un éclat de rire si franc, si communicatif, que Rodolphe
en fut encore plus interdit.
--Il n'a que soixante-cinq ans à vous offrir, dit-elle; mais je vous
assure que c'est encore quelque chose.... de rassurant.
--Je n'aime pas à vous voir plaisanter avec un amour aussi saint que
celui dont les conditions ont été posées par vous.
--_Zitto!_ fit-elle en frappant du pied et en regardant si son mari les
écoutait. Ne troublez jamais la tranquillité de ce cher homme, candide
comme un enfant, et de qui je fais ce que je veux. Il est,
ajouta-t-elle, sous ma protection. Si vous saviez avec quelle noblesse
il a risqué sa vie et sa fortune parce que j'étais libérale! car il ne
partage pas mes opinions politiques. Est-ce aimer cela, monsieur le
Français?--Mais ils sont ainsi dans leur famille. Le frère cadet
d'Émilio fut trahi par celle qu'il aimait pour un charmant jeune homme.
Il s'est passé son épée au travers du coeur, et dix minutes auparavant
il a dit à son valet de chambre:--Je tuerais bien mon rival; mais cela
ferait trop de chagrin à _la diva_.
Ce mélange de noblesse et de raillerie, de grandeur et d'enfantillage,
faisait en ce moment de Francesca la créature la plus attrayante du
monde. Le dîner fut, ainsi que la soirée, empreint d'une gaieté que la
délivrance des deux réfugiés justifiait, mais qui contrista Rodolphe.
--Serait-elle légère? se disait-il en regagnant la maison Stopfer. Elle
a pris part à mon deuil, et moi je n'épouse pas sa joie!
Il se gronda, justifia cette femme-jeune-fille.
--Elle est sans aucune hypocrisie et s'abandonne à ses impressions...,
se dit-il. Et je la voudrais comme une Parisienne.
Le lendemain et les jours suivants, pendant vingt jours enfin, Rodolphe
passa tout son temps à la maison Bergmann, observant Francesca sans
s'être promis de l'observer. L'admiration chez certaines âmes ne va pas
sans une sorte de pénétration. Le jeune Français reconnut en Francesca
la jeune fille imprudente, la nature vraie de la femme encore insoumise,
se débattant par instants avec son amour, et s'y laissant aller
complaisamment en d'autres moments. Le vieillard se comportait bien avec
elle comme un père avec sa fille, et Francesca lui témoignait une
reconnaissance profondément sentie qui réveillait en elle d'instinctives
noblesses. Cette situation et cette femme présentaient à Rodolphe une
énigme impénétrable, mais dont la recherche l'attachait de plus en plus.
Ces derniers jours furent remplis de fêtes secrètes, entremêlées de
mélancolies, de révoltes, de querelles plus charmantes que les heures où
Rodolphe et Francesca s'entendaient. Enfin, il était de plus en plus
séduit par la naïveté de cette tendresse sans esprit, semblable à
elle-même en toute chose, de cette tendresse jalouse d'un rien... déjà!
--Vous aimez bien le luxe! dit-il un soir à Francesca qui manifestait
le désir de quitter Gersau où beaucoup de choses lui manquaient.
--Moi! dit-elle, j'aime le luxe comme j'aime les arts, comme j'aime un
tableau de Raphaël, un beau cheval, une belle journée, ou la baie de
Naples. Émilio, dit-elle, me suis-je plainte ici pendant nos jours de
misère?
--Vous n'eussiez pas été vous-même, dit gravement le vieux libraire.
--Après tout, n'est-il pas naturel à des bourgeois d'ambitionner la
grandeur? reprit-elle en lançant un malicieux coup d'oeil et à Rodolphe
et à son mari. Mes pieds, dit-elle en avançant deux petits pieds
charmants, sont-ils faits pour la fatigue. Mes mains... Elle tendit une
main à Rodolphe. Ces mains sont-elles faites pour travailler?
Laissez-nous, dit-elle à son mari: je veux lui parler.
Le vieillard rentra dans le salon avec une sublime bonhomie: il était
sûr de sa femme.
--Je ne veux pas, dit-elle à Rodolphe, que vous nous accompagniez à
Genève. Genève est une ville à caquetages. Quoique je sois bien
au-dessus des niaiseries du monde, je ne veux pas être calomniée, non
pour moi, mais pour _lui_. Je mets mon orgueil à être la gloire de ce
vieillard, mon seul protecteur après tout. Nous partons, restez ici
pendant quelques jours. Quand vous viendrez à Genève, voyez d'abord mon
mari, laissez-vous présenter à moi par lui. Cachons notre inaltérable et
profonde affection aux regards du monde. Je vous aime, vous le savez;
mais voici de quelle manière je vous le prouverai: vous ne surprendrez
pas dans ma conduite quoi que ce soit qui puisse réveiller votre
jalousie.
Elle l'attira dans le coin de la galerie, le prit par la tête, le baisa
sur le front et se sauva, le laissant stupéfait.
Le lendemain, Rodolphe apprit qu'au petit jour les hôtes de la maison
Bergmann étaient partis. L'habitation de Gersau lui parut dès lors
insupportable, et il alla chercher Vevay par le chemin le plus long, en
voyageant plus promptement qu'il ne le devait; mais attiré par les eaux
du lac où l'attendait la belle Italienne, il arriva vers la fin du mois
d'octobre à Genève. Pour éviter les inconvénients de la ville, il se
logea dans une maison située aux Eaux-Vives en dehors des remparts. Une
fois installé, son premier soin fut de demander à son hôte, un ancien
bijoutier, s'il n'était pas venu depuis peu s'établir des réfugiés
italiens, des Milanais à Genève.
--Non, que je sache, lui répondit son hôte. Le prince et la princesse
Colonna de Rome ont loué pour trois ans la campagne de monsieur
Jeanrenaud, une des plus belles du lac. Elle est située entre la
Villa-Diodati et la campagne de monsieur Lafin-de-Dieu qu'a louée la
vicomtesse de Beauséant. Le prince Colonne est venu là pour sa fille et
pour son gendre le prince Gandolphini, un Napolitain, ou, si vous
voulez, Sicilien, ancien partisan du roi Murat et victime de la dernière
révolution. Voilà les derniers venus à Genève, et ils ne sont point
Milanais. Il a fallu de grandes démarches et la protection que le pape
accorde à la famille Colonna pour qu'on ait obtenu, des puissances
étrangères et du roi de Naples, la permission pour le prince et la
princesse Gandolphini de résider ici. Genève ne veut rien faire qui
déplaise à la Sainte-Alliance, à qui elle doit son indépendance. _Notre_
rôle n'est pas de fronder les Cours étrangères. Il y a beaucoup
d'étrangers ici: des Russes, des Anglais.
--Il y a même des Genevois.
--Oui, monsieur. Notre lac est si beau! Lord Byron y a demeuré il y a
sept ans environ, à la Villa-Diodati, que maintenant tout le monde va
voir comme Coppet, comme Ferney.
--Vous ne pourriez pas savoir s'il est venu, depuis une semaine un
libraire de Milan et sa femme, un nommé Lamporani, l'un des chefs de la
dernière révolution?
--Je puis le savoir en allant au Cercle des Étrangers, dit l'ancien
bijoutier.
La première promenade de Rodolphe eut naturellement pour objet la
Villa-Diodati, cette résidence de lord Byron à laquelle la mort récente
de ce grand poëte donnait encore plus d'attrait: la mort est le sacre du
génie. Le chemin qui des Eaux-Vives côtoie le lac de Genève est comme
toutes les routes de Suisse, assez étroit; mais en certains endroits,
par la disposition du terrain montagneux, à peine reste-t-il assez
d'espace pour que deux voitures s'y croisent. A quelques pas de la
maison Jeanrenaud, près de laquelle il arrivait sans le savoir, Rodolphe
entendit derrière lui le bruit d'une voiture; et, se trouvant dans une
espèce de gorge, il grimpa sur la pointe d'une roche pour laisser le
passage libre. Naturellement il regarda venir la voiture, une élégante
calèche attelée de deux magnifiques chevaux anglais. Il lui prit un
éblouissement en voyant au fond de cette calèche Francesca divinement
mise, à côté d'une vieille dame, raide comme un camée. Un chasseur
étincelant de dorures se tenait debout derrière. Francesca reconnut
Rodolphe, et sourit de le retrouver comme une statue sur un piédestal.
La voiture, que l'amoureux suivit de ses regards en gravissant la
hauteur, tourna pour entrer par la porte d'une maison de campagne vers
laquelle il courut.
--Qui demeure ici? demanda-t-il au jardinier.
--Le prince et la princesse Colonne, ainsi que le prince et la princesse
Gandolphini.
--N'est-ce pas elles qui rentrent?
--Oui, monsieur.
En un moment un voile tomba des yeux de Rodolphe: il vit clair dans le
passé.
--Pourvu, se dit enfin l'amoureux foudroyé, que ce soit sa dernière
mystification!
Il tremblait d'avoir été le jouet d'un caprice, car il avait entendu
parler de ce qu'est un _capriccio_ pour une Italienne. Mais quel crime
aux yeux d'une femme, d'avoir accepté pour une bourgeoise, une princesse
née princesse? d'avoir pris la fille d'une des plus illustres familles
du moyen âge, pour la femme d'un libraire! Le sentiment de ses fautes
redoubla chez Rodolphe son désir de savoir s'il serait méconnu,
repoussé. Il demanda le prince Gandolphini en lui faisant porter une
carte, et fut aussitôt reçu par le faux Lamporani, qui vint au-devant de
lui, l'accueillit avec une grâce parfaite, avec une affabilité
napolitaine, et le promena le long d'une terrasse d'où l'on découvrait
Genève, le Jura et ses collines chargées de villas, puis les rives du
lac sur une grande étendue.
--Ma femme, vous le voyez, est fidèle aux lacs, dit-il après avoir
détaillé le paysage à son hôte. Nous avons une espèce de concert ce
soir, ajouta-t-il en revenant vers la magnifique maison Jeanrenaud,
j'espère que vous nous ferez le plaisir, à la princesse et à moi, d'y
venir. Deux mois de misères supportées de compagnie équivalent à des
années d'amitié.
Quoique dévoré de curiosité, Rodolphe n'osa demander à voir la
princesse, il retourna lentement aux Eaux-Vives, préoccupé de la soirée.
En quelques heures, son amour, quelque immense qu'il fût déjà, se
trouvait agrandi par ses anxiétés et par l'attente des événements. Il
comprenait maintenant la nécessité de se faire illustre pour se trouver,
socialement parlant, à la hauteur de son idole. Francesca devenait bien
grande à ses yeux, par le laisser-aller et la simplicité de sa conduite
à Gersau. L'air naturellement altier de la princesse Colonna faisait
trembler Rodolphe, qui allait avoir pour ennemis le père et la mère de
Francesca, du moins il le pouvait croire; et le mystère que la princesse
Gandolphini lui avait tant recommandé lui parut alors une admirable
preuve de tendresse. En ne voulant pas compromettre l'avenir, Francesca
ne disait-elle pas bien qu'elle aimait Rodolphe?
Enfin, neuf heures sonnèrent, Rodolphe put monter en voiture et dire
avec une émotion facile à comprendre:--A la maison Jeanrenaud, chez le
prince Gandolphini!
Enfin, il entra dans le salon plein d'étrangers de la plus haute
distinction, et où il resta forcément dans un groupe près de la porte,
car en ce moment on chantait un duo de Rossini.
Enfin, il put voir Francesca, mais sans être vu par elle. La princesse
était debout à deux pas du piano. Ses admirables cheveux, si abondants
et si longs, étaient retenus par un cercle d'or. Sa figure, illuminée
par les bougies, éclatait de la blancheur particulière aux Italiennes et
qui n'a tout son effet qu'aux lumières. Elle était en costume de bal,
laissant admirer des épaules magnifiques et fascinantes, sa taille de
jeune fille, et des bras de statue antique. Sa beauté sublime était là
sans rivalité possible, quoiqu'il y eût des Anglaises et des Russes
charmantes, les plus jolies femmes de Genève et d'autres Italiennes,
parmi lesquelles brillaient l'illustre princesse de Varèse et la fameuse
cantatrice Tinti qui chantait en ce moment. Rodolphe, appuyé contre le
chambranle de la porte, regarda la princesse en dardant sur elle ce
regard fixe, persistant, attractif et chargé de toute la volonté humaine
concentrée dans ce sentiment appelé _désir_, mais qui prend alors le
caractère d'un violent commandement. La flamme de ce regard
atteignit-elle Francesca? Francesca s'attendait-elle de moment en moment
à voir Rodolphe? Au bout de quelques minutes, elle coula un regard vers
la porte, comme attirée par ce courant d'amour, et ses yeux, sans
hésiter, se plongèrent dans les yeux de Rodolphe. Un léger frémissement
agita ce magnifique visage et ce beau corps: la secousse de l'âme
réagissait! Francesca rougit. Rodolphe eut comme toute une vie dans cet
échange, si rapide qu'il n'est comparable qu'à un éclair. Mais à quoi
comparer son bonheur: il était aimé! La sublime princesse tenait, au
milieu du monde, dans la belle maison Jeanrenaud, la parole donnée par
la pauvre exilée, par la capricieuse de la maison Bergmann. L'ivresse
d'un pareil moment rend esclave pour toute une vie! Un fin sourire,
élégant et rusé, candide et triomphateur, agita les lèvres de la
princesse Gandolphini, qui, dans un moment où elle ne se crut pas
observée, regarda Rodolphe en ayant l'air de lui demander pardon de
l'avoir trompé sur sa condition. Le morceau terminé, Rodolphe put
arriver jusqu'au prince, qui l'amena gracieusement à sa femme. Rodolphe
échangea les cérémonies d'une présentation officielle avec la princesse,
le prince Colonne et Francesca. Quand ce fut fini, la princesse dut
faire sa partie dans le fameux quatuor de _Mi manca la voce_, qui fut
exécuté par elle, par la Tinti, par Génovèse le fameux ténor, et par un
célèbre prince italien alors en exil, et dont la voix, s'il n'eût pas
été prince, l'aurait fait un des princes de l'art.
--Asseyez-vous là, dit à Rodolphe Francesca qui lui montra sa propre
chaise à elle. _Oimè!_ je crois qu'il y a erreur de nom: je suis, depuis
un moment, princesse Rodolphini.
Ce fut dit avec une grâce, un charme, une naïveté, qui rappelèrent dans
cet aveu caché sous une plaisanterie les jours heureux de Gersau.
Rodolphe éprouva la délicieuse sensation d'écouter la voix d'une femme
adorée en se trouvant si près d'elle, qu'il avait une de ses joues
presque effleurée par l'étoffe de la robe et par la gaze de l'écharpe.
Mais quand, en un pareil moment, c'est _Mi manca la voce_ qui se chante
et que ce quatuor est exécuté par les plus belles voix de l'Italie, il
est facile de comprendre comment des larmes vinrent mouiller les yeux de
Rodolphe.
En amour, comme en toute chose peut-être, il est certains faits, minimes
en eux-mêmes, mais le résultat de mille petites circonstances
antérieures, et dont la portée devient immense en résumant le passé, en
se rattachant à l'avenir. On a senti mille fois la valeur de la personne
aimée; mais un rien, le contact parfait des âmes unies dans une
promenade par une parole, par une _preuve_ d'amour inattendue, porte le
sentiment à son plus haut degré. Enfin, pour rendre ce fait moral par
une image qui, depuis le premier âge du monde, a eu le plus
incontestable succès: il y a, dans une longue chaîne, des points
d'attache nécessaires où la cohésion est plus profonde que dans ses
guirlandes d'anneaux. Cette reconnaissance entre Rodolphe et Francesca,
pendant cette soirée, à la face du monde, fut un de ces points suprêmes
qui relient l'avenir au passé, qui clouent plus avant au coeur les
attachements réels. Peut-être est-ce de ces clous épars que Bossuet a
parlé en leur comparant la rareté des moments heureux de notre
existence, lui qui ressentit si vivement et si secrètement l'amour.
Après le plaisir d'admirer soi-même une femme aimée, vient celui de la
voir admirée par tous: Rodolphe eut alors les deux à la fois. L'amour
est un trésor de souvenirs, et quoique celui de Rodolphe fût déjà plein,
il y ajouta les perles les plus précieuses: des sourires jetés en côté
pour lui seul, des regards furtifs, des inflexions de chant que
Francesca trouva pour lui, mais qui firent pâlir de jalousie la Tinti,
tant elles furent applaudies. Aussi, toute sa puissance de désir, cette
forme spéciale de son âme, se jeta-t-elle sur la belle Romaine qui
devint inaltérablement le principe et la fin de toutes ses pensées et de
ses actions. Rodolphe aima comme toutes les femmes peuvent rêver d'être
aimées, avec une force, une constance, une cohésion qui faisait de
Francesca la substance même de son coeur; il la sentit mêlée à son sang
comme un sang plus pur, à son âme comme une âme plus parfaite; elle
allait être sous les moindres efforts de sa vie comme le sable doré de
la Méditerranée sous l'onde. Enfin, la moindre aspiration de Rodolphe
fut une active espérance.
Au bout de quelques jours, Francesca reconnut cet immense amour; mais il
était si naturel, si bien partagé, qu'elle n'en fut pas étonnée: elle en
était digne.
--Qu'y a-t-il de surprenant, disait-elle à Rodolphe en se promenant avec
lui sur la terrasse de son jardin après avoir surpris un de ces
mouvements de fatuité si naturels aux Français dans l'expression de
leurs sentiments, quoi de merveilleux à ce que vous aimiez une femme
jeune et belle, assez artiste pour pouvoir gagner sa vie comme la Tinti,
et qui peut donner quelques jouissances de vanité? Quel est le butor qui
ne deviendrait alors un Amadis? Ceci n'est pas la question entre nous:
il faut aimer avec constance, avec persistance et à distance pendant des
années, sans autre plaisir que celui de se voir aimé.
--Hélas! lui dit Rodolphe, ne trouvez-vous pas ma fidélité dénuée de
tout mérite en me voyant occupé par les travaux d'une ambition
dévorante? Croyez-vous que je veuille vous voir échanger un jour le beau
nom de princesse Gandolphini pour celui d'un homme qui ne serait rien?
Je veux devenir un des hommes les plus remarquables de mon pays, être
riche, être grand, et que vous puissiez être aussi fière de mon nom que
de votre nom de Colonna.
--Je serais bien fâchée de ne pas vous voir de tels sentiments au coeur,
répondit-elle avec un charmant sourire. Mais ne vous consumez pas trop
dans les travaux de l'ambition, restez jeune... On dit que la politique
rend un homme promptement vieux.
Ce qu'il y a de plus rare chez les femmes est une certaine gaieté qui
n'altère point la tendresse. Ce mélange d'un sentiment profond et de la
folie du jeune âge ajouta dans ce moment d'adorables attraits à ceux de
Francesca. Là est la clef de son caractère: elle rit et s'attendrit,
elle s'exalte et revient à la fine raillerie avec un laisser-aller, une
aisance, qui font d'elle la charmante et délicieuse personne dont la
réputation s'est d'ailleurs étendue au delà de l'Italie. Elle cache sous
les grâces de la femme une instruction profonde, due à la vie
excessivement monotone et quasi monacale qu'elle a menée dans le vieux
château des Colonna. Cette riche héritière fut d'abord destinée au
cloître, étant le quatrième enfant du prince et de la princesse Colonna;
mais la mort de ses deux frères et de sa soeur aînée la tira subitement
de sa retraite pour en faire l'un des plus beaux partis des
États-Romains. Sa soeur aînée ayant été promise au prince Gandolphini,
l'un des plus riches propriétaires de la Sicile, Francesca lui fut
donnée afin de ne rien changer aux affaires de famille. Les Colonna et
les Gandolphini s'étaient toujours alliés entre eux. De neuf à seize
ans, Francesca, dirigée par un monsignore de la famille, avait lu toute
la bibliothèque des Colonna pour donner le change à son ardente
imagination en étudiant les sciences, les arts et les lettres. Mais elle
prit dans l'étude ce goût d'indépendance et d'idées libérales qui la fit
se jeter, ainsi que son mari, dans la révolution. Rodolphe ignorait
encore que, sans compter cinq langues vivantes, Francesca sût le grec,
le latin et l'hébreu. Cette charmante créature avait admirablement
compris qu'une des premières conditions de l'instruction chez une femme,
est d'être profondément cachée.
Rodolphe resta tout l'hiver à Genève. Cet hiver passa comme un jour.
Quand vint le printemps, malgré les exquises jouissances que donne la
société d'une femme d'esprit, prodigieusement instruite, jeune et folle,
cet amoureux éprouva de cruelles souffrances, supportées d'ailleurs avec
courage, mais qui parfois se firent jour sur sa physionomie, qui
percèrent dans ses manières, dans le discours, peut-être parce qu'il ne
les crut pas partagées. Parfois il s'irritait en admirant le calme de
Francesca, qui, semblable aux Anglaises, paraissait mettre son
amour-propre à ne rien exprimer sur son visage, dont la sérénité défiait
l'amour; il l'eût voulue agitée, il l'accusait de ne rien sentir, en
croyant au préjugé qui veut, chez les femmes italiennes, une mobilité
fébrile.
--Je suis Romaine! lui répondit gravement un jour Francesca, qui prit au
sérieux quelques plaisanteries faites à ce sujet par Rodolphe.
Il y eut dans l'accent de cette réponse une profondeur qui lui donna
l'apparence d'une sauvage ironie, et qui fit palpiter Rodolphe. Le mois
de mai déployait les trésors de sa jeune verdure, le soleil avait des
moments de force comme au milieu de l'été. Les deux amants se trouvaient
alors appuyés sur la balustrade en pierre qui, dans une partie de la
terrasse où le terrain se trouve à pic sur le lac, surmonte la muraille
d'un escalier par lequel on descend pour monter en bateau. De la villa
voisine, où se voit un embarcadère à peu près pareil, s'élança comme un
cygne une yole avec son pavillon à flammes, sa tente à baldaquin
cramoisi, sous lequel une charmante femme était mollement assise sur des
coussins rouges, coiffée en fleurs naturelles, conduite par un jeune
homme vêtu comme un matelot, et ramant avec d'autant plus de grâce qu'il
était sous les regards de cette femme.
--Ils sont heureux! dit Rodolphe avec un âpre accent. Claire de
Bourgogne, la dernière de la seule maison qui ait pu rivaliser la maison
de France...
--Oh!... elle vient d'une branche bâtarde, et encore par les femmes...
--Enfin, elle est vicomtesse de Beauséant, et n'a pas...
--Hésité... n'est-ce pas? à s'enterrer avec monsieur Gaston de Nueil,
dit la fille des Colonna. Elle n'est que Française, et je suis
Italienne...
Francesca quitta la balustrade, y laissa Rodolphe, et alla jusqu'au bout
de la terrasse, d'où l'on embrasse une immense étendue du lac. En la
voyant marcher lentement, Rodolphe eut un soupçon d'avoir blessé cette
âme à la fois candide et si savante, si fière et si humble: il eut
froid; il suivit Francesca, qui lui fit signe de la laisser seule; mais
il ne tint pas compte de l'avis, et la surprit essuyant des larmes. Des
pleurs chez une nature si forte!
--Francesca, dit-il en lui prenant la main, y a-t-il un seul regret dans
ton coeur?...
Elle garda le silence, dégagea sa main qui tenait le mouchoir brodé,
pour s'essuyer de nouveau les yeux.
--Pardon, reprit-il. Et, par un élan, il atteignit aux yeux pour essuyer
les larmes par des baisers.
Francesca ne s'aperçut pas de ce mouvement passionné, tant elle était
violemment émue. Rodolphe, croyant à un consentement, s'enhardit; il
saisit Francesca par la taille, la serra sur son coeur et prit un
baiser; mais elle se dégagea par un magnifique mouvement de pudeur
offensée, et à deux pas, en le regardant sans colère, mais avec
résolution:--Partez ce soir, dit-elle, nous ne nous reverrons plus qu'à
Naples.
Malgré la sévérité de cet ordre, il fut exécuté religieusement, car
Francesca le voulut.
De retour à Paris, Rodolphe trouva chez lui le portrait de la princesse
Gandolphini, fait par Schinner, comme Schinner sait faire les portraits.
Ce peintre avait passé par Genève en allant en Italie. Comme il s'était
refusé positivement à faire les portraits de plusieurs femmes, Rodolphe
ne croyait pas que le prince, excessivement désireux du portrait de sa
femme, eût pu vaincre la répugnance du peintre célèbre; mais Francesca
l'avait séduit sans doute, et obtenu de lui, ce qui tenait du prodige,
un portrait original pour Rodolphe, une copie pour Émilio. C'est ce que
lui disait une charmante et délicieuse lettre où la pensée se
dédommageait de la retenue imposée par la religion des convenances.
L'amoureux répondit. Ainsi commença, pour ne plus finir, une
correspondance entre Rodolphe et Francesca, seul plaisir qu'ils se
permirent.
Rodolphe, en proie à une ambition que légitimait son amour, se mit
aussitôt à l'oeuvre. Il voulut d'abord la fortune, et se risqua dans une
entreprise où il jeta toutes ses forces aussi bien que tous ses
capitaux; mais il eut à lutter, avec l'inexpérience de la jeunesse,
contre une duplicité qui triompha de lui. Trois ans se perdirent dans
une vaste entreprise, trois ans d'efforts et de courage.
Le ministère Villèle succombait aussi quand succomba Rodolphe. Aussitôt
l'intrépide amoureux voulut demander à la Politique ce que l'Industrie
lui avait refusé; mais avant de se lancer dans les orages de cette
carrière, il alla tout blessé, tout souffrant, faire panser ses plaies
et puiser du courage à Naples, où le prince et la princesse Gandolphini
furent rappelés et réintégrés dans leurs biens à l'avénement du roi. Au
milieu de sa lutte, ce fut un repos plein de douceur, il passa trois
mois à la villa Gandolphini, bercé d'espérances.
Rodolphe recommença l'édifice de sa fortune. Déjà ses talents avaient
été distingués, il allait enfin réaliser les voeux de son ambition, une
place éminente était promise à son zèle, en récompense de son dévouement
et de services rendus, quand éclata l'orage de juillet 1830, et sa
barque sombra de nouveau.
Elle et Dieu, tels sont les deux témoins des efforts les plus courageux,
des plus audacieuses tentatives d'un jeune homme doué de qualités, mais
à qui, jusqu'alors, a manqué le secours du dieu des sots, le Bonheur! Et
cet infatigable athlète, soutenu par l'amour, recommence de nouveaux
combats, éclairé par un regard toujours ami, par un coeur fidèle!
Amoureux! priez pour lui!
En achevant ce récit, qu'elle dévora, mademoiselle de Watteville avait
les joues en feu, la fièvre était dans ses veines; elle pleurait, mais
de rage. Cette Nouvelle, inspirée par la littérature alors à la mode,
était la première lecture de ce genre qu'il fût permis à Philomène de
faire. L'amour y était peint, sinon par une main de maître, du moins par
un homme qui semblait raconter ses propres impressions; or, la vérité,
fut-elle inhabile, devait toucher une âme encore vierge. Là, se trouvait
le secret des agitations terribles, de la fièvre et des larmes de
Philomène: elle était jalouse de Francesca Colonne. Elle ne doutait pas
de la sincérité de cette poésie: Albert avait pris plaisir à raconter le
début de sa passion en cachant sans doute les noms, peut-être aussi les
lieux. Philomène était saisie d'une infernale curiosité. Quelle femme
n'eût pas, comme elle, voulu savoir le vrai nom de sa rivale, car elle
aimait! En lisant ces pages contagieuses pour elle, elle s'était dit ce
mot solennel: J'aime! Elle aimait Albert, et se sentait au coeur une
mordante envie de le disputer, de l'arracher à cette rivale inconnue.
Elle pensa qu'elle ne savait pas la musique et qu'elle n'était pas
belle.
--Il ne m'aimera jamais, se dit-elle.
Cette parole redoubla son désir de savoir si elle ne se trompait pas, si
réellement Albert aimait une princesse italienne, et s'il était aimé
d'elle. Durant cette fatale nuit, l'esprit de décision rapide qui
distinguait le fameux Watteville se déploya tout entier chez son
héritière. Elle enfanta de ces plans bizarres autour desquels flottent
d'ailleurs presque toutes les imaginations de jeunes filles, quand, au
milieu de la solitude où quelques mères imprudentes les retiennent,
elles sont excitées par un événement capital que le système de
compression auquel elles sont soumises n'a pu ni prévoir ni empêcher.
Elle pensait à descendre avec une échelle, par le kiosque, dans le
jardin de la maison où demeurait Albert, à profiter du sommeil de
l'avocat, pour voir par sa fenêtre l'intérieur de son cabinet. Elle
pensait à lui écrire, elle pensait à briser les liens de la société
bisontine, en introduisant Albert dans le salon de l'hôtel de Rupt.
Cette entreprise, qui eût paru le chef-d'oeuvre de l'impossible à l'abbé
de Grancey lui-même, fut l'affaire d'une pensée.
--Ah! se dit-elle, mon père a des contestations à sa terre des Rouxey,
j'irai! S'il n'y a pas de procès, j'en ferai naître, et _il_ viendra
dans notre salon! s'écria-t-elle en s'élançant de son lit à sa fenêtre
pour aller voir la lumière prestigieuse qui éclairait les nuits
d'Albert. Une heure du matin sonnait, il dormait encore.
--Je vais le voir à son lever, il viendra peut-être à sa fenêtre!
En ce moment, mademoiselle de Watteville fut témoin d'un événement qui
devait remettre entre ses mains le moyen d'arriver à connaître les
secrets d'Albert. A la lueur de la lune, elle aperçut deux bras tendus
hors du kiosque, et qui aidèrent Jérôme, le domestique d'Albert, à
franchir la crête du mur et à entrer sous le kiosque. Dans la complice
de Jérôme, Philomène reconnut aussitôt Mariette, la femme de chambre.
--Mariette et Jérôme, se dit-elle. Mariette, une fille si laide! Certes,
ils doivent avoir honte l'un et l'autre.
Si Mariette était horriblement laide et âgée de trente-six ans, elle
avait eu par héritage plusieurs quartiers de terre. Depuis dix-sept ans
au service de madame de Watteville, qui l'estimait fort à cause de sa
dévotion, de sa probité, de son ancienneté dans la maison, elle avait
sans doute économisé, placé ses gages et ses profits. Or, à raison
d'environ dix louis par année, elle devait posséder, en comptant les
intérêts des intérêts et ses héritages, environ quinze mille francs. Aux
yeux de Jérôme, quinze mille francs changeaient les lois de l'optique:
il trouvait à Mariette une jolie taille, il ne voyait plus les trous et
les coutures qu'une affreuse petite vérole avait laissés sur ce visage
plat et sec; pour lui, la bouche contournée était droite; et, depuis
qu'en le prenant à son service, l'avocat Savaron l'avait rapproché de
l'hôtel de Rupt, il fit le siége en règle de la dévote femme de chambre,
aussi raide, aussi prude que sa maîtresse, et qui, semblable à toutes
les vieilles filles laides, se montrait plus exigeante que les plus
belles personnes. Si maintenant la scène nocturne du kiosque est
expliquée pour les personnes clairvoyantes, elle l'était très-peu pour
Philomène, qui néanmoins y gagna la plus dangereuse de toutes les
instructions, celle que donne le mauvais exemple. Une mère élève
sévèrement sa fille, la couve de ses ailes pendant dix-sept ans, et dans
une heure, une servante détruit ce long et pénible ouvrage, quelquefois
par un mot, souvent par un geste! Philomène se recoucha, non sans penser
à tout le parti qu'elle pouvait tirer de sa découverte. Le lendemain
matin, en allant à la messe en compagnie de Mariette (la baronne était
indisposée), Philomène prit le bras de sa femme de chambre, ce qui
surprit étrangement la Comtoise.
--Mariette, lui dit-elle, Jérôme a-t-il la confiance de son maître?
--Je ne sais pas, mademoiselle.
--Ne faites pas l'innocente avec moi, répondit sèchement Philomène. Vous
vous êtes laissé embrasser par lui cette nuit, sous le kiosque. Je ne
m'étonne plus si vous approuviez tant ma mère à propos des
embellissements qu'elle y projetait.
Philomène sentit le tremblement qui saisit Mariette par celui de son
bras.
--Je ne vous veux pas de mal, dit Philomène en continuant,
rassurez-vous, je ne dirai pas un mot à ma mère, et vous pourrez voir
Jérôme tant que vous voudrez.
--Mais, mademoiselle, répondit Mariette, c'est en tout bien, tout
honneur, Jérôme n'a pas d'autre intention que celle de m'épouser...
--Mais alors, pourquoi vous donner des rendez-vous la nuit?
Mariette atterrée ne sut rien répondre.
--Écoutez, Mariette, j'aime aussi, moi! J'aime en secret et toute seule.
Je suis, après tout, unique enfant de mon père et de ma mère; ainsi vous
avez plus à espérer de moi que de qui que ce soit au monde...
--Certainement, mademoiselle, vous pouvez compter sur nous à la vie et à
la mort, s'écria Mariette, heureuse de ce dénoûment imprévu.
--D'abord, silence pour silence, dit Philomène. Je ne veux pas épouser
monsieur de Soulas; mais je veux, et absolument, une certaine chose: ma
protection ne vous appartient qu'à ce prix.
--Quoi? demanda Mariette.
--Je veux voir les lettres que monsieur Savaron fera mettre à la poste
par Jérôme.
--Mais pourquoi faire? dit Mariette effrayée.
--Oh! rien que pour lire, et vous les jetterez vous-même à la poste
après. Cela ne fera qu'un peu de retard, voilà tout.
En ce moment, Philomène et Mariette entrèrent à l'église, et chacune
d'elles fit ses réflexions, au lieu de lire l'Ordinaire de la messe.
--Mon Dieu! combien y a-t-il donc de péchés dans tout cela? se dit
Mariette.
Philomène, dont l'âme, la tête et le coeur étaient bouleversés par la
lecture de la Nouvelle, y vit enfin une sorte d'histoire écrite pour sa
rivale. A force de réfléchir, comme les enfants, à la même chose, elle
finit par penser que la Revue de l'Est devait être envoyée à la
bien-aimée d'Albert.
--Oh! se disait-elle à genoux, la tête plongée dans ses mains, et dans
l'attitude d'une personne abîmée dans la prière, oh! comment amener mon
père à consulter la liste des gens à qui l'on envoie cette Revue?
Après le déjeuner, elle fit un tour de jardin avec son père, en le
cajolant, et l'amena sous le kiosque.
--Crois-tu, mon cher petit père, que notre Revue aille à l'étranger?
--Elle ne fait que commencer...
--Eh! bien, je parie qu'elle y va.
--Ce n'est guère possible.
--Va le savoir, et prends les noms des abonnés à l'étranger.
Deux heures après, monsieur de Watteville dit à sa fille:--J'ai raison,
il n'y a pas encore un abonné dans les pays étrangers. L'on espère en
avoir à Neufchâtel, à Berne, à Genève. On en envoie bien un exemplaire
en Italie, mais gratuitement, à une dame milanaise, à sa campagne sur le
lac Majeur, à Belgirate.
--Son nom, dit vivement Philomène.
--La duchesse d'Argaiolo.
--La connaissez-vous, mon père?
--J'en ai naturellement entendu parler. Elle est née princesse Soderini,
c'est une Florentine, une très-grande dame, et tout aussi riche que son
mari, qui possède une des plus belles fortunes de la Lombardie. Leur
villa sur le lac Majeur est une des curiosités de l'Italie.
Deux jours après, Mariette remit la lettre suivante à Philomène.
  ALBERT SAVARON A LÉOPOLD HANNEQUIN.
  «Eh! bien, oui, mon cher ami, je suis à Besançon pendant que tu me
  croyais en voyage. Je n'ai rien voulu te dire qu'au moment où le succès
  commencerait, et voici son aurore. Oui, cher Léopold, après tant
  d'entreprises avortées où j'ai dépensé le plus pur de mon sang, où j'ai
  jeté tant d'efforts, usé tant de courage, j'ai voulu faire comme toi:
  prendre une voie battue, le grand chemin, le plus long, le plus sûr.
  Quel bond je te vois faire sur ton fauteuil de notaire! Mais ne crois
  pas qu'il y ait quoi que ce soit de changé à ma vie intérieure, dans le
  secret de laquelle il n'y a que toi au monde, et encore sous les
  réserves qu'_elle_ a exigées. Je ne te le disais pas, mon ami; mais je
  me lassais horriblement à Paris. Le dénoûment de la première entreprise
  où j'ai mis toutes mes espérances et qui s'est trouvée sans résultats
  par la profonde scélératesse de mes deux associés, d'accord pour me
  tromper, pour me dépouiller, moi, à l'activité de qui tout était dû, m'a
  fait renoncer à chercher la fortune pécuniaire après avoir ainsi perdu
  trois ans de ma vie, dont une année à plaider. Peut-être m'en serais-je
  plus mal tiré, si je n'avais pas été contraint, à vingt ans, d'étudier
  le Droit. J'ai voulu devenir un homme politique, uniquement pour être un
  jour compris dans une ordonnance sur la pairie sous le titre de comte
  Albert Savaron de Savarus, et faire revivre en France un beau nom qui
  s'éteint en Belgique, encore que je ne sois ni légitime, ni légitimé!»
--Ah! j'en étais sûre, il est noble! s'écria Philomène en laissant
tomber la lettre.
  «Tu sais quelles études consciencieuses j'ai faites, quel journaliste
  obscur, mais dévoué, mais utile, et quel admirable secrétaire je fus
  pour l'homme d'État qui, d'ailleurs, me fut fidèle en 1829. Replongé
  dans le néant par la révolution de juillet, alors que mon nom commençait
  à briller, au moment où, maître des requêtes, j'allais enfin entrer,
  comme un rouage nécessaire, dans la machine politique, j'ai commis la
  faute de rester fidèle aux vaincus, de lutter pour eux, sans eux. Ah!
  pourquoi n'avais-je que trente-trois ans, et comment ne t'ai-je pas prié
  de me rendre éligible? Je t'ai caché tous mes dévouements et mes périls.
  Que veux-tu? j'avais la foi! nous n'eussions pas été d'accord. Il y a
  dix mois, pendant que tu me voyais si gai, si content, écrivant mes
  articles politiques, j'étais au désespoir: je me voyais à trente-sept
  ans, avec deux mille francs pour toute fortune, sans la moindre
  célébrité, venant d'échouer dans une noble entreprise, celle d'un
  journal quotidien qui ne répondait qu'à un besoin de l'avenir, au lieu
  de s'adresser aux passions du moment. Je ne savais plus quel parti
  prendre. Et, je me sentais! J'allais, sombre et blessé, dans les
  endroits solitaires de ce Paris qui m'avait échappé, pensant à mes
  ambitions trompées, mais sans les abandonner. Oh! quelles lettres
  empreintes de rage ne lui ai-je pas écrites alors, à _elle_, cette
  seconde conscience, cet autre moi! Par moments, je me disais:--Pourquoi
  m'être tracé un si vaste programme pour mon existence? pourquoi tout
  vouloir? pourquoi ne pas attendre le bonheur en me vouant à quelque
  occupation quasi mécanique?
  «J'ai jeté les yeux alors sur une modeste place où je pusse vivre.
  J'allais avoir la direction d'un journal sous un gérant qui ne savait
  pas grand'chose, un homme d'argent ambitieux, quand la terreur m'a pris.
  --«Voudra-t-_elle_ pour mari d'un amant qui sera descendu si bas? me
  suis-je dit.»
  «Cette réflexion m'a rendu mes vingt-deux ans! Oh! mon cher Léopold,
  combien l'âme s'use dans ces perplexités! Que doivent donc souffrir les
  aigles en cage, les lions emprisonnés?... Ils souffrent tout ce que
  souffrait Napoléon, non pas à Sainte-Hélène, mais sur le quai des
  Tuileries, au 10 août, quand il voyait Louis XVI se défendant si mal,
  lui qui pouvait dompter la sédition comme il le fit plus tard sur les
  mêmes lieux, en vendémiaire! Eh! bien, ma vie a été cette souffrance
  d'un jour, étendue sur quatre ans. Combien de discours à la Chambre
  n'ai-je pas prononcés dans les allées désertes du bois de Boulogne? Ces
  improvisations inutiles ont du moins aiguisé ma langue et accoutumé mon
  esprit à formuler ses pensées en paroles. Durant ces tourments secrets,
  toi, tu te mariais, tu achevais de payer ta charge, et tu devenais
  adjoint au maire de ton arrondissement, après avoir gagné la croix en te
  faisant blesser à Saint-Merry.
  «Écoute! Quand j'étais tout petit, et que je tourmentais des hannetons,
  il y avait chez ces pauvres insectes un mouvement qui me donnait presque
  la fièvre. C'est quand je les voyais faisant ces efforts réitérés pour
  prendre leur vol, sans néanmoins s'envoler, quoiqu'ils eussent réussi à
  soulever leurs ailes. Nous disions d'eux: _Ils comptent!_ Était-ce une
  sympathie? était-ce une vision de mon avenir? Oh! déployer ses ailes et
  ne pouvoir voler! Voilà ce qui m'est arrivé depuis cette belle
  entreprise de laquelle on m'a dégoûté, mais qui maintenant a enrichi
  quatre familles.
  «Enfin, il y a sept mois, je résolus de me faire un nom au barreau de
  Paris, en voyant quels vides y laissaient les promotions de tant
  d'avocats à des places éminentes. Mais en me rappelant les rivalités que
  j'avais observées au sein de la Presse, et combien il est difficile de
  parvenir à quoi que ce soit à Paris, cette arène où tant de champions se
  donnent rendez-vous, je pris une résolution cruelle pour moi, d'un effet
  certain et peut-être plus rapide que tout autre. Tu m'avais bien
  expliqué, dans nos causeries, la constitution sociale de Besançon,
  l'impossibilité pour un étranger d'y parvenir, d'y faire la moindre
  sensation, de s'y marier, de pénétrer dans la société, d'y réussir en
  quoi que ce soit. Ce fut là que je voulus aller planter mon drapeau,
  pensant avec raison y éviter la concurrence, et m'y trouver seul à
  briguer la députation. Les Comtois ne veulent pas voir l'étranger,
  l'étranger ne les verra pas! ils se refusent à l'admettre dans leurs
  salons, il n'ira jamais! il ne se montrera nulle part, pas même dans les
  rues! Mais il est une classe qui fait les députés, la classe
  commerçante. Je vais spécialement étudier les questions commerciales que
  je connais déjà, je gagnerai des procès; j'accorderai les différends, je
  deviendrai le plus fort avocat de Besançon. Plus tard, j'y fonderai une
  Revue où je défendrai les intérêts du pays, où je les ferai naître,
  vivre ou renaître. Quand j'aurai conquis un à un assez de suffrages, mon
  nom sortira de l'urne. On dédaignera pendant longtemps l'avocat inconnu,
  mais il y aura une circonstance qui le mettra en lumière, une plaidoirie
  gratuite, une affaire de laquelle les autres avocats ne voudront pas se
  charger. Si je parle une fois, je suis sûr du succès. Eh! bien, mon cher
  Léopold, j'ai fait emballer ma bibliothèque dans onze caisses, j'ai
  acheté les livres de droit qui pouvaient m'être utiles, et j'ai mis
  tout, ainsi que mon mobilier, au roulage pour Besançon. J'ai pris mes
  diplômes, j'ai réuni mille écus et suis venu te dire adieu. La
  malle-poste m'a jeté dans Besançon, où j'ai, dans trois jours de temps,
  choisi un petit appartement qui a vue sur des jardins; j'y ai
  somptueusement arrangé le cabinet mystérieux où je passe mes nuits et
  mes jours, et où brille le portrait de mon idole, de celle à laquelle ma
  vie est vouée, qui la remplit, qui est le principe de mes efforts, le
  secret de mon courage, la cause de mon talent. Puis, quand les meubles
  et les livres sont arrivés, j'ai pris un domestique intelligent, et suis
  resté pendant cinq mois comme une marmotte en hiver. On m'avait
  d'ailleurs inscrit au tableau des avocats. Enfin, on m'a nommé d'office
  pour défendre un malheureux aux Assises, sans doute pour m'entendre
  parler au moins une fois! Un des plus influents négociants de Besançon
  était du jury, il avait une affaire épineuse: j'ai tout fait dans cette
  cause pour cet homme, et j'ai eu le succès le plus complet du monde. Mon
  client était innocent, j'ai fait dramatiquement arrêter les vrais
  coupables qui étaient témoins. Enfin la Cour a partagé l'admiration de
  son public. J'ai su sauver l'amour-propre du juge d'instruction en
  montrant la presque impossibilité de découvrir une trame si bien ourdie.
  J'ai eu la clientèle de mon gros négociant, et je lui ai gagné son
  procès. Le Chapitre de la cathédrale m'a choisi pour avocat dans un
  immense procès avec la Ville qui dure depuis quatre ans: j'ai gagné. En
  trois affaires, je suis devenu le plus grand avocat de la Franche-Comté.
  Mais j'ensevelis ma vie dans le plus profond mystère, et cache ainsi mes
  prétentions. J'ai contracté des habitudes qui me dispensent d'accepter
  toute invitation. On ne peut me consulter que de six heures à huit
  heures du matin, je me couche après mon dîner, et je travaille pendant
  la nuit. Le vicaire-général, homme d'esprit et très-influent, qui m'a
  chargé de l'affaire du Chapitre, déjà perdue en première instance, m'a
  naturellement parlé de reconnaissance.--«Monsieur, lui ai-je dit, je
  gagnerai votre affaire, mais je ne veux pas d'honoraires, je veux
  plus... (haut le corps de l'abbé) sachez que je perds énormément à me
  poser comme l'adversaire de la Ville; je suis venu ici pour en sortir
  député, je ne veux m'occuper que d'affaires commerciales, parce que les
  commerçants font les députés, et ils se défieront de moi si je plaide
  pour _les prêtres_, car vous êtes _les prêtres_ pour eux. Si je me
  charge de votre affaire, c'est que j'étais, en 1828, secrétaire
  particulier à tel Ministère (nouveau mouvement d'étonnement chez mon
  abbé), maître des requêtes sous le nom d'Albert de Savarus (autre
  mouvement). Je suis resté fidèle aux principes monarchiques; mais comme
  vous n'avez pas la majorité dans Besançon, il faut que j'acquière des
  voix dans la bourgeoisie. Donc, les honoraires que je vous demande,
  c'est les voix que vous pourrez faire porter sur moi dans un moment
  opportun, secrètement. Gardons-nous le secret l'un à l'autre, et je
  plaiderai gratis toutes les affaires de tous les prêtres du diocèse. Pas
  un mot de mes antécédents, et soyons-nous fidèles.» Quand il est venu me
  remercier, il m'a remis un billet de cinq cents francs, et m'a dit à
  l'oreille:--Les voix tiennent toujours. En cinq conférences que nous
  avons eues, je me suis fait, je crois, un ami de ce vicaire général.
  Maintenant, accablé d'affaires, je ne me charge que de celles qui
  regardent les négociants, en disant que les questions de commerce sont
  ma spécialité. Cette tactique m'attache les gens de commerce et me
  permet de rechercher les personnes influentes. Ainsi tout va bien. D'ici
  à quelques mois, j'aurai trouvé dans Besançon une maison à acheter qui
  puisse me donner le cens. Je compte sur toi pour me prêter les capitaux
  nécessaires à cette acquisition. Si je mourais, si j'échouais, il n'y
  aurait pas assez de perte pour que ce soit une considération entre nous.
  Les intérêts te seront servis par les loyers, et j'aurai d'ailleurs soin
  d'attendre une bonne occasion, afin que tu ne perdes rien à cette
  hypothèque nécessaire.
  «Ah! mon cher Léopold, jamais joueur, ayant dans sa poche les restes de
  sa fortune, et la jouant au Cercle des Etrangers, dans une dernière nuit
  d'où il doit sortir riche ou ruiné, n'a eu dans les oreilles les
  tintements perpétuels, dans les mains la petite sueur nerveuse, dans la
  tête l'agitation fébrile, dans le corps les tremblements intérieurs que
  j'éprouve tous les jours en jouant ma dernière partie au jeu de
  l'ambition. Hélas! cher et seul ami, voici bientôt dix ans que je lutte.
  Ce combat avec les hommes et les choses, où j'ai sans cesse versé ma
  force et mon énergie, où j'ai tant usé les ressorts du désir, m'a miné,
  pour ainsi dire, intérieurement. Avec les apparences de la force, de la
  santé, je me sens ruiné. Chaque jour emporte un lambeau de ma vie
  intime. A chaque nouvel effort, je sens que je ne pourrai plus le
  recommencer. Je n'ai plus de force et de puissance que pour le bonheur,
  et s'il n'arrivait pas à poser sa couronne de roses sur ma tête, le
  _moi_ que je suis n'existerait plus, je deviendrais une chose détruite,
  je ne désirerais plus rien dans le monde, je ne voudrais plus rien être.
  Tu le sais, le pouvoir et la gloire, cette immense fortune morale que je
  cherche, n'est que secondaire: c'est pour moi le moyen de la félicité,
  le piédestal de mon idole.
  «Atteindre au but en expirant, comme le coureur antique! voir la fortune
  et la mort arrivant ensemble sur le seuil de sa porte! obtenir celle
  qu'on aime au moment où l'amour s'éteint! n'avoir plus la faculté de
  jouir quand on a gagné le droit de vivre heureux!... oh! de combien
  d'hommes ceci fut la destinée!
  «Il y a certes un moment où Tantale s'arrête, se croise les bras, et
  défie l'enfer en renonçant à son métier d'éternel attrapé. J'en serais
  là, si quelque chose faisait manquer mon plan, si, après m'être courbé
  dans la poussière de la province, avoir rampé comme un tigre affamé
  autour de ces négociants, de ces électeurs, pour avoir leurs votes; si,
  après avoir plaidaillé d'arides affaires, avoir donné mon temps, un
  temps que je pourrais passer sur le lac Majeur, à voir les eaux qu'elle
  voit, à me coucher sous ses regards, à l'entendre, je ne m'élançais pas
  à la tribune pour y conquérir l'auréole que doit avoir un nom pour
  succéder à celui d'Argaiolo. Bien plus, Léopold, je sens par certains
  jours des langueurs vaporeuses; il s'élève du fond de mon âme des
  dégoûts mortels, surtout quand, en de longues rêveries, je me suis
  plongé par avance au milieu des joies de l'amour heureux! Le désir
  n'aurait-il en nous qu'une certaine dose de force, et peut-il périr sous
  une trop grande effusion de sa substance? Après tout, en ce moment ma
  vie est belle, éclairée par la foi, par le travail et par l'amour.
  Adieu, mon ami. J'embrasse tes enfants, et tu rappelleras au souvenir de
  ton excellente femme,
  «_Votre_ ALBERT.»
Philomène lut deux fois cette lettre, dont le sens général se grava dans
son coeur. Elle pénétra soudain dans la vie antérieure d'Albert, car sa
vive intelligence lui en expliqua les détails et lui en fit parcourir
l'étendue. En rapprochant cette confidence de la Nouvelle publiée dans
la Revue, elle comprit alors Albert tout entier. Naturellement elle
s'exagéra les proportions déjà fortes de cette belle âme, de cette
volonté puissante; et son amour pour Albert devint alors une passion
dont la violence s'accrut de toute la force de sa jeunesse, des ennuis
de sa solitude et de l'énergie secrète de son caractère. Aimer est déjà
chez une jeune personne un effet de la loi naturelle; mais quand son
besoin d'affection se porte sur un homme extraordinaire, il s'y mêle
l'enthousiasme qui déborde dans les jeunes coeurs. Aussi mademoiselle de
Watteville arriva-t-elle en quelques jours à une phase quasi morbide et
très-dangereuse de l'exaltation amoureuse.
La baronne était très-contente de sa fille, qui, sous l'empire de ses
profondes préoccupations, ne lui résistait plus, paraissait appliquée à
ses divers ouvrages de femme, et réalisait son beau idéal de la fille
soumise.
L'avocat plaidait alors deux ou trois fois par semaine. Quoique accablé
d'affaires, il suffisait au Palais, au contentieux du commerce, à la
Revue, et restait dans un profond mystère en comprenant que plus son
influence serait sourde et cachée, plus réelle elle serait. Mais il ne
négligeait aucun moyen de succès, en étudiant la liste des électeurs
bisontins et recherchant leurs intérêts, leurs caractères, leurs
diverses amitiés, leurs antipathies. Un cardinal voulant être pape
s'est-il jamais donné tant de soin?
Un soir, Mariette, en venant habiller Philomène pour une soirée, lui
apporta, non sans gémir sur cet abus de confiance, une lettre dont la
suscription fit frémir, et pâlir, et rougir mademoiselle de Watteville.
  A MADAME LA DUCHESSE D'ARGAIOLO,
  (_née princesse Soderini_),
  A BELGIRATE,
  _Lac Majeur_.                                      ITALIE.
A ses yeux, cette adresse brilla comme dut briller _Mané_, _Thecel_,
_Pharès_, aux yeux de Balthasar. Après avoir caché la lettre, elle
descendit pour aller avec sa mère chez madame de Chavoncourt. Pendant
cette soirée, Philomène fut assaillie de remords et de scrupules. Elle
avait éprouvé déjà de la honte d'avoir violé le secret de la lettre
d'Albert à Léopold. Elle s'était demandé plusieurs fois si, sachant ce
crime, infâme en ce qu'il est nécessairement impuni, le noble Albert
l'estimerait? Sa conscience lui répondait: Non! avec énergie. Elle avait
expié sa faute en s'imposant des pénitences: elle jeûnait, elle se
mortifiait en restant à genoux les bras en croix, et disant des prières
pendant quelques heures. Elle avait obligé Mariette à ces actes de
repentir. L'ascétisme le plus vrai se mêlait à sa passion, et la rendait
d'autant plus dangereuse.
--Lirai-je? ne lirai-je pas cette lettre? se disait-elle en écoutant les
petites de Chavoncourt. L'une avait seize et l'autre dix-sept ans et
demi. Philomène regardait ses deux amies comme des petites filles, parce
qu'elles n'aimaient pas en secret.
--Si je la lis, se disait-elle après avoir flotté pendant une heure
entre non et oui, ce sera bien certainement la dernière. Puisque j'ai
tant fait que de savoir ce qu'il écrivait à son ami, pourquoi ne
saurais-je pas ce qu'il lui dit _à elle_? Si c'est un horrible crime,
n'est-ce pas une preuve d'amour? O! Albert, ne suis-je pas ta femme?
Quand Philomène fut au lit, elle ouvrit cette lettre, datée de jour en
jour, de manière à offrir à la duchesse une fidèle image de la vie et
des sentiments d'Albert.

  «Ma chère âme, tout va bien. Aux conquêtes que j'ai faites, je viens
  d'en ajouter une précieuse: j'ai rendu service à l'un des personnages
  les plus influents aux élections. Comme les critiques, qui font les
  réputations sans jamais pouvoir s'en faire une, il fait les députés sans
  pouvoir jamais le devenir. Le brave homme a voulu me témoigner sa
  reconnaissance à bon marché, presque sans bourse délier, en me
  disant:--Voulez-vous aller à la Chambre? Je puis vous faire nommer
  député.--Si je me résolvais à entrer dans la carrière politique, lui
  ai-je répondu très-hypocritement, ce serait pour me vouer à la Comté que
  j'aime et où je suis apprécié.--Eh! bien, nous vous déciderons, et nous
  aurons par vous une influence à la Chambre, car vous y brillerez.
  «Ainsi, mon ange aimé, quoi que tu dises, ma persistance aura sa
  couronne. Dans peu, je parlerai du haut de la tribune française à mon
  pays, à l'Europe. Mon nom te sera jeté par les cent voix de la Presse
  française!
  «Oui, comme tu me le dis, je suis venu vieux à Besançon, et Besançon m'a
  vieilli encore; mais, comme Sixte-Quint, je serai jeune le lendemain de
  mon élection. J'entrerai dans ma vraie vie, dans ma sphère. Ne
  serons-nous pas alors sur la même ligne? Le comte Savaron de Savarus,
  ambassadeur je ne sais où, pourra certes épouser une princesse Soderini,
  la veuve du duc d'Argaiolo! Le triomphe rajeunit les hommes conservés
  par d'incessantes luttes. O ma vie! avec quelle joie ai-je sauté de ma
  bibliothèque à mon cabinet, devant ton cher portrait, à qui j'ai dit ces
  progrès avant de t'écrire! Oui, mes voix à moi, celles du vicaire
  général, celles des gens que j'obligerai et celles de ce client,
  assurent déjà mon élection.
  26
  «Nous sommes entrés dans la douzième année, depuis l'heureuse soirée où,
  par un regard, la belle duchesse a ratifié les promesses de la proscrite
  Francesca. Ah! chère, tu as trente-deux ans, et moi j'en ai trente-cinq;
  le cher duc en a soixante dix-sept, c'est-à-dire à lui seul dix ans de
  plus que nous deux, et il continue à se bien porter! Fais-lui mes
  compliments, et dis-lui que je lui donne encore trois ans. J'ai besoin
  de ce temps pour élever ma fortune à la hauteur de ton nom. Tu le vois,
  je suis gai, je ris aujourd'hui: voilà l'effet d'une espérance.
  Tristesse ou gaieté, tout me vient de toi. L'espoir de parvenir me remet
  toujours au lendemain du jour où je t'ai vue pour la première fois, où
  ma vie s'est unie avec la tienne comme la terre à la lumière! _Qual
  pianto_ que ces onze années, car nous voici au vingt-six décembre,
  anniversaire de mon arrivée dans ta _villa_ du lac de Constance. Voici
  onze ans que je crie et que tu rayonnes!
  27
  «Non, chère, ne va pas à Milan, reste à Belgirate. Milan m'épouvante. Je
  n'aime ni ces affreuses habitudes milanaises de causer tous les soirs à
  la Scala avec une douzaine de personnes, parmi lesquelles il est
  difficile qu'on ne te dise pas quelque douceur. Pour moi, la solitude
  est comme ce morceau d'ambre au sein duquel un insecte vit
  éternellement dans son immuable beauté. L'âme et le corps d'une femme
  restent ainsi purs et dans la forme de leur jeunesse. Est-ce ces
  _Tedeschi_ que tu regrettes?
  28
  «Ta statue ne se finira donc point? Je voudrais t'avoir en marbre, en
  peinture, en miniature, de toutes les façons, pour tromper mon
  impatience. J'attends toujours la Vue de Belgirate au midi et celle de
  la galerie, voilà les seules qui me manquent. Je suis tellement occupé,
  que je ne puis aujourd'hui te rien dire qu'un rien, mais ce rien est
  tout. N'est-ce pas d'un rien que Dieu a fait le monde? Ce rien, c'est un
  mot, le mot de Dieu: _Je t'aime!_
  30
  «Ah! je reçois ton journal! Merci de ton exactitude! tu as donc éprouvé
  bien du plaisir à voir les détails de notre première connaissance ainsi
  traduits?... Hélas! tout en les voilant, j'avais grand'peur de
  t'offenser. Nous n'avions point de Nouvelles, et une Revue sans
  Nouvelles, c'est une belle sans cheveux. Peu _trouveur_ de ma nature et
  au désespoir, j'ai pris la seule poésie qui fût dans mon âme, la seule
  aventure qui fût dans mes souvenirs, je l'ai mise au ton où elle pouvait
  être dite, et je n'ai pas cessé de penser à toi tout en écrivant le seul
  morceau littéraire qui sortira de mon coeur, je ne puis pas dire de ma
  plume. La transformation du farouche Sormano en Gina ne t'a-t-elle pas
  fait rire?
  «Tu me demandes comme va la santé? mais bien mieux qu'à Paris. Quoique
  je travaille énormément, la tranquillité des milieux a de l'influence
  sur l'âme. Ce qui fatigue et vieillit, chère ange, c'est ces angoisses
  de vanité trompée, ces irritations perpétuelles de la vie parisienne,
  ces luttes d'ambitions rivales. Le calme est balsamique. Si tu savais
  quel plaisir me fait ta lettre, cette bonne longue lettre où tu me dis
  si bien les moindres accidents de ta vie. Non! vous ne saurez jamais,
  vous autres femmes, à quel point un véritable amant est intéressé par
  ces riens. L'échantillon de ta nouvelle robe m'a fait un énorme plaisir
  à voir! Est-ce donc une chose indifférente que de savoir ta mise? Si
  ton front sublime se raye? Si nos auteurs te distrayent? Si les chants
  de Victor Hugo t'exaltent? Je lis les livres que tu lis. Il n'y a pas
  jusqu'à ta promenade sur le lac qui ne m'ait attendri. Ta lettre est
  belle, suave comme ton âme! O fleur céleste et constamment adorée!
  aurais-je pu vivre sans ces chères lettres qui, depuis onze ans, m'ont
  soutenu dans ma voie difficile, comme une clarté, comme un parfum, comme
  un chant régulier, comme une nourriture divine, comme tout ce qui
  console et charme la vie! Ne manque pas! Si tu savais quelle est mon
  angoisse la veille du jour où je les reçois, et ce qu'un retard d'un
  jour me cause de douleur! Est-elle malade? est-ce _lui_? Je suis entre
  l'enfer et le paradis, je deviens fou! _Cara diva_, cultive toujours la
  musique, exerce ta voix, étudie. Je suis ravi de cette conformité de
  travaux et d'heures qui fait que, séparés par les Alpes, nous vivons
  exactement de la même manière. Cette pensée me charme et me donne bien
  du courage. Quand j'ai plaidé pour la première fois, je ne t'ai pas
  encore dit cela, je me suis figuré que tu m'écoutais, et j'ai senti tout
  à coup en moi ce mouvement d'inspiration qui met le poëte au-dessus de
  l'humanité. Si je vais à la Chambre, oh! tu viendras à Paris pour
  assister à mon début.
  30 au soir.
  «Mon Dieu! combien je t'aime. Hélas! j'ai mis trop de choses dans mon
  amour et dans mes espérances. Un hasard qui ferait chavirer cette barque
  trop chargée emporterait ma vie! Voici trois ans que je ne t'ai vue, et
  à l'idée d'aller à Belgirate, mon coeur bat si fort, que je suis obligé
  de m'arrêter... Te voir, entendre cette voix enfantine et caressante!
  embrasser par les yeux ce teint d'ivoire, si éclatant aux lumières, et
  sous lequel on devine ta noble pensée! admirer tes doigts jouant avec
  les touches, recevoir toute ton âme dans un regard, et ton coeur dans
  l'accent d'un: _Oimé!_ ou d'un: _Alberto!_ nous promener devant tes
  orangers en fleur, vivre quelques mois au sein de ce sublime paysage...
  Voilà la vie. Oh! quelle niaiserie que de courir après le pouvoir, un
  nom, la fortune! Mais tout est à Belgirate: là est la poésie, là est la
  gloire! J'aurais dû me faire ton intendant, ou, comme ce cher tyran que
  nous ne pouvons haïr me le proposait, y vivre en cavalier servant, ce
  que notre ardente passion ne nous a pas permis d'accepter. Est-ce un
  Italien que le duc? m'est avis que c'est le père Eternel! Adieu, mon
  ange, tu me pardonneras mes prochaines tristesses en faveur de cette
  gaieté tombée comme un rayon du flambeau de l'Espérance, qui jusqu'alors
  me paraissait un feu follet.»
--Comme il aime! s'écria Philomène en laissant tomber cette lettre, qui
lui sembla lourde à tenir. Après onze ans, écrire ainsi?
--Mariette, dit Philomène à la femme de chambre, le lendemain matin,
allez jeter cette lettre à la poste; dites à Jérôme que je sais tout ce
que je voulais savoir, et qu'il serve fidèlement monsieur Albert. Nous
nous confesserons de ces péchés sans dire à qui les lettres
appartenaient, ni où elles allaient. J'ai eu tort, c'est moi qui suis la
seule coupable.
--Mademoiselle a pleuré, dit Mariette.
--Oui, je ne voudrais pas que ma mère s'en aperçût; donnez-moi de l'eau
bien froide.
Philomène, au milieu des orages de sa passion, écoutait souvent la voix
de sa conscience. Touchée par cette admirable fidélité de deux coeurs,
elle venait de faire ses prières, et s'était dit qu'elle n'avait plus
qu'à se résigner, à respecter le bonheur de deux êtres dignes l'un de
l'autre, soumis à leur sort, attendant tout de Dieu, sans se permettre
d'actions ni de souhaits criminels. Elle se sentit meilleure, elle
éprouva quelque satisfaction intérieure après avoir pris cette
résolution, inspirée par la droiture naturelle au jeune âge. Elle y fut
encouragée par une réflexion de jeune fille: elle s'immolait pour _lui_!
--Elle ne sait pas aimer, pensa-t-elle. Ah! si c'était moi, je
sacrifierais tout à un homme qui m'aimerait ainsi. Être aimée!... quand
et par qui le serai-je, moi? Ce petit monsieur de Soulas n'aime que ma
fortune; si j'étais pauvre, il ne ferait seulement pas attention à moi.
--Philomène, ma petite, à quoi penses-tu donc? tu vas au delà de la
raie, dit la baronne à sa fille, qui faisait des pantoufles en
tapisserie pour le baron.
Philomène passa tout l'hiver de 1834 à 1835 en mouvements secrets
tumultueux; mais au printemps, au mois d'avril, époque à laquelle elle
atteignit à ses dix-huit ans, elle se disait parfois qu'il serait bien
de l'emporter sur une duchesse d'Argaiolo. Dans le silence et la
solitude, la perspective de cette lutte avait rallumé sa passion et ses
mauvaises pensées. Elle développait par avance sa témérité romanesque en
faisant plans sur plans. Quoique de tels caractères soient
exceptionnels, il existe malheureusement beaucoup trop de Philomènes, et
cette histoire contient une leçon qui doit leur servir d'exemple.
Pendant cet hiver, Albert de Savarus avait sourdement fait un progrès
immense dans Besançon. Sûr de son succès, il attendait avec impatience
la dissolution de la Chambre. Il avait conquis, parmi les hommes du
juste-milieu, l'un des faiseurs de Besançon, un riche entrepreneur qui
disposait d'une grande influence.
Les Romains se sont partout donné des peines énormes, ils ont dépensé
des sommes immenses pour avoir d'excellentes eaux à discrétion dans
toutes les villes de leur empire. A Besançon, ils buvaient les eaux
d'Arcier, montagne située à une assez grande distance de Besançon.
Besançon est une ville assise dans l'intérieur d'un fer à cheval décrit
par le Doubs. Ainsi, rétablir l'aqueduc des Romains pour boire l'eau que
buvaient les Romains dans une ville arrosée par le Doubs, est une de ces
niaiseries qui ne prennent que dans une province où règne la gravité la
plus exemplaire. Si cette fantaisie se logeait au coeur des Bisontins,
elle devait obliger à faire de grandes dépenses, et ces dépenses
allaient profiter à l'homme influent. Albert Savaron de Savarus décida
que le Doubs n'était bon qu'à couler sous des ponts suspendus, et qu'il
n'y avait de potable que l'eau d'Arcier. Des articles parurent dans la
Revue de l'Est, qui ne furent que l'expression des idées du commerce
bisontin. Les Nobles comme les Bourgeois, le Juste-milieu comme les
Légitimistes, le Gouvernement comme l'Opposition, enfin tout le monde se
trouva d'accord pour vouloir boire l'eau des Romains et jouir d'un pont
suspendu. La question des eaux d'Arcier fut à l'ordre du jour dans
Besançon. A Besançon, comme pour les deux chemins de fer de Versailles,
comme pour des abus subsistants, il y eut des intérêts cachés qui
donnèrent une vitalité puissante à cette idée. Les gens raisonnables, en
petit nombre d'ailleurs, qui s'opposaient à ce projet, furent traités de
_ganaches_. On ne s'occupait que des deux plans de l'avocat Savaron.
Après dix-huit mois de travaux souterrains, cet ambitieux était donc
arrivé, dans la ville la plus immobile de France et la plus réfractaire
à l'étranger, à la remuer profondément, à y faire, selon une expression
vulgaire, la pluie et le beau temps, à y exercer une influence positive
sans être sorti de chez lui. Il avait résolu le singulier problème
d'être puissant quelque part sans popularité. Pendant cet hiver, il
gagna sept procès pour des ecclésiastiques de Besançon. Aussi par
moments respirait-il par avance l'air de la Chambre. Son coeur se
gonflait à la pensée de son futur triomphe. Cet immense désir, qui lui
faisait mettre en scène tant d'intérêts, inventer tant de ressorts,
absorbait les dernières forces de son âme démesurément tendue. On
vantait son désintéressement, il acceptait sans observations les
honoraires de ses clients. Mais ce désintéressement était de l'usure
morale, il attendait un prix pour lui plus considérable que tout l'or du
monde. Il avait acheté, soi-disant pour rendre service à un négociant
embarrassé dans ses affaires, au mois d'octobre 1834, et avec les fonds
de Léopold Hannequin, une maison qui lui donnait le cens d'éligibilité.
Ce placement avantageux n'eut pas l'air d'avoir été cherché ni désiré.
--Vous êtes un homme bien réellement remarquable, dit à Savarus l'abbé
de Grancey, qui naturellement observait et devinait l'avocat. Le vicaire
général était venu lui présenter un chanoine qui réclamait les conseils
de l'avocat.--Vous êtes, lui dit-il, un prêtre qui n'est pas dans son
chemin. Un mot qui frappa Savarus.
De son côté, Philomène avait décidé dans sa forte tête de frêle jeune
fille d'amener monsieur de Savarus dans le salon, et de l'introduire
dans la société de l'hôtel de Rupt. Elle bornait encore ses désirs à
voir Albert et à l'entendre. Elle avait transigé, pour ainsi dire, et
les transactions ne sont souvent que des trêves.
Les Rouxey, terre patrimoniale des Watteville, valait dix mille francs
de rente, net; mais en d'autres mains elle eût rapporté bien davantage.
L'insouciance du baron, dont la femme devait avoir et eut quarante mille
francs de revenu, laissait les Rouxey sous le gouvernement d'une espèce
de maître Jacques, un vieux domestique de la maison Watteville, appelé
Modinier. Néanmoins, quand le baron et la baronne éprouvaient le désir
d'aller à la campagne, ils allaient aux Rouxey, dont la situation est
très-pittoresque. Le château, le parc, tout a d'ailleurs été créé par le
fameux Watteville, dont la vieillesse active se passionna pour ce lieu
magnifique.
Entre deux petites Alpes, deux pitons dont le sommet est nu, et qui
s'appellent le grand et le petit Rouxey, au milieu d'une gorge par où
les eaux de ces montagnes, terminées par la Dent de Vilard, tombent et
vont se joindre aux délicieuses sources du Doubs, Watteville imagina de
construire un barrage énorme, en y laissant deux déversoirs pour le
trop-plein des eaux. En amont de son barrage, il obtint un charmant lac,
et en aval deux cascades, deux ravissantes rivières avec lesquelles il
arrosa la sèche et inculte vallée que dévastait jadis le torrent des
Rouxey. Ce lac, cette vallée, ses deux montagnes, il les enferma par une
enceinte, et se bâtit une chartreuse sur le barrage auquel il donna
trois arpents de largeur, en y faisant apporter toutes les terres qu'il
fallut enlever pour creuser le double lit de ses rivières factices et
les canaux d'irrigation. Quand le baron de Watteville se procura le lac
au-dessus de son barrage, il était propriétaire des deux Rouxey, mais
non de la vallée supérieure qu'il inondait ainsi, par laquelle on
passait en tout temps, et qui se termine en fer à cheval au pied de la
Dent de Vilard. Mais ce sauvage vieillard imprimait une si grande
terreur que, pendant toute sa vie, il n'y eut aucune réclamation de la
part des habitants des Riceys, petit village situé sur le revers de la
Dent de Vilard. Quand le baron mourut, il avait réuni les pentes des
deux Rouxey, au pied de la Dent de Vilard par une forte muraille, afin
de ne pas inonder les deux vallées qui débouchaient dans la gorge des
Rouxey à droite et à gauche du pic de Vilard. Il mourut ayant conquis
ainsi la Dent de Vilard. Ses héritiers se firent les protecteurs du
village des Riceys et maintinrent ainsi l'usurpation. Le vieux
meurtrier, le vieux renégat, le vieil abbé Watteville avait fini sa
carrière en plantant des arbres, en construisant une superbe route,
prise sur le flanc d'un des deux Rouxey, et qui rejoignait le grand
chemin. De ce parc, de cette habitation dépendaient des domaines fort
mal cultivés, des chalets dans les deux montagnes et des bois
inexploités. C'était sauvage et solitaire, sous la garde de la nature,
abandonné au hasard de la végétation, mais plein d'accidents sublimes.
Vous pouvez vous figurer maintenant les Rouxey.
Il est fort inutile d'embarrasser cette histoire en racontant les
prodigieux efforts et les ruses empreintes de génie par lesquels
Philomène arriva, sans le laisser soupçonner, à son but. Qu'il suffise
de dire qu'elle obéissait à sa mère en quittant Besançon au mois de mai
1835, dans une vieille berline attelée de deux bons gros chevaux loués,
et allant avec son père aux Rouxey.
L'amour explique tout aux jeunes filles. Quand en se levant, le
lendemain de son arrivée aux Rouxey, Philomène aperçut de la fenêtre de
sa chambre la belle nappe d'eau sur laquelle s'élevaient de ces vapeurs
exhalées comme des fumées et qui s'engageaient dans les sapins et dans
les mélèzes, en rampant le long des deux pics pour en gagner les
sommets, elle laissa échapper un cri d'admiration.
--_Ils_ se sont aimés devant des lacs! _Elle_ est sur un lac! Décidément
un lac est plein d'amour.
Un lac alimenté par des neiges a des couleurs d'opale et une
transparence qui en fait un vaste diamant; mais quand il est serré comme
celui des Rouxey entre deux blocs de granit vêtus de sapins, qu'il y
règne un silence de savane ou de steppe, il arrache à tout le monde le
cri que venait de jeter Philomène.
--On doit cela, lui dit son père, au fameux Watteville!
--Ma foi, dit la jeune fille, il a voulu se faire pardonner ses fautes.
Montons dans la barque et allons jusqu'au bout, dit-elle; nous gagnerons
de l'appétit pour le déjeuner.
Le baron manda deux jeunes jardiniers qui savaient ramer, et prit avec
lui son premier ministre Modinier. Le lac avait six arpents de largeur,
quelquefois dix ou douze, et quatre cents arpents de long. Philomène eut
bientôt atteint le fond qui se termine par la Dent de Vilard, la
Jung-Frau de cette petite Suisse.
--Nous y voilà, monsieur le baron, dit Modinier en faisant signe aux
deux jardiniers d'attacher la barque; voulez-vous venir voir...
--Voir quoi? demanda Philomène.
--Oh! rien, dit le baron. Mais tu es une fille discrète, nous avons des
secrets ensemble, je puis te dire ce qui me chiffonne l'esprit: il s'est
ému depuis 1830 des difficultés entre la commune des Riceys et moi,
précisément à cause de la Dent du Vilard, et je voudrais les accommoder
sans que ta mère le sache, car elle est entière, elle est capable de
jeter feu et flammes, surtout en apprenant que le maire des Riceys, un
républicain, a inventé cette contestation pour courtiser son peuple.
Philomène eut le courage de déguiser sa joie, afin de mieux agir sur son
père.
--Quelle contestation? fit-elle.
--Mademoiselle, les gens des Riceys, dit Modinier, ont depuis longtemps
droit de pâture et d'affouage dans leur côté de la Dent de Vilard. Or,
monsieur Chantonnit, leur maire depuis 1830, prétend que la Dent tout
entière appartient à sa commune, et soutient qu'il y a cent et quelques
années on passait sur nos terres... Vous comprenez qu'alors nous ne
serions plus chez nous. Puis ce sauvage en viendrait à dire, ce que
disent les anciens des Riceys, que le terrain du lac a été pris par
l'abbé de Watteville. C'est la mort des Rouxey, quoi!
--Hélas! mon enfant, entre nous c'est vrai, dit naïvement monsieur de
Watteville. Cette terre est une usurpation consacrée par le temps.
Aussi, pour n'être jamais tourmenté, je voudrais proposer de définir à
l'amiable mes limites de ce côté de la Dent de Vilard, et j'y bâtirais
un mur.
--Si vous cédez devant la république, elle vous dévorera. C'était à vous
de menacer les Riceys.
--C'est ce que je disais hier au soir à monsieur, répondit Modinier.
Mais, pour abonder dans ce sens, je lui proposais de venir voir s'il n'y
avait pas, de ce côté de la Dent ou de l'autre, à une hauteur
quelconque, des traces de clôture.
Depuis cent ans, de part et d'autre on exploitait la Dent de Vilard,
cette espèce de mur mitoyen entre la commune des Riceys et les Rouxey,
qui ne rapportait pas grand'chose, sans en venir à des moyens extrêmes.
L'objet en litige, étant couvert de neige six mois de l'année, était de
nature à refroidir la question. Aussi fallut-il l'ardeur soufflée par la
révolution de 1830 aux défenseurs du peuple, pour réveiller cette
affaire par laquelle monsieur Chantonnit, maire des Riceys, voulait
dramatiser son existence sur la tranquille frontière de Suisse et
immortaliser son administration. Chantonnit, comme son nom l'indique,
était originaire de Neufchâtel.
--Mon cher père, dit Philomène en rentrant dans la barque, j'approuve
Modinier. Si vous voulez obtenir la mitoyenneté de la Dent de Vilard, il
est nécessaire d'agir avec vigueur, et d'obtenir un jugement qui vous
mette à l'abri des entreprises de ce Chantonnit. Pourquoi donc
auriez-vous peur? Prenez pour avocat le fameux Savaron, prenez-le
promptement pour que Chantonnit ne le charge pas des intérêts de sa
commune. Celui qui a gagné la cause du Chapitre contre la Ville, gagnera
bien celle des Watteville contre les Riceys! D'ailleurs, dit-elle, les
Rouxey seront un jour à moi (le plus tard possible, je l'espère), eh!
bien, ne me laissez pas de procès. J'aime cette terre, et je l'habiterai
souvent, je l'augmenterai tant que je pourrai. Sur ces rives, dit-elle
en montrant les bases des deux Rouxey, je découperai des corbeilles,
j'en ferai des jardins anglais ravissants... Allons à Besançon, et ne
revenons ici qu'avec l'abbé de Grancey, monsieur Savaron et ma mère, si
elle le veut. C'est alors que vous pourrez prendre un parti; mais à
votre place je l'aurais déjà pris. Vous vous nommez Watteville, et vous
avez peur d'une lutte! Si vous perdez le procès.... tenez, je ne vous
dirai pas un mot de reproche.
--Oh! si tu le prends ainsi, dit le baron, je le veux bien, je verrai
l'avocat.
--D'ailleurs un procès, mais c'est très-amusant. Il jette un intérêt
dans la vie, l'on va, l'on vient, l'on se démène. N'aurez-vous pas mille
démarches à faire pour arriver aux juges... Nous n'avons pas vu l'abbé
de Grancey pendant plus de vingt jours, tant il était occupé!
--Mais il s'agissait de toute l'existence du Chapitre, dit monsieur de
Watteville. Puis, l'amour-propre, la conscience de l'archevêque, tout ce
qui fait vivre les prêtres y était engagé! Ce Savaron ne sait pas ce
qu'il a fait pour le Chapitre! il l'a sauvé.
--Ecoutez-moi, lui dit-elle à l'oreille, si vous avez monsieur Savaron
pour vous, vous aurez gagné, n'est-ce pas? Eh! bien, laissez-moi vous
donner un conseil: vous ne pouvez avoir monsieur Savaron pour vous que
par monsieur de Grancey. Si vous m'en croyez, parlons ensemble à ce cher
abbé, sans que ma mère soit de la conférence, car je sais un moyen de le
décider à nous amener l'avocat Savaron.
--Il sera bien difficile de n'en pas parler à ta mère!
--L'abbé de Grancey s'en chargera plus tard; mais décidez-vous à
promettre votre voix à l'avocat Savaron aux prochaines élections, et
vous verrez!
--Aller aux élections! prêter serment! s'écria le baron de Watteville.
--Bah! dit elle.
--Et que dira ta mère?
--Elle vous ordonnera peut-être d'y aller, répondit Philomène qui savait
par la lettre d'Albert à Léopold les engagements du vicaire général.
Quatre jours après, l'abbé de Grancey se glissait un matin de très-bonne
heure chez Albert de Savarus, après l'avoir prévenu la veille de sa
visite. Le vieux prêtre venait conquérir le grand avocat à la maison
Watteville, démarche qui révèle le tact et la finesse que Philomène
avait souterrainement déployés.
--Que puis-je pour vous, monsieur le vicaire-général? dit Savarus.
L'abbé, qui dégoisa l'affaire avec une admirable bonhomie, fut écouté
froidement par Albert.
--Monsieur l'abbé, répondit-il, il m'est impossible de me charger des
intérêts de la maison Watteville, et vous allez comprendre pourquoi. Mon
rôle ici consiste à garder la plus exacte neutralité. Je ne veux pas
prendre couleur, et dois rester une énigme jusqu'à la veille de mon
élection. Or, plaider pour les Watteville, ce ne serait rien à Paris;
mais ici!... Ici où tout se commente, je serais pour tout le monde
l'homme de votre faubourg Saint-Germain.
--Eh! croyez-vous, dit l'abbé, que vous pourrez être inconnu, quand, au
jour des élections, les candidats s'attaqueront? Mais alors on saura que
vous vous nommez Savaron de Savarus, que vous avez été maître des
requêtes, que vous êtes un homme de la Restauration!
--Au jour des élections, dit Savarus, je serai tout ce qu'il faudra que
je sois. Je compte parler dans les réunions préparatoires...
--Si monsieur de Watteville et son parti vous appuyait, vous auriez cent
voix compactes et un peu plus sûres que celles sur lesquelles vous
comptez. On peut toujours semer la division entre les intérêts, on ne
sépare point les Convictions.
--Eh! diable, reprit Savarus, je vous aime et puis faire beaucoup pour
vous, mon père! Peut-être y a-t-il des accommodements avec le diable.
Quel que soit le procès de monsieur de Watteville, on peut, en prenant
Girardet et le guidant, traîner la procédure jusqu'après les élections.
Je ne me chargerai de plaider que le lendemain de mon élection.
--Faites une chose, dit l'abbé, venez à l'hôtel de Rupt; il s'y trouve
une petite personne de dix-huit ans qui doit avoir un jour cent mille
livres de rentes, et vous paraîtrez lui faire la cour...
--Ah! cette jeune fille que je vois souvent sur ce kiosque...
--Oui, mademoiselle Philomène, reprit l'abbé de Grancey. Vous êtes
ambitieux. Si vous lui plaisiez, vous seriez tout ce qu'un ambitieux
veut être: ministre. On est toujours ministre, quand à une fortune de
cent mille livres de rentes on joint vos étonnantes capacités.
--Monsieur l'abbé, dit vivement Albert, mademoiselle de Watteville
aurait encore trois fois plus de fortune et m'adorerait, qu'il me serait
impossible de l'épouser...
--Vous seriez marié? fit l'abbé de Grancey.
--Non pas à l'église, non pas à la mairie, dit Savarus, mais moralement.
--C'est pire quand on y tient autant que vous paraissez y tenir,
répondit l'abbé. Tout ce qui n'est pas fait, peut se défaire. N'asseyez
pas plus votre fortune et vos plans sur un vouloir de femme, qu'un homme
sage ne compte sur les souliers d'un mort pour se mettre en route.
--Laissons mademoiselle de Watteville, dit gravement Albert, et
convenons de nos faits. A cause de vous, que j'aime et respecte, je
plaiderai, mais après les élections, pour monsieur de Watteville.
Jusque-là, son affaire sera conduite par Girardet d'après mes avis.
Voilà tout ce que je puis faire.
--Mais il y a des questions qui ne peuvent se décider que d'après une
inspection des localités, dit le vicaire général.
--Girardet ira, répondit Savarus. Je ne veux pas me permettre, au milieu
d'une ville que je connais très-bien, une démarche de nature à
compromettre les immenses intérêts que cache mon élection.
L'abbé de Grancey quitta Savarus en lui lançant un regard fin par lequel
il semblait se rire de la politique compacte du jeune athlète, tout en
admirant sa résolution.
--Ah! j'aurai jeté mon père dans un procès! ah! j'aurai tant fait pour
l'introduire ici! se disait Philomène du haut du kiosque en regardant
l'avocat dans son cabinet, le lendemain de la conférence entre Albert et
l'abbé de Grancey, dont le résultat lui fut dit par son père. J'aurai
commis des péchés mortels, et tu ne viendrais pas dans le salon de
l'hôtel de Rupt, et je n'entendrais pas ta voix si riche? Tu mets des
conditions à ton concours quand les Watteville et les Rupt le
demandent!... Eh! bien, Dieu le sait, je me contentais de ces petits
bonheurs: te voir, t'entendre, aller aux Rouxey avec toi pour me les
faire consacrer par ta présence. Je ne voulais pas davantage... Mais
maintenant je serai ta femme!... Oui, oui, regarde _ses_ portraits,
examine _ses_ salons, _sa_ chambre, les quatre faces de _sa_ villa, les
points de vue de _ses_ jardins. Tu attends _sa_ statue! je _la_ rendrai
de marbre elle-même pour toi!... Cette femme n'aime pas d'ailleurs. Les
arts, les sciences, les lettres, le chant, la musique, lui ont pris la
moitié de ses sens et de son intelligence. Elle est vieille d'ailleurs,
elle a plus de trente ans, et mon Albert serait malheureux!
--Qu'avez-vous donc à rester là, Philomène? lui dit sa mère en venant
troubler les réflexions de sa fille. Monsieur de Soulas est au salon, et
il remarquait votre attitude qui, certes, annonçait plus de pensées
qu'on ne doit en avoir à votre âge.
--Monsieur de Soulas est ennemi de la pensée? demanda-t-elle.
--Vous pensiez donc? dit madame de Watteville.
--Mais oui, maman.
--Eh! bien, non, vous ne pensiez pas. Vous regardiez les fenêtres de cet
avocat; occupation qui n'est ni convenable ni décente, et que monsieur
de Soulas moins qu'un autre devait remarquer.
--Eh! pourquoi? dit Philomène.
--Mais dit la baronne, il est temps que vous sachiez nos intentions:
Amédée vous trouve bien, et vous ne serez pas malheureuse d'être
comtesse de Soulas.
Pâle comme un lis, Philomène ne répondit rien à sa mère, tant la
violence de ses sentiments contrariés la rendit stupide. Mais en
présence de cet homme qu'elle haïssait profondément depuis un instant,
elle trouva je ne sais quel sourire que trouvent les danseuses pour le
public. Enfin elle put rire, elle eut la force de cacher sa fureur qui
se calma, car elle résolut d'employer à ses desseins ce gros et niais
jeune homme.
--Monsieur Amédée, lui dit-elle pendant un moment où la baronne était en
avant d'eux dans le jardin en affectant de laisser les jeunes gens
seuls, vous ignoriez donc que monsieur Albert Savaron de Savarus est
légitimiste?
--Légitimiste?
--Avant 1830, il était maître des requêtes au conseil d'état, attaché à
la présidence du conseil des ministres, bien vu du Dauphin et de la
Dauphine. Il eût été bien à vous de ne pas dire du mal de lui; mais il
serait encore mieux d'aller aux Élections cette année, de le porter et
d'empêcher ce pauvre monsieur de Chavoncourt de représenter la ville de
Besançon.
--Quel intérêt subit prenez-vous donc à ce Savaron?
--Monsieur Albert de Savarus, fils naturel du comte de Savarus (oh!
gardez-moi bien le secret sur cette indiscrétion), s'il est nommé
député, sera notre avocat dans l'affaire des Rouxey. Les Rouxey, m'a dit
mon père, seront ma propriété, j'y veux demeurer, c'est ravissant! Je
serais au désespoir de voir cette magnifique création du grand
Watteville détruite...
--Diantre! se dit Amédée en sortant de l'hôtel de Rupt, cette fille
n'est pas sotte.
Monsieur de Chavoncourt est un royaliste qui appartient aux fameux
Deux-Cent-Vingt-et-Un. Aussi, dès le lendemain de la révolution de
juillet, prêcha-t-il la salutaire doctrine de la prestation du serment
et de la lutte avec l'Ordre de choses à l'instar des _torys_ contre les
_whigs_ en Angleterre. Cette doctrine ne fut pas accueillie par les
Légitimistes qui, dans la défaite, eurent l'esprit de se diviser
d'opinions et de s'en tenir à la force d'inertie et à la Providence. En
butte à la défiance de son parti, monsieur de Chavoncourt parut aux gens
du Juste-Milieu le plus excellent choix à faire; ils préférèrent le
triomphe de ses opinions modérées à l'ovation d'un républicain qui
réunissait les voix des exaltés et des patriotes. Monsieur de
Chavoncourt, homme très-estimé dans Besançon, représentait une vieille
famille parlementaire: sa fortune, d'environ quinze mille francs de
rente, ne choquait personne, d'autant plus qu'il avait un fils et trois
filles. Quinze mille francs de rente ne sont rien avec de pareilles
charges. Or, lorsqu'en de semblables circonstances, un père de famille
reste incorruptible, il est difficile que des électeurs ne l'estiment
pas. Les électeurs se passionnent pour le beau idéal de la vertu
parlementaire, tout autant qu'un parterre pour la peinture de sentiments
généreux qu'il pratique très-peu. Madame de Chavoncourt, alors âgée de
quarante ans, était une des belles femmes de Besançon. Pendant les
sessions, elle vivait petitement dans un de ses domaines afin de
retrouver par ses économies les dépenses que faisait à Paris monsieur de
Chavoncourt. En hiver, elle recevait honorablement un jour par semaine,
le mardi; mais en entendant très-bien son métier de maîtresse de maison.
Le jeune Chavoncourt, âgé de vingt-deux ans, et un autre jeune
gentilhomme, nommé monsieur de Vauchelles, pas plus riche qu'Amédée, et
de plus son camarade de collége, étaient excessivement liés. Ils se
promenaient ensemble à Granvelle, ils faisaient quelques parties de
chasse ensemble; ils étaient si connus pour être inséparables qu'on les
invitait à la campagne ensemble. Philomène, également liée avec les
petites Chavoncourt, savait que ces trois jeunes gens n'avaient point
de secrets les uns pour les autres. Elle se dit que si monsieur de
Soulas commettait une indiscrétion, ce serait avec ses deux amis
intimes. Or, monsieur de Vauchelles avait son plan fait pour son mariage
comme Amédée pour le sien: il voulait épouser Victoire, l'aînée des
petites Chavoncourt, à laquelle une vieille tante devait assurer un
domaine de sept mille francs de rente et cent mille francs d'argent au
contrat. Victoire était la filleule et la prédilection de cette tante.
Évidemment alors le jeune Chavoncourt et Vauchelles avertiraient
monsieur de Chavoncourt du péril que les prétentions d'Albert allaient
lui faire courir. Mais ce ne fut pas assez pour Philomène, elle écrivit
de la main gauche au préfet du département une lettre anonyme signée _un
ami de Louis-Philippe_, où elle le prévenait de la candidature tenue
secrète de monsieur Albert de Savarus, en lui faisant apercevoir le
dangereux concours qu'un orateur royaliste prêterait à Berryer, et lui
dévoilant la profondeur de la conduite tenue par l'avocat depuis deux
ans à Besançon. Le préfet était un homme habile, ennemi personnel du
parti royaliste, et dévoué par conviction au gouvernement de juillet,
enfin un de ces hommes qui font dire, rue de Grenelle, au Ministère de
l'Intérieur:--Nous avons un bon préfet à Besançon. Ce préfet lut la
lettre, et, selon la recommandation, il la brûla.
Philomène voulait faire manquer l'élection d'Albert pour le conserver
pendant cinq autres années à Besançon.
Les Élections furent alors une lutte entre les partis, et pour en
triompher, le Ministère choisit son terrain en choisissant le moment de
la lutte. Ainsi les Élections ne devaient avoir lieu qu'à trois mois de
là. Quand un homme attend toute sa vie d'une élection, le temps qui
s'écoule entre l'ordonnance de convocation des colléges électoraux et le
jour fixé pour leurs opérations, est un temps pendant lequel la vie
ordinaire est suspendue. Aussi Philomène comprit-elle combien de
latitude lui laissaient pendant ces trois mois les préoccupations
d'Albert. Elle obtint de Mariette, à qui, comme elle l'avoua plus tard,
elle promit de la prendre ainsi que Jérôme à son service, de lui
remettre les lettres qu'Albert enverrait en Italie et les lettres qui
viendraient pour lui de ce pays. Et tout en machinant ces plans, cette
étonnante fille faisait des pantoufles à son père de l'air le plus naïf
du monde. Elle redoubla même de candeur et d'innocence en comprenant à
quoi pouvait servir son air d'innocence et de candeur.
--Philomène devient charmante, disait la baronne de Watteville.
Deux mois avant les élections, une réunion eut lieu chez monsieur
Boucher le père, composée de l'entrepreneur qui comptait sur les travaux
du pont et des eaux d'Arcier, du beau-père de monsieur Boucher, de
monsieur Granet, cet homme influent à qui Savarus avait rendu service et
qui devait le proposer comme candidat, de l'avoué Girardet, de
l'imprimeur de la Revue de l'Est et du président du tribunal de
commerce. Enfin cette réunion compta vingt-sept de ces personnes
appelées dans les provinces _les gros bonnets_. Chacune d'elles
représentait en moyenne six voix; mais en les recensant, elles furent
portées à dix, car on commence toujours par s'exagérer à soi-même son
influence. Parmi ces vingt-sept personnes, le préfet en avait une à lui,
quelque faux-frère qui secrètement attendait une faveur du Ministère
pour les siens ou pour lui-même. Dans cette première réunion, on convint
de choisir l'avocat Savaron pour candidat, avec un enthousiasme que
personne n'aurait pu espérer à Besançon. En attendant chez lui qu'Alfred
Boucher vînt le chercher, Albert causait avec l'abbé de Grancey qui
s'intéressait à cette immense ambition. Albert avait reconnu l'énorme
capacité politique du prêtre, et le prêtre ému par les prières de ce
jeune homme, avait bien voulu lui servir de guide et de conseil dans
cette lutte suprême. Le Chapitre n'aimait pas monsieur de Chavoncourt:
car le beau-frère de sa femme, président du tribunal, avait fait perdre
le fameux procès en première instance.
--Vous êtes trahi, mon cher enfant, lui disait le fin et respectable
abbé de cette voix douce et calme que se font les vieux prêtres.
--Trahi!... s'écria l'amoureux atteint au coeur.
--Et par qui, je n'en sais rien, répliqua le prêtre. La Préfecture est
au fait de vos plans et lit dans votre jeu. Je ne puis vous donner en ce
moment aucun conseil. De semblables affaires veulent être étudiées.
Quant à ce soir, dans cette réunion, allez au-devant des coups qu'on va
vous porter. Dites toute votre vie antérieure, vous atténuerez ainsi
l'effet que cette découverte produirait sur les Bisontins.
--Oh! je m'y suis attendu, dit Savarus d'une voix altérée.
--Vous n'avez pas voulu profiter de mon conseil, vous avez eu l'occasion
de vous produire à l'hôtel de Rupt, vous ne savez pas ce que vous y
auriez gagné...
--Quoi?
--L'unanimité des royalistes, un accord momentané pour aller aux
Élections... Enfin, plus de cent voix! En y joignant ce que nous
appelons entre nous les _voix ecclésiastiques_ vous n'étiez pas encore
nommé; mais vous étiez maître de l'élection par le ballottage. Dans ce
cas, on parlemente, on arrive...
En entrant, Alfred Boucher, qui plein d'enthousiasme annonça le voeu de
la réunion préparatoire, trouva le vicaire-général et l'avocat froids,
calmes et graves.
--Adieu, monsieur l'abbé, dit Albert, nous causerons plus à fond de
votre affaire après les Élections.
Et l'avocat prit le bras d'Alfred, après avoir serré significativement
la main de monsieur de Grancey. Le prêtre regarda cet ambitieux, dont
alors le visage eut cet air sublime que doivent avoir les généraux en
entendant le premier coup de canon de la bataille. Il leva les yeux au
ciel et sortit en se disant:--Quel beau prêtre il ferait!
L'éloquence n'est pas au barreau. Rarement l'avocat y déploie les forces
réelles de l'âme, autrement il y périrait en quelques années.
L'éloquence est rarement dans la Chaire aujourd'hui; mais elle est dans
certaines séances de la Chambre des Députés où l'ambitieux joue le tout
pour le tout, où piqué de milles flèches il éclate à un moment donné.
Mais elle est encore bien certainement chez certains êtres privilégiés
dans le quart d'heure fatal où leurs prétentions vont échouer ou
réussir, et où ils sont forcés de parler. Aussi dans cette réunion,
Albert Savarus, en sentant la nécessité de se faire des séides,
développa-t-il toutes les facultés de son âme et les ressources de son
esprit. Il entra bien dans le salon, sans gaucherie ni arrogance, sans
faiblesse, sans lâcheté, gravement, et se vit sans surprise au milieu de
trente et quelques personnes. Déjà le bruit de la réunion et sa décision
avaient amené quelques moutons dociles à la clochette. Avant d'écouter
monsieur Boucher qui voulait lui lâcher un _speech_ à propos de la
résolution du Comité-Boucher, Albert réclama le silence en faisant un
signe et serrant la main à monsieur Boucher, comme pour le prévenir d'un
danger subitement advenu.
--Mon jeune ami, Alfred Boucher vient de m'annoncer l'honneur qui m'est
fait. Mais avant que cette décision devienne définitive, dit l'avocat,
je crois devoir vous expliquer quel est votre candidat, afin de vous
laisser libres encore de reprendre vos paroles si mes déclarations
troublaient vos consciences.
Cet exorde eut pour effet de faire régner un profond silence. Quelques
hommes trouvèrent ce mouvement fort noble.
Albert expliqua sa vie antérieure en disant son vrai nom, ses oeuvres
sous la Restauration, en se faisant un homme nouveau depuis son arrivée
à Besançon, en prenant des engagements pour l'avenir. Cette
improvisation tint, dit-on, tous les auditeurs haletants. Ces hommes à
intérêts si divers furent subjugués par l'admirable éloquence sortie
bouillante du coeur et de l'âme de cet ambitieux. L'admiration empêcha
toute réflexion. On ne comprit qu'une seule chose, la chose qu'Albert
voulait jeter dans ces têtes.
Ne valait-il pas mieux pour une ville avoir un de ces hommes destinés à
gouverner la société toute entière, qu'une machine à voter? Un homme
d'état apporte tout un pouvoir, le député médiocre mais incorruptible
n'est qu'une conscience. Quelle gloire pour la Provence d'avoir deviné
Mirabeau, d'avoir envoyé depuis 1830 le seul homme d'État qu'ait produit
la révolution de Juillet!
Soumis à la pression de cette éloquence, tous les auditeurs la crurent
de force à devenir un magnifique instrument politique dans leur
représentant. Ils virent tous Savarus le ministre dans Albert Savaron.
En devinant les secrets calculs de ses auditeurs, l'habile candidat leur
fit entendre qu'ils acquéraient, eux les premiers, le droit de se servir
de son influence.
Cette profession de foi, cette déclaration d'ambitieux, ce récit de sa
vie et de son caractère fut, au dire du seul homme capable de juger
Savarus et qui depuis est devenu l'une des capacités de Besançon, un
chef-d'oeuvre d'adresse, de sentiment, de chaleur, d'intérêt et de
séduction. Ce tourbillon enveloppa les électeurs. Jamais homme n'eut un
pareil triomphe. Mais malheureusement la Parole, espèce d'arme à bout
portant, n'a qu'un effet immédiat. La Réflexion tue la Parole quand la
Parole n'a pas triomphé de la Réflexion. Si l'on eût voté, certes le nom
d'Albert sortait de l'urne! A l'instant même il était vainqueur. Mais il
lui fallait vaincre ainsi tous les jours pendant deux mois. Albert
sortit palpitant. Applaudi par des Bisontins, il avait obtenu le grand
résultat de tuer par avance les méchants propos auxquels donneraient
lieu ses antécédents. Le commerce de Besançon fit de l'avocat Savaron de
Savarus son candidat. L'enthousiasme d'Alfred Boucher, contagieux
d'abord, devait à la longue devenir maladroit.
Le préfet, épouvanté de ce succès, se mit à compter le nombre des voix
ministérielles, et sut se ménager une entrevue secrète avec monsieur de
Chavoncourt, afin de se coaliser dans l'intérêt commun. Chaque jour, et
sans qu'Albert pût savoir comment, les voix du Comité-Boucher
diminuèrent. Un mois avant les Élections, Albert se voyait à peine
soixante voix. Rien ne résistait au lent travail de la Préfecture. Trois
ou quatre hommes habiles disaient aux clients de Savarus: «Le député
plaidera-t-il et gagnera-t-il vos affaires? vous donnera-t-il ses
conseils, fera-t-il vos traités, vos transactions? Vous l'aurez pour
esclave encore pour cinq ans, si au lieu de l'envoyer à la Chambre, vous
lui donnez seulement l'espérance d'y aller dans cinq ans.» Ce calcul fut
d'autant plus nuisible à Savarus, que déjà quelques femmes de négociants
l'avaient fait. Les intéressés à l'affaire du pont et ceux des eaux
d'Arcier ne résistèrent pas à une conférence avec un adroit ministériel,
qui leur prouva que la protection pour eux était à la Préfecture et non
pas chez un ambitieux. Chaque jour fut une défaite pour Albert, quoique
chaque jour fût une bataille dirigée par lui, mais jouée par ses
lieutenants, une bataille de mots, de discours, de démarches. Il n'osait
aller chez le vicaire-général, et le vicaire-général ne se montrait pas.
Albert se levait et se couchait avec la fièvre et le cerveau tout en
feu.
Enfin arriva le jour de la première lutte, ce qu'on appelle une réunion
préparatoire, où les voix se comptent, où les candidats jugent leurs
chances, et où les gens habiles peuvent prévoir la chute ou le succès.
C'est une scène de _hustings_ honnête, sans populace, mais terrible: les
émotions, pour ne pas avoir d'expression physique comme en Angleterre,
n'en sont pas moins profondes. Les Anglais font les choses à coups de
poings, en France elles se font à coups de phrases. Nos voisins ont une
bataille, les Français jouent leur sort par de froides combinaisons
élaborées avec calme. Cet acte politique se passe à l'inverse du
caractère des deux nations. Le parti radical eut son candidat, monsieur
de Chavoncourt se présenta, puis vint Albert qui fut accusé par les
radicaux et par le Comité-Chavoncourt d'être un homme de la Droite sans
transaction, un double de Berryer. Le Ministère avait son candidat, un
homme sacrifié qui servait à masser les votes ministériels purs. Les
voix ainsi divisées n'arrivèrent à aucun résultat. Le candidat
républicain eut vingt voix, le Ministère en réunit cinquante, Albert en
compta soixante-dix, monsieur de Chavoncourt en obtint soixante-sept.
Mais la perfide Préfecture avait fait voter pour Albert trente de ses
voix les plus dévouées, afin d'abuser son antagoniste. Les voix de
monsieur de Chavoncourt, réunies aux quatre-vingts voix réelles de la
préfecture, devenaient maîtresses de l'élection pour peu que le préfet
sût détacher quelques voix du parti radical. Cent soixante voix
manquaient, les voix de monsieur de Grancey, et les voix légitimistes.
Une réunion préparatoire est aux Élections ce qu'est au Théâtre une
répétition générale, ce qu'il y a de plus trompeur au monde. Albert
Savarus revint chez lui, faisant bonne contenance, mais mourant. Il
avait eu l'esprit, le génie, ou le bonheur de conquérir dans ces quinze
derniers jours deux hommes dévoués, le beau-père de Girardet et un vieux
négociant très-fin chez qui l'envoya monsieur de Grancey. Ces deux
braves gens, devenus ses espions, semblaient être les plus ardents
ennemis de Savarus dans les camps opposés. Sur la fin de la séance
préparatoire, ils apprirent à Savarus par l'intermédiaire de monsieur
Boucher que trente voix inconnues faisaient contre lui, dans son parti,
le métier qu'ils faisaient pour son compte chez les autres? Un criminel
qui marche au supplice ne souffre pas ce qu'Albert souffrit en revenant
chez lui de la salle où son sort s'était joué. L'amoureux au désespoir
ne voulut être accompagné de personne. Il marcha seul par les rues,
entre onze heures et minuit.
A une heure du matin, Albert, que depuis trois jours le sommeil ne
visitait plus, était assis dans sa bibliothèque, sur un fauteuil à la
Voltaire, la tête pâle comme s'il allait expirer, les mains pendantes,
dans une pose d'abandon digne de la Magdeleine. Des larmes roulaient
entre ses longs cils, de ces larmes qui mouillent les yeux et qui ne
roulent pas sur les joues: la pensée les boit, le feu de l'âme les
dévore! Seul, il pouvait pleurer. Il aperçut alors sous le kiosque une
forme blanche qui lui rappela Francesca.
--Et voici trois mois que je n'ai reçu de lettre d'_elle_! Que
devient-elle? je suis resté deux mois sans lui rien écrire, mais je l'ai
prévenue. Est-elle malade? O mon amour! ô ma vie! sauras-tu jamais ce
que j'ai souffert? Quelle fatale organisation est la mienne! Ai-je un
anévrisme? se demanda-t-il en sentant son coeur qui battait si
violemment que les pulsations retentissaient dans le silence comme si de
légers grains de sable eussent frappé sur une grosse caisse.
En ce moment trois coups discrets retentirent à la porte d'Albert, il
alla promptement ouvrir, et faillit se trouver mal de joie en voyant au
vicaire-général un air gai, l'air du triomphe. Il saisit l'abbé de
Grancey, sans lui dire un mot, le tint dans ses bras, le serra, laissant
aller sa tête sur l'épaule de ce vieillard. Et il redevint enfant, il
pleura comme il avait pleuré quand il sut que Francesca Soderini était
mariée. Il ne laissa voir sa faiblesse qu'à ce prêtre sur le visage de
qui brillaient les lueurs d'une espérance. Le prêtre avait été sublime,
et aussi fin que sublime.
--Pardon, cher abbé, mais vous êtes venu dans un de ces moments suprêmes
où l'homme disparaît, car ne me croyez pas un ambitieux vulgaire.
--Oui, je le sais, reprit l'abbé, vous avez écrit l'AMBITIEUX PAR AMOUR!
Hé! mon enfant, c'est un désespoir d'amour qui m'a fait prêtre en 1786,
à vingt-deux ans. En 1788, j'étais curé. Je sais la vie. J'ai déjà
refusé trois évêchés, je veux mourir à Besançon.
--Venez _la_ voir? s'écria Savarus en prenant la bougie et menant l'abbé
dans le cabinet magnifique où se trouvait le portrait de la duchesse
d'Argaiolo qu'il éclaira.
--C'est une de ces femmes qui sont faites pour régner! dit le vicaire en
comprenant ce qu'Albert lui témoignait d'affection par cette muette
confidence. Mais il y a bien de la fierté sur ce front, il est
implacable, elle ne pardonnerait pas une injure! C'est un archange
Michel, l'ange des exécutions, l'ange inflexible... Tout ou rien! est la
devise de ces caractères angéliques. Il y a je ne sais quoi de
divinement sauvage dans cette tête!...
--Vous l'avez bien devinée, s'écria Savarus. Mais, mon cher abbé, voici
plus de douze ans qu'elle règne sur ma vie, et je n'ai pas une pensée à
me reprocher.....
--Ah! si vous en aviez autant fait pour Dieu?... dit naïvement l'abbé.
Parlons de vos affaires. Voici dix jours que je travaille pour vous. Si
vous êtes un vrai politique, vous suivrez mes conseils cette fois-ci.
Vous n'en seriez pas où vous en êtes, si vous étiez allé quand je vous
le disais à l'hôtel de Rupt; mais vous irez demain, je vous y présente
le soir. La terre des Rouxey est menacée, il faut plaider dans deux
jours. L'Élection ne se fera pas avant trois jours. On aura soin de ne
pas avoir fini de constituer le bureau le premier jour; nous aurons
plusieurs scrutins, et vous arriverez par un ballottage...
--Et comment?...
--En gagnant le procès des Rouxey, vous aurez quatre-vingts voix
légitimistes, ajoutez-les aux trente voix dont je dispose, nous
arrivons à cent dix. Or, comme il vous en restera vingt du
Comité-Boucher, vous en posséderez en tout cent trente.
--Hé! bien, dit Albert, il en faut soixante-quinze de plus.....
--Oui, dit le prêtre, car tout le reste est au Ministère. Mais, mon
enfant, vous avez à vous deux cents voix, et la Préfecture n'en a que
cent quatre-vingts.
--J'ai deux cents voix?... dit Albert qui demeura stupide d'étonnement
après s'être dressé sur ses pieds comme poussé par un ressort.
--Vous avez les voix de monsieur de Chavoncourt, reprit l'abbé.
--Et comment? dit Albert.
--Vous épousez mademoiselle Sidonie de Chavoncourt.
--Jamais!
--Vous épousez mademoiselle Sidonie de Chavoncourt, répéta froidement le
prêtre.
--Mais voyez? elle est implacable, dit Albert en montrant Francesca.
--Vous épousez mademoiselle Chavoncourt, répéta froidement le prêtre
pour la troisième fois.
Cette fois Albert comprit. Le vicaire-général ne voulait pas tremper
dans le plan qui souriait enfin à ce politique au désespoir. Une parole
de plus eût compromis la dignité, l'honnêteté du prêtre.
--Vous trouverez demain à l'hôtel de Rupt madame de Chavoncourt et sa
seconde fille, vous la remercierez de ce qu'elle doit faire pour vous,
vous lui direz que votre reconnaissance est sans bornes; enfin vous lui
appartenez corps et âme, votre avenir est désormais celui de sa famille,
vous êtes désintéressé, vous avez une si grande confiance en vous que
vous regardez une nomination de député comme une dot suffisante. Vous
aurez un combat avec madame de Chavoncourt, elle voudra votre parole.
Cette soirée, mon fils, est tout votre avenir. Mais, sachez-le, je ne
suis pour rien là-dedans. Moi, je ne suis coupable que des voix
légitimistes, je vous ai conquis madame de Watteville, et c'est toute
l'aristocratie de Besançon. Amédée de Soulas et Vauchelles, qui voteront
pour vous, ont entraîné la jeunesse, madame de Watteville vous aura les
vieillards. Quant à mes voix, elles sont infaillibles.
--Qui donc a tourné madame de Chavoncourt? demanda Savarus.
--Ne me questionnez pas, répondit l'abbé. Monsieur de Chavoncourt, qui a
trois filles à marier, est incapable d'augmenter sa fortune. Si
Vauchelles épouse la première sans dot, à cause de la vieille tante qui
finance au contrat, que faire des deux autres? Sidonie a seize ans, et
vous avez des trésors dans votre ambition. Quelqu'un a dit à madame de
Chavoncourt qu'il valait mieux marier sa fille que d'envoyer son mari
manger de l'argent à Paris. Ce quelqu'un mène madame de Chavoncourt, et
madame de Chavoncourt mène son mari.
--Assez, cher abbé! Je comprends. Une fois nommé député, j'ai la fortune
de quelqu'un à faire, et en la faisant splendide je serai dégagé de ma
parole. Vous avez en moi un fils, un homme qui vous devra son bonheur.
Mon Dieu! qu'ai-je fait pour mériter une si véritable amitié?
--Vous avez fait triompher le Chapitre, dit en souriant le
vicaire-général. Maintenant gardez le secret du tombeau sur tout ceci?
Nous ne sommes rien, nous ne faisons rien. Si l'on nous savait nous
mêlant d'élections, nous serions mangés tout crus par les puritains de
la Gauche qui font pis, et blâmés par quelques-uns des nôtres. Madame de
Chavoncourt ne se doute pas de ma participation dans tout ceci. Je ne me
suis fié qu'à madame de Watteville sur qui nous pouvons compter comme
sur nous-mêmes.
--Je vous amènerai la duchesse pour que vous nous bénissiez! s'écria
l'ambitieux.
Après avoir reconduit le vieux prêtre, Albert se coucha dans les langes
du pouvoir.
A neuf heures du soir, le lendemain, comme chacun peut se l'imaginer,
les salons de madame la baronne de Watteville étaient remplis par
l'aristocratie bisontine convoquée extraordinairement. On y discutait
l'_exception_ d'aller aux Élections pour faire plaisir à la fille des de
Rupt. On savait que l'ancien maître des requêtes, le secrétaire d'un des
plus fidèles ministres de la branche aînée, allait être introduit.
Madame de Chavoncourt était venue avec sa seconde fille Sidonie mise
divinement bien, tandis que l'aînée, sûre de son prétendu, n'avait
recours à aucun artifice de toilette. Ces petites choses s'observent en
province. L'abbé de Grancey montrait sa belle tête fine, de groupe en
groupe, écoutant, n'ayant l'air de se mêler de rien, mais disant de ces
mots incisifs qui résument les questions et les commandent.
--Si la branche aînée revenait, disait-il à un ancien homme d'État
septuagénaire, quels politiques trouverait-elle?--Seul sur son banc,
Berryer ne sait que devenir; s'il avait soixante voix, il entraverait
le gouvernement dans bien des occasions et renverserait des
ministères!--On va nommer le duc de Fitz-James à Toulouse.--Vous ferez
gagner à monsieur de Watteville son procès!--Si vous votez pour monsieur
de Savarus, les républicains voteront avec vous plutôt que de voter avec
les juste-milieu! Etc., etc.
A neuf heures, Albert n'était pas encore venu. Madame de Watteville
voulut voir une impertinence dans un pareil retard.
--Chère baronne, dit madame de Chavoncourt, ne faisons pas dépendre
d'une vétille de si sérieuses affaires. Quelque botte vernie qui tarde à
sécher... une consultation retiennent peut-être monsieur de Savarus.
Philomène regarda madame de Chavoncourt de travers.
--Elle est bien bonne pour monsieur de Savarus, dit Philomène tout bas à
sa mère.
--Mais, reprit la baronne en souriant, il s'agit d'un mariage entre
Sidonie et monsieur de Savarus.
Philomène alla brusquement vers une croisée qui donnait sur le jardin. A
dix heures monsieur de Savarus n'avait pas encore paru. L'orage qui
grondait éclata. Quelques nobles se mirent à jouer, trouvant la chose
intolérable. L'abbé de Grancey, qui ne savait que penser, alla vers la
fenêtre où Philomène s'était cachée et dit tout haut, tant il était
stupéfait:--Il doit être mort! Le vicaire-général sortit dans le jardin
suivi de monsieur de Watteville, de Philomène, et tous trois ils
montèrent sur le kiosque. Tout était fermé chez Albert, aucune lumière
ne s'apercevait.
--Jérôme! cria Philomène en voyant le domestique dans la cour. L'abbé de
Grancey regarda Philomène.--Où donc est votre maître? dit Philomène au
domestique venu au pied du mur.
--Parti, en poste! mademoiselle.
--Il est perdu, s'écria l'abbé de Grancey, ou heureux!
La joie du triomphe ne fut pas si bien étouffée sur la figure de
Philomène qu'elle ne fût devinée par le vicaire-général qui feignit de
ne s'apercevoir de rien.
--Qu'est-ce que Philomène a pu faire en ceci? se demandait le prêtre.
Tous trois, ils rentrèrent dans les salons où monsieur de Watteville
annonça l'étrange, la singulière, l'ébouriffante nouvelle du départ de
l'avocat Albert Savaron de Savarus en poste, sans qu'on sût les motifs
de cette disparition. A onze heures et demie, il ne restait plus que
quinze personnes, parmi lesquelles se trouvait madame de Chavoncourt et
l'abbé de Godenars, autre vicaire-général, homme d'environ quarante ans
qui voulait être évêque, les deux demoiselles de Chavoncourt et monsieur
de Vauchelles, l'abbé de Grancey, Philomène, Amédée de Soulas et un
ancien magistrat démissionnaire, l'un des plus influents personnages de
la haute société de Besançon qui tenait beaucoup à l'élection d'Albert
Savarus. L'abbé de Grancey se mit à côté de la baronne de manière à
regarder Philomène dont la figure, ordinairement pâle, offrait alors une
coloration fiévreuse.
--Que peut-il être arrivé à monsieur de Savarus? dit madame de
Chavoncourt.
En ce moment un domestique en livrée apporta sur un plat d'argent une
lettre à l'abbé de Grancey.
--Lisez, dit la baronne.
Le vicaire-général lut la lettre, et vit Philomène devenir soudain
blanche comme son fichu.
--Elle reconnaît l'écriture, se dit-il après avoir jeté sur la jeune
fille un regard par-dessus ses lunettes. Il plia la lettre et la mit
froidement dans sa poche sans dire un mot. En trois minutes il reçut de
Philomène trois regards qui lui suffirent à tout deviner.--Elle aime
Albert Savarus! pensa le vicaire-général. Il se leva, Philomène reçut
une commotion; il salua, fit quelques pas vers la porte, et, dans le
second salon, il fut rejoint par Philomène qui lui dit:--Monsieur de
Grancey, c'est de _lui_! _d'Albert!_
--Comment pouvez-vous assez connaître son écriture pour la distinguer de
si loin!
Cette fille, prise dans les lacs de son impatience et de sa colère, dit
un mot que l'abbé trouva sublime.
--Parce que je l'aime! Qu'y a-t-il! dit-elle après une pause.
--Il renonce à son élection, répondit l'abbé.
Philomène se mit un doigt sur les lèvres.
--Je demande le secret comme pour une confession, dit-elle avant de
rentrer au salon. S'il n'y a plus d'élection, il n'y aura plus de
mariage avec Sidonie!
Le lendemain matin, Philomène, en allant à la messe, apprit par Mariette
une partie des circonstances qui motivaient la disparition d'Albert au
moment le plus critique de sa vie.
--Mademoiselle, il est arrivé de Paris dans la matinée à l'Hôtel
National un vieux monsieur qui avait sa voiture, une belle voiture à
quatre chevaux, un courrier en avant et un domestique. Enfin, Jérôme,
qui a vu la voiture au départ, prétend que ce ne peut être qu'un prince
ou qu'un milord.
--Y avait-il sur la voiture une couronne fermée! dit Philomène.
--Je ne sais pas, dit Mariette. Sur le coup de deux heures, il est venu
chez monsieur Savarus en lui faisant remettre sa carte. En la voyant,
monsieur, dit Jérôme, est devenu blanc comme un linge et il a dit de
faire entrer. Comme il a fermé lui-même sa porte à clef, il est
impossible de savoir ce que ce vieux monsieur et l'avocat se sont dit;
mais ils sont restés environ une heure ensemble; après quoi le vieux
monsieur, accompagné de l'avocat, a fait monter son domestique. Jérôme a
vu sortir ce domestique avec un immense paquet long de quatre pieds qui
avait l'air d'une grosse toile à canevas. Le vieux monsieur tenait à la
main un gros paquet de papiers. L'avocat, plus pâle que s'il allait
mourir, lui qui est si fier, si digne, était dans un état à faire
pitié... Mais il agissait si respectueusement avec le vieux monsieur
qu'il n'aurait pas eu plus d'égards pour le roi. Jérôme et monsieur
Albert Savaron ont accompagné ce vieillard jusqu'à sa voiture, qui se
trouvait tout attelée de quatre chevaux. Le courrier est parti sur le
coup de trois heures. Monsieur est allé droit à la préfecture, et de là
chez monsieur Gentillet qui lui a vendu la vieille calèche de voyage de
feu madame Saint-Vier, puis il a commandé des chevaux à la poste pour
six heures. Il est rentré chez lui pour faire ses paquets; sans doute il
a écrit plusieurs billets; enfin il a mis ordre à ses affaires avec
monsieur Girardet qui est venu et qui est resté jusqu'à sept heures.
Jérôme a porté un mot chez monsieur Boucher où monsieur était attendu à
dîner. Pour lors, à sept heures et demie, l'avocat est parti, laissant
trois mois de gages à Jérôme et lui disant de chercher une place. Il a
laissé ses clefs à monsieur Girardet qu'il a reconduit chez lui, et chez
qui, dit Jérôme, il a pris une soupe, car monsieur Girardet n'avait pas
encore dîné à sept heures et demie. Quand monsieur Savaron est remonté
dans sa voiture, il était comme un mort. Jérôme, qui naturellement a
salué son maître, l'a entendu disant au postillon: Route de Genève.
--Jérôme a-t-il demandé le nom de l'étranger à l'Hôtel National?
--Comme le vieux monsieur ne faisait que passer, on ne le lui a pas
demandé. Le domestique, par ordre sans doute, avait l'air de ne pas
parler français.
--Et la lettre qu'a reçue si tard l'abbé de Grancey? dit Philomène.
--C'est sans doute monsieur Girardet qui devait la lui remettre; mais
Jérôme dit que ce pauvre monsieur Girardet, qui aime l'avocat Savaron,
était tout aussi saisi que lui. Celui qui est venu avec mystère s'en va,
dit mademoiselle Galard, avec mystère.
Philomène eut à partir de ce récit un air penseur et absorbé qui fut
visible pour tout le monde. Il est inutile de parler du bruit que fit
dans Besançon la disparition de l'avocat Savaron. On sut que le préfet
s'était prêté de la meilleure grâce du monde à lui expédier à l'instant
un passeport pour l'étranger, car il se trouvait ainsi débarrassé de son
seul adversaire. Le lendemain, monsieur de Chavoncourt fut nommé
d'emblée à une majorité de cent quarante voix.
--Jean s'en alla comme il était venu, dit un électeur en apprenant la
fuite d'Albert Savaron.
Cet événement vint à l'appui des préjugés qui existent à Besançon contre
les étrangers et qui, deux ans auparavant, s'étaient corroborés à propos
de l'affaire du journal républicain. Puis dix jours après, il n'était
plus question d'Albert de Savarus. Trois personnes seulement, l'avoué
Girardet, le vicaire-général et Philomène étaient gravement affectés par
cette disparition. Girardet savait que l'étranger aux cheveux blancs
était le prince Soderini, car il avait vu la carte, il le dit au
vicaire-général; mais Philomène, beaucoup plus instruite qu'eux,
connaissait depuis environ trois mois la nouvelle de la mort du duc
d'Argaiolo.
Au mois d'avril 1836, personne n'avait eu de nouvelles ni entendu parler
de monsieur Albert de Savarus. Jérôme et Mariette allaient se marier;
mais la baronne avait dit confidentiellement à sa femme de chambre
d'attendre le mariage de Philomène, et que les deux noces se feraient
ensemble.
--Il est temps de marier Philomène, dit un jour la baronne à monsieur de
Watteville, elle a dix-neuf ans, et depuis quelques mois elle change à
faire peur...
--Je ne sais pas ce qu'elle a, dit le baron.
--Quand les pères ne savent pas ce qu'ont leurs filles, les mères le
devinent, dit la baronne, il faut la marier.
--Je le veux bien, dit le baron, et pour mon compte je lui donne les
Rouxey, maintenant que le tribunal nous a mis d'accord avec la commune
des Riceys en fixant mes limites à trois cents mètres à partir de la
base de la Dent de Vilard. On y creuse un fossé pour recevoir toutes les
eaux et les diriger dans le lac. La Commune n'a pas appelé, le jugement
est définitif.
--Vous n'avez pas encore deviné, dit la baronne, que ce jugement me
coûte trente mille francs donnés à Chantonnit. Ce paysan ne voulait pas
autre chose, il a l'air d'avoir gain de cause pour sa commune, et il
nous a vendu la paix. Si vous donnez les Rouxey, vous n'aurez plus rien,
dit la baronne.
--Je n'ai pas besoin de grand'chose, dit le baron, je m'en vais...
--Vous mangez comme un ogre.
--Précisément: j'ai beau manger, je me sens les jambes de plus en plus
faibles....
--C'est de tourner, dit la baronne.
--Je ne sais pas, dit le baron.
--Nous marierons Philomène à monsieur de Soulas; si vous lui donnez les
Rouxey, réservez-vous-en la jouissance; moi je leur donnerai
vingt-quatre mille francs de rente sur le grand-livre. Nos enfants
demeureront ici, je ne les vois pas bien malheureux...
--Non, je leur donne les Rouxey tout à fait. Philomène aime les Rouxey.
--Vous êtes singulier avec votre fille! vous ne me demandez pas à moi si
j'aime les Rouxey?
Philomène, appelée incontinent, apprit qu'elle épouserait monsieur
Amédée de Soulas dans les premiers jours du mois de mai.
--Je vous remercie, ma mère, et vous mon père, d'avoir pensé à mon
établissement, mais je ne veux pas me marier, je suis très-heureuse
d'être avec vous...
--Des phrases! dit la baronne. Vous n'aimez pas monsieur le comte de
Soulas, voilà tout.
--Si vous voulez savoir la vérité, je n'épouserai jamais monsieur de
Soulas...
--Oh! le jamais d'une fille de dix-neuf ans! reprit la baronne en
souriant avec amertume.
--Le jamais de mademoiselle de Watteville, reprit Philomène avec un
accent prononcé. Mon père n'a pas, je pense, l'intention de me marier
sans mon consentement?
--Oh! ma foi, non, dit le pauvre baron en regardant sa fille avec
tendresse.
--Eh! bien, répliqua sèchement la baronne en contenant une fureur de
dévote surprise de se voir bravée à l'improviste, chargez-vous, monsieur
de Watteville, d'établir vous-même votre fille! Songez-y bien,
Philomène: si vous ne vous mariez pas à mon gré, vous n'aurez rien de
moi pour votre établissement.
La querelle ainsi commencée entre madame de Watteville et le baron qui
appuyait sa fille, alla si loin que Philomène et son père furent obligés
de passer la belle saison aux Rouxey; l'habitation de l'hôtel de Rupt
leur était devenue insupportable. On apprit alors dans Besançon que
mademoiselle de Watteville avait positivement refusé monsieur le comte
de Soulas. Après leur mariage, Jérôme et Mariette étaient venus aux
Rouxey pour succéder un jour à Modinier. Le baron répara, restaura la
Chartreuse au goût de sa fille. En apprenant que cette réparation
coûtait environ soixante mille francs, que Philomène et son père
faisaient construire une serre, la baronne reconnut quelque levain de
malice dans sa fille. Le baron acheta plusieurs enclaves et un petit
domaine d'une valeur de trente mille francs. On dit à madame de
Watteville que loin d'elle Philomène se montrait une maîtresse-fille,
elle étudiait les moyens de faire valoir les Rouxey, s'était donné une
amazone et montait à cheval; son père, qu'elle rendait heureux, qui ne
se plaignait plus de sa santé, qui devenait gras, l'accompagnait dans
ses excursions. Aux approches de la fête de la baronne, qui se nommait
Louise, le vicaire-général vint alors aux Rouxey, sans doute envoyé par
madame de Watteville et par monsieur de Soulas pour négocier la paix
entre la mère et la fille.
--Cette petite Philomène a de la tête, disait-on dans Besançon.
Après avoir noblement payé les quatre-vingt-dix mille francs dépensés
aux Rouxey, la baronne faisait passer à son mari mille francs par mois
environ pour y vivre: elle ne voulait pas se donner des torts. Le père
et la fille ne demandèrent pas mieux que de retourner, le quinze août, à
Besançon, pour y rester jusqu'à la fin du mois. Quand le
vicaire-général, après le dîner, prit Philomène à part pour entamer la
question du mariage en lui faisant comprendre qu'il ne fallait plus
compter sur Albert de qui, depuis un an, on n'avait aucune nouvelle, il
fut arrêté net par un geste de Philomène. Cette bizarre fille saisit
monsieur de Grancey par le bras et l'amena sur un banc, sous un massif
de rhododendron, d'où se découvrait le lac.
--Écoutez, cher abbé, vous que j'aime autant que mon père, car vous avez
de l'affection pour mon Albert, il faut enfin vous l'avouer, j'ai commis
des crimes pour être sa femme, et il doit être mon mari... Tenez, lisez!
Elle lui tendit un numéro de gazette qu'elle avait dans la poche de son
tablier, en lui indiquant l'article suivant sous la rubrique de
Florence, au 25 mai.
  «Le mariage de monsieur le duc de Rhétoré, fils aîné de monsieur le
  duc de Chaulieu, ancien ambassadeur, avec madame la duchesse
  d'Argaiolo, née princesse Soderini, s'est célébré avec beaucoup
  d'éclat. Des fêtes nombreuses, données à l'occasion de ce mariage,
  animent en ce moment la ville de Florence. La fortune de madame la
  duchesse d'Argaiolo est une des plus considérables de l'Italie, car le
  feu duc l'avait instituée sa légataire universelle.»
--Celle qu'il aimait est mariée, dit-elle, je les ai séparés!
--Vous, et comment? dit l'abbé.
Philomène allait répondre, lorsqu'un grand cri jeté par deux jardiniers,
et précédé du bruit d'un corps tombant à l'eau, l'interrompit, elle se
leva, courut en criant:--Oh! mon père... Elle ne voyait plus le baron.
En voulant prendre un fragment de granit où il crut apercevoir
l'empreinte d'un coquillage, fait qui eût souffleté quelque système de
géologie, monsieur de Watteville s'était avancé sur le talus, avait
perdu l'équilibre et roulé dans le lac dont la plus grande profondeur se
trouve naturellement au pied de la chaussée. Les jardiniers eurent une
peine infinie à faire prendre au baron une perche en fouillant à
l'endroit où bouillonnait l'eau; mais enfin ils le ramenèrent couvert de
vase où il était entré très-avant et où il enfonçait davantage en se
débattant. Monsieur de Watteville avait beaucoup dîné, sa digestion
était commencée, elle fut interrompue. Quand il eut été déshabillé,
nettoyé, mis au lit, il fut dans un état si visiblement dangereux, que
deux domestiques montèrent à cheval, l'un pour Besançon, l'autre pour
aller chercher au plus près un médecin et un chirurgien.
Quand madame de Watteville arriva huit heures après l'événement avec les
premiers chirurgien et médecin de Besançon, ils trouvèrent monsieur de
Watteville dans un état désespéré, malgré les soins intelligents du
médecin des Riceys. La peur déterminait une infiltration séreuse au
cerveau, la digestion arrêtée achevait de tuer le pauvre baron.
Cette mort, qui n'aurait pas eu lieu si, disait madame de Watteville,
son mari était resté à Besançon, fut attribuée par elle à la résistance
de sa fille qu'elle prit en aversion en se livrant à une douleur et à
des regrets évidemment exagérés. Elle appela le baron _son cher agneau_!
Le dernier Watteville fut enterré dans un îlot du lac des Rouxey, où la
baronne fit élever un petit monument gothique en marbre blanc, pareil à
celui dit d'Héloïse au Père-Lachaise.
Un mois après cet événement, la baronne et sa fille vivaient à l'hôtel
de Rupt dans un sauvage silence. Philomène était en proie à une douleur
sérieuse, qui ne s'épanchait point au dehors: elle s'accusait de la mort
de son père et soupçonnait un autre malheur, encore plus grand à ses
yeux, et bien certainement son ouvrage; car, ni l'avoué Girardet, ni
l'abbé de Grancey n'obtenaient de lumières sur le sort d'Albert. Ce
silence était effrayant. Dans un paroxisme de repentir, elle éprouva le
besoin de révéler au vicaire-général les affreuses combinaisons par
lesquelles elle avait séparé Francesca d'Albert. Ce fut quelque chose de
simple et de formidable. Mademoiselle de Watteville avait supprimé les
lettres d'Albert à la duchesse, et celle par laquelle Francesca
annonçait à son amant la maladie de son mari en le prévenant qu'elle ne
pourrait plus lui répondre pendant le temps qu'elle se consacrerait,
comme elle le devait, au moribond. Ainsi pendant les préoccupations
d'Albert relativement aux élections, la duchesse ne lui avait écrit que
deux lettres, celle où elle lui apprenait le danger du duc d'Argaiolo,
celle où elle lui disait qu'elle était veuve, deux nobles et sublimes
lettres que Philomène garda. Après avoir travaillé pendant plusieurs
nuits, Philomène était parvenue à imiter parfaitement l'écriture
d'Albert. Aux véritables lettres de cet amant fidèle, elle avait
substitué trois lettres dont les brouillons communiqués au vieux prêtre
le firent frémir, tant le génie du mal y apparaissait dans toute sa
perfection. Philomène, tenant la plume pour Albert, y préparait la
duchesse au changement du Français faussement infidèle. Philomène avait
répondu à la nouvelle de la mort du duc d'Argaiolo par la nouvelle du
prochain mariage d'Albert avec elle-même, Philomène. Les deux lettres
avaient dû se croiser et s'étaient croisées. L'esprit infernal avec
lequel les lettres furent écrites, surprit tellement le vicaire-général
qu'il les relut. A la dernière, Francesca, blessée au coeur par une
fille qui voulait tuer l'amour chez sa rivale, avait répondu par ces
simples mots: «_Vous êtes libre, adieu._»
--Les crimes purement moraux et qui ne laissent aucune prise à la
justice humaine, sont les plus infâmes, les plus odieux, dit sévèrement
l'abbé de Grancey. Dieu les punit souvent ici-bas: là gît la raison des
épouvantables malheurs qui nous paraissent inexplicables. De tous les
crimes secrets ensevelis dans les mystères de la vie privée, un des plus
déshonorants est celui de briser le cachet d'une lettre ou de la lire
subrepticement. Toute personne, quelle qu'elle soit, poussée par quelque
raison que ce soit, qui se permet cet acte, a fait une tache ineffaçable
à sa probité. Sentez-vous tout ce qu'il y a de touchant, de divin dans
l'histoire de ce jeune page, faussement accusé, qui porte une lettre où
se trouve l'ordre de le tuer, qui se met en route sans une mauvaise
pensée, que la Providence prend alors sous sa protection et qu'elle
sauve, miraculeusement, disons-nous!... Savez-vous en quoi consiste le
miracle? les vertus ont une auréole aussi puissante que celle de
l'Enfance innocente. Je vous dis ces choses sans vouloir vous
admonester, dit le vieux prêtre à Philomène avec une profonde tristesse.
Hélas! je ne suis pas ici le grand-pénitencier, vous n'êtes pas
agenouillée aux pieds de Dieu, je suis un ami terrifié par
l'appréhension de vos châtiments. Qu'est-il devenu, ce pauvre Albert? ne
s'est-il pas donné la mort? Il cachait une violence inouïe sous son
calme affecté. Je comprends que le vieux prince Soderini, père de madame
la duchesse d'Argaiolo, est venu redemander les lettres et les portraits
de sa fille. Voilà le coup de foudre tombé sur la tête d'Albert qui aura
sans doute essayé d'aller se justifier... Mais comment, en quatorze
mois, n'a-t-il pas donné de ses nouvelles?
--Oh! si je l'épouse, il sera si heureux...
--Heureux?... il ne vous aime pas. Vous n'aurez d'ailleurs pas une si
grande fortune à lui apporter. Votre mère a la plus profonde aversion
pour vous, vous lui avez fait une sauvage réponse qui l'a blessée et qui
vous ruinera.
--Quoi! dit Philomène.
--Quand elle vous a dit hier que l'obéissance était le seul moyen de
réparer vos fautes, et qu'elle vous a rappelé la nécessité de vous
marier en vous parlant d'Amédée.--Si vous l'aimez tant, épousez-le, ma
mère! Lui avez-vous, oui ou non, jeté cette phrase à la tête?
--Oui, dit Philomène.
--Eh! bien, je la connais, reprit monsieur de Grancey, dans quelques
mois elle sera comtesse de Soulas! Elle aura, certes, des enfants, elle
donnera quarante mille francs de rentes à monsieur de Soulas; en outre,
elle lui fera des avantages, et réduira votre part dans ses biens-fonds
autant qu'elle pourra. Vous serez pauvre pendant toute sa vie, et elle
n'a que trente-huit ans! Vous aurez pour tout bien la terre des Rouxey
et le peu de droits que vous laissera la liquidation de la succession de
votre père, si toutefois votre mère consent à se départir de ses droits
sur les Rouxey! Sous le rapport des intérêts matériels, vous avez déjà
bien mal arrangé votre vie; sous le rapport des sentiments, je la crois
bouleversée... Au lieu d'être venue à votre mère...
Philomène fit un sauvage mouvement de tête.
--A votre mère, reprit le vicaire-général, et à la Religion qui vous
auraient, au premier mouvement de votre coeur, éclairée, conseillée,
guidée; vous avez voulu vous conduire seule, ignorant la vie et
n'écoutant que la passion!
Ces paroles si sages épouvantèrent Philomène.
--Et que dois-je faire? dit-elle après une pause.
--Pour réparer vos fautes, il faudrait en connaître l'étendue, demanda
l'abbé.
--Eh! bien, je vais écrire au seul homme qui puisse avoir des
renseignements sur le sort d'Albert, à monsieur Léopold Hannequin,
notaire à Paris, son ami d'enfance.
--N'écrivez plus que pour rendre hommage à la vérité, répondit le
vicaire-général. Confiez-moi les véritables lettres et les fausses,
faites-moi vos aveux bien en détail, comme au directeur de votre
conscience, en me demandant les moyens d'expier vos fautes et vous en
rapportant à moi. Je verrai... Car, avant tout, rendez à ce malheureux
son innocence devant l'être dont il a fait son dieu sur cette terre.
Même après avoir perdu le bonheur, Albert doit tenir à sa justification.
Philomène promit à l'abbé de Grancey de lui obéir en espérant que ses
démarches auraient peut-être pour résultat de lui ramener Albert.
Peu de temps après la confidence de Philomène, un clerc de monsieur
Léopold Hannequin vint à Besançon muni d'une procuration générale
d'Albert, et se présenta tout d'abord chez monsieur Girardet pour le
prier de vendre la maison appartenant à monsieur Savaron. L'avoué se
chargea de cette affaire par amitié pour l'avocat. Ce clerc vendit le
mobilier, et avec le produit put payer ce que devait Albert à Girardet
qui lors de l'inexplicable départ lui avait remis cinq mille francs, en
se chargeant d'ailleurs de ses recouvrements. Quand Girardet demanda ce
qu'était devenu ce noble et beau lutteur auquel il s'était intéressé, le
clerc répondit que son patron seul le savait, et que le notaire avait
paru très-affligé des choses contenues dans la dernière lettre écrite
par monsieur Albert de Savarus.
En apprenant cette nouvelle, le vicaire-général écrivit à Léopold. Voici
la réponse du digne notaire.
  «A MONSIEUR L'ABBÉ DE GRANCEY,
  «_vicaire-général du diocèse de Besançon_.
  Paris.
  «Hélas! monsieur, il n'est au pouvoir de personne de rendre Albert à la
  vie du monde: il y a renoncé. Il est novice à la Grande-Chartreuse, près
  Grenoble. Vous savez encore mieux que moi, qui viens de l'apprendre, que
  tout meurt sur le seuil de ce cloître. En prévoyant ma visite, Albert a
  mis le Général des Chartreux entre tous mes efforts et lui. Je connais
  assez ce noble coeur pour savoir qu'il est victime d'une trame odieuse
  et pour nous invisible; mais tout est consommé. Madame la duchesse
  d'Argaiolo, maintenant duchesse de Rhétoré, me semble avoir poussé la
  cruauté bien loin. A Belgirate, où elle n'était plus quand Albert y
  courut, elle avait laissé des ordres pour lui faire croire qu'elle
  habitait Londres. De Londres, Albert alla chercher sa maîtresse à Naples
  et de Naples à Rome, où elle s'engageait avec le duc de Rhétoré. Quand
  Albert put rencontrer madame d'Argaiolo, ce fut à Florence, au moment où
  elle célébrait son mariage. Notre pauvre ami s'est évanoui dans
  l'église, et n'a jamais pu, même en se trouvant en danger de mort,
  obtenir une explication de cette femme, qui devait avoir je ne sais quoi
  dans le coeur. Albert a voyagé pendant sept mois à la recherche d'une
  sauvage créature qui se faisait un jeu de lui échapper: il ne savait où
  ni comment la saisir. J'ai vu notre pauvre ami à son passage à Paris; et
  si vous l'aviez vu comme moi, vous vous seriez aperçu qu'il ne lui
  fallait pas dire un mot au sujet de la duchesse, à moins de vouloir
  provoquer une crise où sa raison eût couru des risques. S'il avait connu
  son crime, il aurait pu trouver des moyens de justification; mais,
  faussement accusé de s'être marié! que faire! Albert est mort, et bien
  mort pour le monde. Il a voulu le repos, espérons que le profond silence
  et la prière dans lesquels il s'est jeté, feront son bonheur sous une
  autre forme. Si vous l'avez connu, monsieur, vous devez bien le plaindre
  et plaindre aussi ses amis! Agréez, etc.»
Aussitôt cette lettre reçue, le bon vicaire-général écrivit au Général
des Chartreux, et voici quelle fut la réponse d'Albert Savarus.
  LE FRÈRE ALBERT A MONSIEUR L'ABBÉ DE GRANCEY,
  _vicaire-général du diocèse de Besançon_.
  De la Grande-Chartreuse.
  «J'ai reconnu, cher et bien-aimé vicaire-général, votre âme tendre et
  votre coeur encore jeune dans tout ce que vient de me communiquer le
  Révérend Père Général de notre Ordre. Vous avez deviné le seul voeu qui
  restât dans le dernier repli de mon coeur relativement aux choses du
  monde: faire rendre justice à mes sentiments par celle qui m'a si
  maltraité! Mais, en me laissant la liberté d'user de votre offre, le
  Général a voulu savoir si ma vocation était sûre: il a eu l'insigne
  bonté de me dire sa pensée en me voyant décidé à demeurer dans un absolu
  silence à cet égard. Si j'avais cédé à la tentation de réhabiliter
  l'homme du monde, le religieux était rejeté de ce Monastère. La grâce a
  certainement agi: car pour avoir été court, le combat n'en a pas été
  moins vif ni moins cruel. N'est-ce pas vous dire assez que je ne saurais
  rentrer dans le monde? Aussi le pardon que vous me demandez pour
  l'auteur de tant de maux est-il bien entier et sans une pensée de dépit:
  je prierai Dieu qu'il veuille lui pardonner comme je lui pardonne, de
  même que je le prierai d'accorder une vie heureuse à madame de Rhétoré.
  Eh! que ce soit la Mort ou la main opiniâtre d'une jeune fille acharnée
  à se faire aimer, que ce soit un de ces coups attribués au hasard, ne
  faut-il pas toujours obéir à Dieu? Le malheur fait dans certaines âmes
  un vaste désert où retentit la voix de Dieu. J'ai trop tard connu les
  rapports entre cette vie et celle qui nous attend, car tout est usé chez
  moi. Je n'aurais pu servir dans les rangs de l'Église militante, je me
  jette pour le reste d'une vie presque éteinte au pied du sanctuaire.
  Voici la dernière fois que j'écris. Il a fallu que ce fût vous, qui
  m'aimiez et que j'aimais tant, pour me faire rompre la loi d'oubli que
  je me suis imposée en entrant dans la métropole de Saint-Bruno. Vous
  serez aussi particulièrement dans les prières de
  «_Frère_ ALBERT.»
  Novembre 1836.
--Peut-être tout est-il pour le mieux, se dit l'abbé de Grancey.
Quand il eut communiqué cette lettre à Philomène, qui baisa par un
mouvement pieux le passage qui contenait sa grâce, il lui dit:--Eh!
bien, maintenant qu'il est perdu pour vous, ne voulez-vous pas vous
réconcilier avec votre mère en épousant le comte de Soulas?
--Il faudrait qu'Albert me l'ordonnât, dit-elle.
--Vous voyez qu'il est impossible de le consulter. Le Général ne le
permettrait pas.
--Si j'allais le voir?
--On ne voit point les Chartreux. Et d'ailleurs aucune femme, excepté la
reine de France, ne peut entrer à la Chartreuse, dit l'abbé. Ainsi rien
ne vous dispense plus d'épouser le jeune monsieur de Soulas.
--Je ne veux pas faire le malheur de ma mère, répondit Philomène.
--Satan! s'écria le vicaire-général.
Vers la fin de cet hiver, l'excellent abbé de Grancey mourut. Il n'y eut
plus entre madame de Watteville et sa fille cet ami qui s'interposait
entre ces deux caractères de fer. L'événement prévu par le
vicaire-général eut lieu. Au mois d'août 1837, madame de Watteville
épousa monsieur de Soulas à Paris, où elle alla par le conseil de
Philomène, qui se montra charmante et bonne pour sa mère. Du moins,
madame de Watteville crut à l'amitié de sa fille; mais Philomène voulait
tout bonnement voir Paris pour se donner le plaisir d'une atroce
vengeance: elle ne pensait qu'à venger Savarus en martyrisant sa rivale.
On avait émancipé mademoiselle de Watteville, qui d'ailleurs atteignait
bientôt à l'âge de vingt-un ans. Sa mère, pour terminer ses comptes avec
elle, lui avait abandonné ses droits sur les Rouxey, et la fille avait
donné décharge à sa mère à raison de la succession du baron de
Watteville. Philomène avait encouragé sa mère à épouser le comte de
Soulas et à l'avantager.
--Ayons chacune notre liberté, lui dit-elle.
Madame de Soulas, inquiète des intentions de sa fille, fut surprise de
cette noblesse de procédés, elle fit présent à Philomène de six mille
francs de rente sur le grand-livre par acquit de conscience. Comme
madame la comtesse de Soulas avait quarante-huit mille francs de revenus
en terres, et qu'elle était incapable de les aliéner dans le but de
diminuer la part de Philomène, mademoiselle de Watteville était encore
un parti de dix-huit cent mille francs: les Rouxey pouvaient produire,
avec quelques améliorations, vingt mille francs de rente, outre les
avantages de l'habitation, ses redevances et ses réserves. Aussi
Philomène et sa mère, qui prirent bientôt le ton et les modes de Paris,
furent-elles facilement introduites dans le grand monde. La clef d'or,
ces mots: dix-huit cent mille francs!... brodés sur le corsage de
Philomène, servirent beaucoup plus la comtesse de Soulas que ses
prétentions à la de Rupt, ses fiertés mal placées, et même que ses
parentés tirées d'un peu loin.
Vers le mois de février 1838, Philomène, à qui bien des jeunes gens
faisaient une cour assidue, réalisa le projet qui l'amenait à Paris.
Elle voulait rencontrer la duchesse de Rhétoré, voir cette merveilleuse
femme et la plonger dans d'éternels remords. Aussi Philomène était-elle
d'une recherche et d'une coquetterie étourdissantes afin de se trouver
avec la duchesse sur un pied d'égalité. La première rencontre eut lieu
dans le bal annuellement donné pour les pensionnaires de l'ancienne
Liste civile, depuis 1830.
Un jeune homme, poussé par Philomène, dit à la duchesse en la lui
montrant:--Voilà l'une des jeunes personnes les plus remarquables, une
forte tête! Elle a fait jeter dans un cloître, à la Grande Chartreuse,
un homme d'une grande portée, Albert de Savarus dont l'existence a été
brisée par elle. C'est mademoiselle de Watteville, la fameuse héritière
de Besançon....
La duchesse pâlit, Philomène échangea vivement avec elle un de ces
regards qui, de femme à femme, sont plus mortels que les coups de
pistolet d'un duel. Francesca Soderini, qui soupçonna l'innocence
d'Albert, sortit aussitôt du bal, en quittant brusquement son
interlocuteur incapable de deviner la terrible blessure qu'il venait de
faire à la belle duchesse de Rhétoré.
  «Si vous voulez en savoir davantage sur Albert, venez au bal de
  l'Opéra mardi prochain, en tenant à la main un souci.»
Ce billet anonyme, envoyé par Philomène à la duchesse, amena la
malheureuse Italienne au bal où Philomène lui remit en main toutes les
lettres d'Albert, celle écrite par le vicaire-général à Léopold
Hannequin ainsi que la réponse du notaire, et même celle où elle avait
fait ses aveux à monsieur de Grancey.
--Je ne veux pas être seule à souffrir, car nous avons été tout aussi
cruelles l'une que l'autre! dit-elle à sa rivale.
Après avoir savouré la stupéfaction qui se peignit sur le beau visage de
la duchesse, Philomène se sauva, ne reparut plus dans le monde, et
revint avec sa mère à Besançon.
Mademoiselle de Watteville, qui vécut seule dans sa terre des Rouxey,
montant à cheval, chassant, refusant ses deux ou trois partis par an,
venant quatre ou cinq fois par hiver à Besançon, occupée à faire valoir
sa terre, passa pour une personne extrêmement originale. Elle est une
des célébrités de l'Est.
Madame de Soulas a deux enfants, un garçon et une fille, elle a rajeuni;
mais le jeune monsieur de Soulas a considérablement vieilli.
--Ma fortune me coûte cher, disait-il au jeune Chavoncourt. Pour bien
connaître une dévote, il faut malheureusement l'épouser!
Mademoiselle de Watteville se conduit en fille vraiment extraordinaire.
On disait d'elle:--_Elle a des lubies!_ Elle va tous les ans voir les
murailles de la Grande-Chartreuse. Peut-être voulait-elle imiter son
grand-oncle en franchissant l'enceinte de ce couvent pour y chercher son
mari, comme Watteville franchit les murs de son monastère pour recouvrer
la liberté.
En 1841, elle quitta Besançon dans l'intention, disait-on, de se marier;
mais, on ne sait pas encore la véritable cause de ce voyage d'où elle
est revenue dans un état qui lui interdit de jamais reparaître dans le
monde. Par un de ces hasards auxquels le vieil abbé de Grancey avait
fait allusion, elle se trouva sur la Loire dans le bateau à vapeur dont
la chaudière fit explosion. Mademoiselle de Watteville fut si
cruellement maltraitée qu'elle a perdu le bras et la jambe gauche; son
visage porte d'affreuses cicatrices qui la privent de sa beauté; sa
santé soumise à des troubles horribles lui laisse peu de jours sans
souffrance. Enfin, elle ne sort plus aujourd'hui de la Chartreuse des
Rouxey où elle mène une vie entièrement vouée à des pratiques
religieuses.
  Paris, mai 1842.
FIN DU PREMIER VOLUME.
Nous n'ignorons pas que le culte de sainte Philomène n'a commencé
qu'après la Révolution de 1830 en Italie. Cet anachronisme, à propos du
nom de mademoiselle de Watteville, nous a paru sans importance; mais il
a été si remarqué par des personnes qui voudraient une entière
exactitude dans cette histoire de moeurs, que l'auteur changera ce
détail aussitôt que faire se pourra.

de la vie privée tome I, by Honoré de Balzac
KORTE LEVENSBESCHRIJVING VAN CHARLES DE COSTER
Bewerkt naar Ch. Potvin, Francis Nautet enz.
Charles-Theodore-Henri De Coster werd geboren te München, den 20n
Augustus 1827. Zijn vader was intendant van graaf Charles Mercy
d'Argenteau, aartsbisschop van Tyrus, die peter des kunstenaars was en
hem de markiezin Henriette de la Tour Dupin, vrouw van den Franschen
gezant te Turijn, tot meter gaf.
De kleine De Coster, een engeltje van een knaap, sleet dus zijne
eerste levensjaren in het paleis van den aartsbisschop, midden in
weelde, in bloemen, geliefkoosd door zijne ouders en zijnen peter. Zijn
eerste opvoeding was dus zeer aristocratisch en die indrukken blijven
gewoonlijk onuitwischbaar.
Doch weinig tijds nadien verandert dit alles. Zijne ouders verlaten
München en gaan naar Brussel, waar hun tweede kind ter wereld komt;
dan sterft zijn vader te Ieperen, bij zijn broeder, die daar geneesheer
was. Zijn moeder keert terug naar Brussel bij hare zuster en hare
kinderen.
Charles was reeds in eene kostschool te Etterbeek, waar "ik mij zal
moeten schikken naar den wil van een ander", zegt hij, "na zoolang
mijn zin te hebben gedaan". Als hij uit de kostschool komt, is het
om in het "Collège Saint-Michel" te treden, waar men een oogenblik
hoopte dat het kind, dat reeds de droomerijen boven de droge studiën
verkoos, zich aan het priesterschap zou wijden.
Eerst dacht hij in de balie te treden, doch een vriend deed hem
opmerken dat de rechten en de kunst moeilijk samengaan, en De Coster,
geholpen door machtige beschermers, aanvaardde eene bediening in de
"Société Générale".
In 't lot gevallen, stelde zijne moeder eenen plaatsvervanger, die
wegliep; na eenige dagen in het regiment, bij zijn kolonel, vertoefd
te hebben, "om den plaatsvervanger te vervangen", maakte de jonge
bediende op zijne beurt van de gelegenheid gebruik om zijne plaats
te ontloopen. "Het ambtenaarsleven bevalt mij in het geheel niet",
zegde hij. In de Bank voelde hij zich als een vreemdeling te midden
van de bureaucraten. Hij stikte in die atmosfeer en "overigens wilde
hij voor zich zelven werken". De letterkundige roeping verkreeg de
bovenhand en hij trad in 1850 in de Hoogeschool van Brussel, waar
hij het diploma van candidaat in de letteren behaalde.
Maar De Coster gaf aan de Hoogeschool noch zijn hart, noch zijnen
geest, noch zijne pen. Toen hij ze verliet, was hij noch doctor,
noch professor, noch dagbladschrijver, noch tooneeldichter. Maar hij
was kunstenaar, meer dan ooit.
Vervolgens wilde hij in de redactie van een dagblad treden, maar hij
aanbad het schoone boven alles en weigerde "een werktuig te maken
van zijne pen".
Dan begint een jammerlijk leven van voortdurenden tegenspoed en
onbegrepen arbeid. In 1856 weigert hij eene plaats bij een makelaar
in wijnen,--alles wat men hem aanbood.
Om het even, de jonge kunstenaar heeft wilskracht en, door al zijn
kommer heen, maakt hij eervol naam in de Fransche letterkunde. Buiten
en behalve menigvuldige gewaardeerde bijdragen in dagbladen en
tijdschriften, levert hij, in 1856, les Frères de la bonne trogne
(Brabantsche legende); in 1857, de Légendes flamandes et wallones,
die een ongemeenen bijval ontmoeten en door de Fransche pers vleiend
beoordeeld worden; in 1861, de Contes brabançons.
Zijn peter, de aartsbisschop, had hem sedert lang zijne bescherming
onttrokken, die hem zeker ware bijgebleven, hadde De Coster zijne
studiën in de Hoogeschool van Leuven willen doen. Hij had Brussel
verkozen, waar hij vrienden vond. Dat was eene keuze doen voor de
algeheele vrijheid des geestes. In 1863 wordt het petekind van den
aartsbisschop van Tyrus lid van de Vrije Gedachte van Brussel. Hij was
toen in den vollen bloei van zijn eersten bijval en gansch vervoerd
door zijne liefde voor het schoone.
Zijne liefde voor het volk, voor het wakkere Vlaamsche volk, stuwt
hem voorwaarts en houdt zijn machtig genie bezig. De schilder Dillens
zijn vriend, bezat in zijn werkhuis een verzameling oude Vlaamsche
boeken. De Coster en Dillens doen verscheidene reizen door Zeeland
en Vlaanderen: de "Legende van Uilenspiegel" was van dan af geboren
in De Coster's brein.
De Legende van Uilenspiegel en Lamme Goedzak, in de letterwereld
met ongeduld verwacht, verscheen in 1867 in een prachtige uitgave,
opgeluisterd met twee en dertig etsen van negentien talentvolle
kunstenaars.
Ziehier wat onder meer drie Fransche bladen zeiden van dat gewrocht:
La Liberté van 18 December 1868: "'t Is een heldendicht in proza,
waarin het bloed zoo rijkelijk vloeit als het bier. Men zou zeggen
een kermis rondom eenen brandstapel".
Le Constitutionnel, 9 December 1868, wijdde drie groote kolommen
aan Uilenspiegel, waarin de recensent het boek met Goethe's Faust
vergelijkt.
Le Corsaire: "'t Is een heldendicht in proza, 't is de verheerlijking
van den Vlaamschen geest".
Heel de Fransche pers deelde dit gevoelen en drukte hare bewondering
in de vleiendste artikelen uit.
Onze Busken Huët getuigde: "Hollanders noch Vlamingen bezitten een
werk over de XVIe eeuw in Vlaanderen, dat met het meesterwerk van De
Coster kan vergeleken worden".
Na Uilenspiegel verscheen nog: Voyage de noce (1872) en le Mariage
de Toulet (1879).
Edoch De Coster, die in het volle succes van de Légendes flamandes
zijne vriendin verloren had, zag zich op 29 Juli 1869, wanneer
Uilenspiegel zoo gunstig onthaald werd, nu nog zijne moeder ontrukken.
Die ramp schokte hem diep in zijn reeds droevig bestaan, want De Coster
leefde veelal in armoede, niettegenstaande zijn talent en de gunst
waarmede zijne werken ontvangen werden. Schrale schrijversrechten,
karige toelagen, luttel betaalde lessen moesten hem vrijwaren voor
ellende. Hij kloeg dan ook, steeds denzelfden strijd te moeten
herbeginnen. In 1870 schreef hij: "Hoewel ik veel gewerkt heb
uit lust en uit liefde, begrijp ik, sedert minder dan drie jaar,
de schrikverwekkende waarde van het geld en de noodwendigheid van
een arbeid, die, genoegzaam betaald, den mensch, met den welstand,
ook vrijheid en vreugde schenkt".
Maar daarom legde hij zijne fierheid niet af.
Toen eindelijk de regeering, een tiental jaren vóór zijnen dood, er
aan dacht de verstandelijke hulpmiddelen van den grooten schrijver
ten behoeve van het onderwijs aan te wenden, was het te laat. Hij
stak zoo diep in schulden, dat zijne benoeming geen anderen uitslag
opleverde dan eene opschudding te verwekken onder zijne schuldeischers,
die zijn traktement aansloegen en hunne prooi niet meer loslieten.
Toen hij stierf, op 7 Mei 1879, verkeerde hij in de diepste ellende.
                   *       *       *       *       *
Den 22n Juli 1894 werd door het gemeentebestuur van Eisene een
eenvoudig doch treffend gedenkteeken van den beeldhouwer Samuel ter
nagedachtenis van De Coster ingehuldigd.
DE LAATSTE OOGENBLIKKEN VAN CHARLES DE COSTER.
Charles De Coster stierf op 7 Mei 1879, te Elsene, in het huis, dat
den hoek uitmaakt van de Gewijde-Boomstraat, en toen gehuurd werd
door een fruitverkooper. Heel de woning van den grooten kunstenaar
bestond uit de twee kamers op de eerste verdieping: de grootste was
zijn werkkabinet, de andere zijne slaapkamer; daarin stonden een
ijzeren bed, een kleine tafel, een houten kast, eenige stoelen.
Hij had zich den dag te voren te bed gelegd: de pisvloed waaraan
hij leed, en diens noodlottige gezellin, de longtering, waren
plotseling verergerd. Charles De Coster nam zelden zijne toevlucht tot
geneesheeren; een zijner vrienden nochtans, M. Kirkpatrick, verschrikt
over den voortgang van de kwaal, had den heer dokter Vaucleroy,
geneesheer aan de Krijgsschool, ontboden. Toen deze kwam, vond hij
aan de sponde van den zieke eene oppasster, die De Coster in zijn
verheven en grenzenloos medelijden met de onterfden en ongelukkigen,
bij zich genomen had. Deze arme vrouw, die bij den zieltogende waakte,
was zelve het toonbeeld des doods; heel haar aangezicht was ingevreten
door zweren. De geneesheer ging heen zonder hoop den zieke te redden,
maar hij voorzag toch geen dreigenden dood: hij zou 's anderen daags
namiddags terugkomen.
's Anderen daags scheen De Coster zijn nakend einde niet bewust te
zijn, want hij vroeg noch naar zijnen schoonbroeder, noch naar zijne
zuster, die hij aanbad. Doch hij wilde zich omringen van vrienden,
als om zijn lichaam en zijn hart te verwarmen. Hij liet deze roepen,
die in de nabijheid woonden: zoo werden Félix Bouré, de beeldhouwer,
en later ik zelf geroepen. Bouré was ziek; hij verwittigde zijn
broeder, mede een vriend van De Coster: de heer Bouré vond in het
werkkabinet kapitein Mertens die, diep bedroefd, in de kamer van den
zieke niet dorst gaan. Deze betoonde een levendige erkentelijkheid
aan den heer Bouré, die zijn bed wat gemakkelijker schikte en hem te
drinken gaf. Toen ik en mijne vrouw op onze beurt kwamen, richtte De
Coster zich op in zijn bed en herkende mij heel goed. Kloekmoedig in
het aanschijn van den dood, had hij nog het gedacht om den heer Bouré
en mij aan elkander voor te stellen. De heer Bouré bevestigde mij dat
hij, toespeling makend op mijn beroep van advocaat, eenige Latijnsche
woorden mompelde. Maar zijn blik verduisterde, zijne ademhaling werd
hijgend; toen mijne vrouw hem naderde om zijn hoofdkussen te schikken
en zijn voorhoofd te verfrisschen, moest hij eene inspanning doen om
heur te herkennen: "Hoe, gij ook, mevrouw, ik dank u zeer!" Daarna
werd de ademhaling flauwer, een laatste naam, die zijner zuster,
kwam pijnlijk over zijne lippen: "Ca...ro...line". Het was zijn hart,
dat ontsnapte. Het was twee uren.
Hector Denis.
VOORREDE VAN DEN UIL [1]
Heeren kunstenaars, heeren uitgevers, heer dichter, ik heb u eenige
aanmerkingen te doen aangaande uwe eerste uitgave. Hoe! in dat
lijvige boek, in dien olifant dien gij met achttienen naar den roem
tracht te drijven, hebt gij het kleinste plaatsje niet gegund aan
den vogel van Minerva, den wijzen, omzichtigen uil! In Duitschland
en in dat Vlaanderen dat gij zoozeer bemint, reis ik gedurig op den
schouder van Uilenspiegel, die maar aldus genoemd wordt, omdat zijn
naam bediedt: Uil en Spiegel, wijsheid en komediespel. Die van Damme,
waar hij geboren werd, naar men zegt, spreken uit: Ulenspiegel, door
samentrekking en de gewoonte die zij hebben u in stee van Ui uit te
spreken. Dat is hunne zaak.
Gij hebt eene andere uitlegging uitgedacht: Ulen voor U lieden Spiegel,
de Spiegel van U, boeren en heeren, geregeerden en regeerders, de
spiegel van de dwaasheden, de belachelijkheden, de misdaden van een
tijdstip. Dat was vernuftig, maar onredelijk. Men moet nooit afbreken
met den slenter.
Misschien vondt gij het vreemd de wijsheid te verbeelden door een--naar
uwe meening--treurigen, belachelijken vogel, een gebrilden schoolvos,
een kermis-grappenmaker, een vriend der duisternis, dien men niet
hoort vliegen en die doodt zonder dat men hem hoort komen, evenals de
Dood. Nochtans gelijkt gij op mij, huichelaars die lacht met mij. In
menige uwer nachten stroomde het bloed onder de slagen der Moord,
die op vilten zolen liep, opdat men heur ook niet zoude hooren komen.
Brak, in uw aller geschiedenis, nooit geen bleeke dageraad aan, die met
zijn vale schemering de met lijken van mannen, vrouwen en kinderen
bedekte straatsteenen verlichtte? Waarvan leeft uwe Staatkunde,
sedert dat gij over de wereld regeert? Van worgen en moorden.
Ik, uil, de leelijke uil, ik dood om mij te spijzen, om mijne jongen
te spijzen, ik dood niet om te dooden. Verwijt gij mij de vogeltjes
op te peuzelen, dan kan ik u even goed de slachting verwijten die
gij aanricht onder alles wat leeft. Gij hebt boeken geschreven waarin
gij met verteedering spreekt over de lichtheid van de vogelen, over
hunne minnarijen, over hunne schoonheid, over de kunst waarmede zij hun
nestje bouwen, en over de angsten des moederschaps, vervolgens zegt gij
met welke saus men ze moet opdienen en in welke maand van het jaar zij
de vetste stoverij opleveren. Ik, ik maak geen boeken, God beware mij
daarvoor, anders schreef ik dat, als gij den vogel niet kunt opeten,
gij het nest opeet, uit vreeze dat gij een hap zoudt verliezen.
Wat u betreft, onbesuisde dichter, het was uw belang mij terug te
brengen in uw werk, waarvan ten minste twintig hoofdstukken mij
toebehooren [2] de andere laat ik u in onbetwisten eigendom. Men mag
toch wel het volstrekt meesterschap behouden over de domheden die
men laat drukken. Schreeuwende dichter, gij slaat links en rechts op
die welke gij de beulen des vaderlands heet, gij stelt Keizer Karel
en Philips II aan den schandpaal der geschiedenis; gij zijt geen
uil; gij zijt niet voorzichtig. Weet gij of er geen Keizer Karel
of geen Philips II op de wereld meer bestaan? Vreest gij niet dat
eene opmerkzame censuur uit den buik van uwen olifant toespelingen
op doorluchtige tijdgenooten vinde? Waarom laat gij dien Keizer en
dien Koning niet slapen in hun graf? Waarom moet gij al die majesteit
aanblaffen? Die het zweerd trekt, zal door het zweerd vergaan. Er zijn
menschen die het u nooit zullen vergeven, ik ook vergeef het u niet,
gij stoort mijne burgerlijke spijsvertering.
Wat beteekent die bestendige tegenstelling tusschen een verfoeiden
koning, wreedaardig van jongs af--daarom is het een mensch--en
dat Vlaamsche volk, dat gij ons wilt voorstellen als heldhaftig,
gulhartig, eerlijk en werkzaam? Wie zegt u dat die koning slecht en
dat volk goed was? Wijselijk zou ik u het tegenovergestelde kunnen
bewijzen. Uwe hoofdpersonages zijn dwazen of zotten, zonder er een
uit te zonderen: uw deugniet van Uilenspiegel neemt de wapenen op
voor de gewetensvrijheid; zijn vader Klaas sterft, laat zich levend
verbranden voor zijne godsdienstige overtuiging; zijne moeder, Soetkin,
kwijnt van verdriet en sterft ten gevolge van de foltering, om een
fortuin voor haren zoon te bewaren; uw Lamme Goedzak stapt recht door
het leven alsof het al was, goed en eerlijk op deze wereld te zijn;
uwe kleine Nele, die niet leelijk is, bemint in heel haar leven maar
een enkelen man.... Waar ziet men nog zulke dingen? Ik zou u beklagen,
zoo ge mij niet deedt lachen.
Nochtans moet ik bekennen dat naast die bespottelijke personages, er
wel eenige zijn die ik geerne onder mijne boezemvrienden zoude nemen:
uwe Spaansche huurlingen, uwe monniken die het gemeen verbranden,
uwe Gilline, spionneerster der Inquisitie, uw gierige vischverkooper,
aanklager en weerwolf, uw edelman die 's nachts duivel speelt om eene
onnoozele te verleiden, en vooral dien omzichtigen Philips II, die,
geld noodig hebbende, de heilige beelden in de kerken doet breken,
ten einde een opstand te beteugelen waarvan hij de wijze aanstoker
was. Minder kan men toch niet, als men geroepen is te erven van
degenen die men doodt.
Maar ik geloof dat al mijne woorden verloren moeite zijn. Gij weet
niet wat een uil is. Ik ga het u zeggen.
De uil is hij die in 't geniep, eerroof stookt onder de lieden
die hem hinderlijk zijn en die, als men hem vraagt of hij de
verantwoordelijkheid over zijne gezegden wil dragen, voorzichtig
antwoordt: Ik bevestig niets, Men heeft mij gezegd.... Hij weet wel
dat Men onvindbaar is.
Uil is hij die een eerlijk gezin binnendringt, zich aanstelt als
een trouwer, een meisje verleidt, geld ontleent, soms zijne schuld
betaalt en henengaat als er niets meer te nemen is.
Uil, de politieke man die een masker van vrijheid, van oprechtheid,
van menschenliefde opzet en die, op een gegeven oogenblik, zonder te
verwittigen, een man of eene natie zachtjes de keel toeworgt.
Uil, de koopman die zijnen wijn doopt, zijne eetwaren vervalscht,
een kwade maag brengt daar waar spijsverteering,--woede, daar waar
vroolijkheid was.
Uil, hij die behendig steelt, zonder dat men hem bij den kraag vatten
kan, valsch getuigt tegen de waarheid, de weduwe ten onder brengt,
de weeze stroopt, en zegepraalt in 't vet, lijk anderen zegepralen in
't bloed.
Uilin, zij die hare schoonheid verkoopt, de beste harten van
jongelieden vermorst, dat heeten: de jeugd vormen, en ze zonder eenen
cent, achterlaat in het slijk waarin zij hen sleepte.
Als ze ooit treurig gestemd is, zich ooit herinnert dat ze vrouw is,
moeder zoude kunnen zijn, dan verloochen ik heur. Als ze, dat bestaan
moede, in 't water springt, dan is zij eene zinnelooze, die niet
verdiende te leven.
Zie rondom u, domme schrijver, en tel, als gij kunt, de uilen van deze
wereld; bedenk of het voorzichtig is gelijk gij het doet, van Macht
en List, die koninginnen der uilen, aan te vallen. Kom tot inkeer,
zeg mea culpa en vraag op uwe knieën om vergiffenis.
Nochtans hebt gij mijne belangstelling gewonnen door uwe onbesuisdheid,
vol zelfvertrouwen; tegen mijne gekende gewoonten in, verwittig ik u
dan ook dat ik, op staanden voet, de grofheid en roekeloosheid van
uwen stijl ga aanklagen bij mijne neven in letterkunde, die eene
sterke pen, eene stoute tong en voortreffelijke brillen hebben, en
zeer voorzichtige en pedante lieden zijn, die uwen trant niet gewoon
zijn en hunne taal zoozeer kuischen, dat er ten lange laatste niets
zal van overblijven. [3]

EERSTE BOEK.
I.
In meimaand, als de hagedoorn in bloei stond, werd te Damme, in
Vlaanderenland, Uilenspiegel, de zoon van Klaas geboren.
Terwijl Katelijne, de vroedvrouw, hem in warme doeken bakerde, bezag
ze zijn hoofd en riep ze blijde uit:
--Hij is met den helm geboren!
Maar weldra jammerend, met den vinger een zwart stipje op den schouder
van den boorling toonend:
--Laas! schreide zij, dat is het zwarte merk van den vinger des
duivels!
--Heer Satan is vandaag vroeg opgestaan, antwoordde Klaas, dat hij
alreeds den tijd vond om mijn zoon te teekenen?
--Satan sliep nog niet, zei Katelijne, want luister, nu eerst kraait
Kanteklaar de hennen wakker.
En zij gaf het kind over aan Klaas en ging naar buiten.
De dageraad verdreef nu het nachtelijk duister, de zwaluwen vlogen
kwetterend rakelings over de weide, en de zon kleurde vuurrood
de kimme.
Klaas deed het venster open en sprak tot Uilenspiegel:
--Kind met den helm, zie, daar is moeder de Zon, die Vlaanderenland
komt groeten. Bezie haar als uwe kijkers zullen open zijn; verkeert
gij later ooit in twijfel, weet gij niet wat te doen om goed te doen,
ga dan om raad bij de Zonne; zij is warm en helder: wees zoo goed
als zij warm, zoo eerlijk als zij helder is.
--Klaas, mijn man, zei Soetkin, ge spreekt tot een doove; kom en drink,
mijn jongen.
En de moeder stak den boorling hare schoone, blanke borsten toe.
II.
Terwijl Uilenspiegel zich laafde aan de levensbron, ontwaakten al de
vogelkens in 't veld.
Klaas, die mutsaards bond, bezag zijne vrouw, die Uilenspiegel de
borst gaf.
--Zeg eens, vrouw, sprak hij, hebt ge nog veel van die lekkere melk?
--De kruiken zijn vol, man, antwoordde zij, maar dat is niet voldoende
om mijn hert te verblijden.
--Gij spreekt zoo treurig en het is zoo vroeg nog in den morgen.
--Ik denk er aan, dat er geen oortje meer steekt in de tassche,
die daar aan den muur hangt.
Klaas nam de tassche van den wand; maar hij had goed schudden, er
rinkelde geen geld in. Hij was er onthutst over; doch hij wilde zijne
vrouw moed inspreken, en zei:
--Waarover bekommert gij U? Hebben wij in de schapraai den koek
niet liggen, dien Katelijne ons gisteren gaf? Zie ik daar geen groot
stuk vleesch, dat ten minste voor drie dagen goede melk aan 't kind
zal geven? Die zak boonen daar in den hoek, is die een voorteeken
van hongersnood? En dat kuipje boter bestaat toch niet in mijne
verbeelding? In mijne verbeelding ook niet, die appelen, welke,
met elven in 't gelid, op onzen zolder liggen? En de dikke tonne
schuimende Brugsche kuite, noodt zij ons niet, met haren vollen buik,
tot een gulle drinkpartij?
--Als 't kind gedoopt wordt, zei Soetkin, moeten er twee oortjes zijn
voor den pastoor en één gulden voor 't festijn.
Daarop kwam Katelijne het huis binnen met een grooten bundel kruiden
en zij sprak:
--Aan het kind bied ik de angelica, die den man voor ontucht behoedt
en de venkel, die Satan van hem verwijderd houdt....
--Hebt gij het kruideken niet, vroeg Klaas, dat guldens aantrekt?
--Neen, zegde zij.
--Dan ga ik zien of er iets in de vaart is te vinden.
Hij ging heen, met zijn hengel en zijn net, zeker dat hij niemand
ontmoeten zou, want het was nog een heel uur vóór oosterzon, wat in
Vlaanderen vijf uren zeggen wil.
III.
Klaas kwam aan de Brugsche vaart, niet verre van de zee. Hij schoof
het aas aan den haak, wierp de lijn uit en liet ook zijn net in 't
water zinken. Op den overkant der vaart lag een goedgekleede knaap
vast in slaap, op een bed van mosselen.
Op het gerucht, dat Klaas maakte, werd de jongen wakker; hij wilde
vluchten, meenende dat het een serjant der naburige gemeente was, die
kwam om hem te pakken en naar het Steen te brengen voor landlooperij.
Doch de schrik was verdwenen toen hij Klaas herkende, die hem toeriep:
--Wilt gij zes duiten verdienen? Ja?... Jaag dan de visch langs hier!
Op die woorden ging het knaapje, een kleine dikzak, het water in;
het trok er eenige lischbladeren, vatte ze tot een bundel samen en
joeg er mee de visch naar Klaas.
Toen de vangst gedaan was, trok Klaas net en lijn uit het water en
ging hij de sluis over naar het knaapje.
--Gij zijt het, zegde hij, die Lamme heet van uw doopnaam, en
Goedzak om den wille van uw zachtaardig karakter, en achter Onze
Lieve Vrouwekerk in de Reigerstraat woont? Hoe komt het dat gij,
zoo jong en zoo netgekleed, onder den blooten hemel slaapt?
--Laas! baas kooldrager, antwoordde het jongetje, ik heb thuis eene
zuster, die een jaar jonger is dan ik en mij troef geeft bij den
minsten twist. Maar op haren rug durf ik mijne weerwraak niet nemen,
want ik zou haar zeer doen, baas. Gisterenavond, onder het eten,
wischte ik met mijne vingers een teil uit, waarin ossenvleesch met
boonen geweest was, en zij wou er heur deel van hebben. Daar was niet
eens genoeg voor mij, baas. Als ze mij zag likkebaarden om den goeden
smaak der saus, werd ze razend en sloeg ze met de volle hand mij zóó in
't gezicht, dat ik heel bebloed het huis uitgeloopen ben.
Klaas vroeg hem wat zijn vader en zijne moeder zeiden, terwijl hij
zoo geslagen werd.
Lamme Goedzak antwoordde:
--Vader stompte mij op den eenen schouder en moeder klopte mij op den
anderen, roepende: "Verweer u, laffe Lamme". Maar ik wil geen meisje
slaan en daarom ben ik weggeloopen.
Eensklaps verbleekte Lamme en beefde hij als een riet.
En Klaas zag een lange vrouw afkomen, met een mager meisje naast zich,
dat er barsch uitzag.
--Ah! zuchtte Lamme, terwijl hij Klaas bij zijne hooze vastgreep, daar
komen moeder en zuster mij halen. Bescherm mij toch, baas kooldrager!
--Dáár, sprak Klaas, neem eerst die zes duiten voor uwe moeite en
heb geen vrees.
Toen de twee vrouwen Lamme zagen, liepen zij naar hem toe, en beiden
wilden hem slaan, de moeder omdat hij haar onrust aangedaan had en
de zuster uit gewoonte.
Lamme verschool zich achter Klaas en riep:
--Ik heb zes duiten verdiend, ik heb zes duiten verdiend, slaat
me niet!
Doch de moeder kuste haren jongen reeds, terwijl het meisje Lamme's
handen wilde openwringen, om hem zijn geld af te nemen. Maar Lamme
schreeuwde:
--'t Is 't mijne, ge zult het niet hebben.... 't Is 't mijne!
En hij balde de vuisten.
Toen trok Klaas de kleine meid geducht bij de ooren en sprak:
--Als het u nog voorvalt leed te doen aan uw broer, die goed en zacht
is als een lammeken, steek ik u in een donker kolenhok, en daar zal
ik u niet meer bij de ooren trekken, maar de roode duivel uit de hel;
hij zal u aan stukken scheuren met zijn groote klauwen en zijne tanden,
die op vorken gelijken.
Op die woorden dorst de meid Klaas niet meer te bezien, noch
heuren broeder te naderen; zij verborg zich achter de rokken heurer
moeder. Doch in de stad schreeuwde zij het overal uit:
--De kooldrager heeft mij geslagen; hij heeft een duivel in zijn
kelder.
Nochtans dorst zij Lamme niet meer slaan; maar als zij groot was,
deed ze hem haar werk doen. En de goede sul gehoorzaamde gewillig.
Onderweg had Klaas zijne vangst verkocht aan een pachter, een
lekkerbek, en thuis komende, zegde hij tot Soetkin:
--Zie, dat heb ik gevonden in den buik van vier snoeken, negen karpers
en in een volle ben paling.
En hij smeet twee gulden en een oortje op tafel.
--Man, waarom gaat gij niet alle dagen visschen? vroeg Soetkin.
Klaas antwoordde:
--Wel, omdat ik zelf niet geerne zou spartelen in de netten van de
stadsserjanten.
IV.
Te Damme werd Uilenspiegel's vader "Klaas de kooldrager"
geheeten. Klaas had zwart haar, schitterende oogen; zijn vel was van
de kleur zijner koopwaar, uitgenomen op Zon- en feestdagen, als er
veel zeep in de stulp was. Hij was klein, hoekig, sterk en blijgezind.
Als zijn werk gedaan was en hij met den valavond naar eene taveerne
van den Brugschen steenweg ging, om met kuite zijn keelgat te spoelen,
dat zwart was van koolstof, riepen al de vrouwen, die, op den dorpel
van heur deur den koelen avond genoten, hem vriendelijk toe:
--Goên avond en klaar bier, kooldrager!
--Goên avond en 'nen man die niet slaapt, antwoordde Klaas.
De meisjes die in troepjes van het veld kwamen, stelden zich vóór hem,
lieten hem niet door en vroegen hem:
--Wat geeft ge om er door te mogen: een scharlaken lint, een vergulden
gesp, fluweelen schoentjes of een gulden in ons beursje?
Maar Klaas nam er eene om haar middel en kuste heur wangen of heur
hals, al naarvolgens zijn mond het dichtst bij de donzige huid was,
en dan zegde hij:
--Vraagt, mijne hertjes, vraagt de rest aan uwe minnaars.
En schaterlachend gingen de joelende meisjes voort.
De kinderen herkenden Klaas aan zijn grove stem en aan zijn zwaren
stap. Zij liepen naar hem toe en zeiden:
--'n Avond, kooldrager!
--Van 's gelijken, mijne engelkens, zei Klaas; maar komt niet te dicht,
of 'k maak U zwart als moorkens.
De stoute kaboutermannekens kwamen toch nader; dan nam Klaas er een
bij zijn wambuis, streek zijn zwarte hand over 't gladde gezichtje
en liet hem zoo loopen, tot groote vreugd van de schaterende bende.
Soetkin, Klaas' wijf, was een brave, wakkere vrouw, die opstond met
de zon, en vlug en vlijtig was als een bij.
Zij en Klaas bebouwden getweeën hunnen akker en spanden zich als ossen
vóór den ploeg. Zwaar was het om hem voort te trekken, doch zwaarder
nog trok de egge, die met hare houten tanden den harden grond moest
scheuren. Toch deden zij het blij te moede, met een liedeken op
de lippen.
En de grond mocht nog zoo hard zijn en de zon hare heetste stralen
op hen neerschieten: zij konden water en bloed zweeten als zij de
egge trokken dat hunne knieën knikten--al hun lijden vergaten zij,
als zij even stil stonden en Soetkin heur zacht gelaat naar Klaas
keerde, want dan kuste Klaas den spiegel van die teedere ziele.
V.
Den vooravond had men van de pui van 't gemeentehuis uitgeroepen dat
Mevrouw, echtgenoote van keizer Karel, zwanger was en dat er gebeden
voor hare aanstaande verlossing moesten worden opgezegd.
Gansch huiverend kwam Katelijne bij Klaas binnen.
--Wat scheelt er? vroeg de kooldrager.
--Laas! sprak zij met hijgenden boezem. Dezen nacht zag ik spoken,
die menschen maaiden gelijk de hooiers het gras.--'k Zag meisjes
levend begraven! En de beul danste op de lijken!--De bloedsteen,
die sedert negen maanden zweette, is dezen nacht gebarsten.
--Erbarming, zuchtte Soetkin, erbarming, Heere God: wat duister
voorteeken voor Vlaanderenland!
--Ziet gij dat met uwe oogen of in droom? vroeg Klaas.
--Met mijne eigen oogen, sprak Katelijne.
Doodsbleek en schreiend sprak Katelijne toen:
--Twee kinderkens zijn geboren; het een, in Spanje, is de kleine
Philippus, het ander, in Vlaanderenland, is de zoon van Klaas,
die later Uilenspiegel zal heeten. Philippus wordt een beul, want
hij werd verwekt door Karel den Vijfde, den moordenaar van ons
land. Uilenspiegel wordt een meester in kwinkslagen en guitenstreken,
maar goedhertig zal hij zijn, want zijn vader is Klaas, de wakkere
arbeider, die in braafheid, eer en deugd zijn brood verdient. Keizer
Karel en koning Philippus zullen hun leven lang kwaad doen, door
oorlog en knevelarij en andere misdaden. Klaas, die heel de week werkt,
zal leven volgens recht en wet, bij zijn zuren arbeid zal hij lachen
in stee van weenen: hij zal het zinnebeeld van de goede Vlaamsche
werkers zijn. Uilenspiegel, immer jong en onsterfelijk, gaat de wereld
door, maar nergens zal hij een vaste woonplaats hebben. En hij zal
boer, edelman, schilder, beeldhouwer worden, alles zal hij te gelijk
zijn. Zoo zal hij dolen langs velden en wegen, het goede en het schoone
prijzen en lachen en spotten met alles wat dwaas en verkeerd is. Klaas
is uw moed, edel volk van Vlaanderen, en Soetkin uwe dappere moeder;
Uilenspiegel is uw geest; een lief en bevallig meisje, Uilenspiegel's
gezellin en onsterfelijk als hij, zal uw hert zijn, en Lamme Goedzak,
een dikke pens, uwe maag. En omhoog zullen de opeters van 't volk gaan,
en omlaag hunne slachtoffers; omhoog de roovende wespen, omlaag de
noeste bijen, en in den hemel zullen de wonden van Christus bloeden.
Toen Katelijne, de goede tooveres, dit gezegd had, viel zij in slaap.
VI.
Uilenspiegel werd ten doop gebracht, toen plotseling een hevige
regenbui viel, die hem gansch nat maakte. Zoo werd hij voor de eerste
maal gedoopt.
Als hij nu de kerk binnengebracht werd, kwam de kosterschoolmeester
aan peter en meter, vader en moeder zeggen, dat zij zich rond de
doopvont moesten scharen, hetgeen zij deden.
Maar boven de vont, was er in 't gewelf een gat, dat een metser gekapt
had om er eene lamp aan een vergulde sterre te hangen. De metser, die,
van boven, peter en meter stokstijf rond de toegedekte vont zag staan,
goot verraderlijk door het gat een emmer water, dat, tusschen hen, met
groot geplas op het deksel van de vont kletste. Doch Uilenspiegel kreeg
er het grootste deel van. En zoo werd hij voor de tweede maal gedoopt.
De deken kwam; zij deden hem hun beklag, maar hij zei hun van zich te
haasten, dat het een ongeluk was. Uilenspiegel ging te werk als een
bezetene, om den wille van het water, dat op hem gespat was. De deken
gaf hem het zout en het water en heette hem Thijlbert, wat zeggen wil:
"altijd ongedurig". En zoo werd hij voor de derde maal gedoopt.
Uit Onze Lieve Vrouwekerk ging men daar rechtover, in de Langestraat,
eene taveerne binnen, die voor uithangbord een rozenkrans had, met
eene pint in het midden. Zij dronken er zeventien pinten dobbele kuite
en nog meer. Want in Vlaanderen, als men nat is, droogt men zich met
een vuur van bier in den buik. Zoo werd Uilenspiegel voor de vierde
maal gedoopt.
Met het hoofd zwaarder dan 't lichaam, strompelden ze huiswaarts;
zoo kwamen ze aan een brugje over eenen poel; Katelijne, die
meter was, droeg het kind; zij struikelde en viel in de modder met
Uilenspiegel. Zoo werd hij voor de vijfde maal gedoopt.
Men trok hem uit den poel. In 't huis van Klaas werd hij met lauw
water gewasschen. Dit was zijn zesde doopsel.
VII.
Dien dag besloot Zijne Heilige Majesteit keizer Karel, groote feesten
te houden, om de geboorte van zijn zoon te vieren. Evenals Klaas,
besloot hij uit visschen te gaan, niet in de vaart, doch in de beurzen
en tasschen zijner onderdanen. Daaruit is het dat vorstelijke lijnen
gouden karolussen, gouden lammeren, rozenobels, dubloenen, zilveren
daelders en al die wonderbare visschen trekken, die, naar willekeur
van den visscher, veranderen in fluweelen kleederen en schitterende
edelgesteenten, in lekkeren wijn en smakelijke gerechten. Want de
rivieren, die 't rijkst zijn aan visch, zijn niet die, waarin het
meeste water is.
Nadat Zijne Heilige Majesteit zijn raad bijeengeroepen had, besloot
hij, dat de vangst volgenderwijze geschieden zou:
De genadige infant zou rond negen of tien uren ten doop gebracht
worden; ten blijke van groote vreugde, zouden de inwoners van
Valladolid heel den nacht, op eigen kosten, feesten en kermissen,
en ten bate der armen, hun geld op de Groote Markt strooien.
Op vijf punten zou eene fontein, tot aan den dageraad toe, goeden
wijn spuiten, die door de stad moest betaald worden. Op vijf andere
plaatsen zouden, op houten kramen, allerhande worsten, ossetongen en
pasteien uitgestald worden, mede ten laste van de stad.
Op eigen kosten zouden de lieden van Valladolid, op den doortocht van
den stoet, in grooten getale zegebogen oprichten, den Vrede, het Geluk,
den Overvloed, de Fortuin voorstellend, en allerhande zinnebeeldige
toespelingen op de gaven des hemels, waarmede zij onder de regeering
van Zijne Heilige Majesteit begunstigd waren.
Ten slotte en behalve deze bogen van pais, zouden er andere opgericht
worden, waarop, in helle kleuren, minder goedertieren kenteekenen
zouden prijken, zooals arenden, leeuwen, lansen, hellebaarden,
vlammende spiesen, kanonnen, falkonetten, slangen met wijden mond,
mitsgaders al ander oorlogstuig, om op zinnebeeldige wijze de macht
en de kracht van Zijne Heilige Majesteit voor te stellen.
En, voor het verlichten der kerk zou, als een blijk van de genade
Zijner Majesteit, aan het gilde der keersgieters toegestaan worden,
voor niet, over de twintig duizend waskeersen te leveren, waarvan de
onopgebrande einden naar 't kapittel zouden gaan.
Al de andere kosten zou de keizer zelf betalen, om aldus te toonen,
dat het Zijner Goedertierenheid behaagde, zijne volkeren niet te zeer
te belasten.
Als de gemeente die bevelen uitvoerde, kwamen jammerlijke tijdingen uit
Rome. Oranje, Alençon en Frundsberg, bevelhebbers van den keizer,
waren binnen de heilige stede gedrongen en hadden er kerken,
kapellen en huizen verwoest en geplunderd, niemand, priesters,
nonnen, moeders noch kinderen, sparend. Den Heiligen Vader hadden zij
gevangengenomen. De plundering duurde reeds een volle week; ridders en
landsknechten doolden door Rome, zwelgend en brassend, met de wapens
zwaaiend, op zoek naar de kardinalen, roepende en tierende, dat zij
hen allen derwijze verminken zouden, dat geen hunner ooit paus zou
worden. Enkelen hadden die bedreiging reeds ten uitvoer gebracht en
dweilden langs de straten met halssnoeren van acht-en-twintig of meer
bloedige bollen, groot als okkernoten. De wegen leken roode beken,
waarin de verminkte lijken der vermoorden lagen.
Onder het volk werd gezegd, dat de keizer, die geld noodig had, er
wilde visschen in het bloed van de priesters, en dat hij bekend met
het tractaat, den gevangen paus door zijne bevelhebbers opgelegd, hem
dwong afstand te doen van al de versterkte plaatsen zijner Staten,
400.000 dukaten te betalen en gevangen te blijven totdat aan die
voorwaarden voldaan was.
Nochtans was de droefheid van Zijne Majesteit zoo groot, dat hij al
de toebereidselen van vreugde, feesten en vermakelijkheden afzegde
en den heeren en edelvrouwen van zijn huis beval den rouw aan te nemen.
En de infant werd gedoopt in zijn witte doeken, ten teeken van
koninklijken rouw.
Dat alles aanschouwden de heeren en edelvrouwen als voorteekenen
van rampspoed.
Desniettemin toonde de voedster den infant aan de edelen en edelvrouwen
van het koninklijk huis, opdat zij hem, naar aloud gebruik, hunne
wenschen en giften zouden bieden.
Mevrouw de la Coena hing om zijn hals een zwarten steen tegen het
vergif, zoo rond en zoo groot als eene hazelnoot, in een gouden
ring gevat; Mevrouw de Chaussade bond aan een zijden draadje eene
schelp, wolfsmuil geheeten, hangende op zijne maag, voor de goede
spijsvertering; messire Van der Steen, uit Vlaanderen, bood hem een
Gentsche worst, vijf ellebogen lang en een halven dik, en wenschte
daarbij hoogstnederig aan Zijne Hoogheid, dat hij, alleen op den
reuk van de worst, dorst mocht krijgen naar Gentschen klauwaard,
daarbij voegende dat, al wie het bier eener stad lust, de brouwers
niet kan haten; messire jonker Jacob Christoffel van Castilië bad
Zijne Hoogheid den Infant een groenen jaspis aan zijn doorluchtige
voetjes te willen dragen, opdat hij goed zou kunnen loopen. Jan de
Paepe, de nar, die daar ook was, sprak toen:
--Messire, geef hem liever den horen van Jozua, op wiens geschal al de
steden, met alles wat er in was aan mannen, vrouwlieden en kinderen,
zich in beweging zetten en liepen. Want Zijne Hoogheid moet niet
leeren zelf te loopen, maar wel de anderen te doen loopen.
De bedrukte weduwe van Floris van Borsele, in leven heer van Veere
in Zeeland, schonk aan Zijne Hoogheid Philippus eenen steen die,
naar zij zegde, de eigenschap had de mannen verliefd en de vrouwen
ontroostbaar te maken.
Maar de infant schreide zonder ophouden.
Uilenspiegel schreide ook, maar Klaas stak hem een wisschen klater
met belletjes in de hand, deed hem op zijne hand dansen en sprak:
Klingelingeling, hadt gij maar altijd belletjes aan uw kaproen,
mijn zoon, want de gekken zijn meester van de wereld.
En Uilenspiegel lachte zijn vader toe.
VIII.
Klaas had een grooten zalm gevangen, die op een Zondag gegeten werd
door hem en ook door Soetkin, Katelijne en den kleinen Uilenspiegel;
doch Katelijne at niet meer dan een vogelken.
--Maar, zei Klaas tot haar, is Vlaanderens lucht tegenwoordig zoo
voedzaam, dat gij maar moet ademhalen om gespijsd te wezen als met
een teil vleesch? Wanneer zal men kunnen leven zonder eten? De regen
moest goede soep zijn, de hagelsteenen erwten en de sneeuw stoverije;
dat zou den armen pelgrims versterking geven.
Katelijne schudde zwijgend het hoofd.
--Maar, moet gij daar zoo jammerend zitten? zei Klaas. Wat scheelt
er aan?
Toen sprak Katelijne met eene stem, zacht als een ademtocht:
--De booze geest, de zwarte nacht valt neer.--Daar meldt hij zijne
komst, met het geschreeuw van den nachtuil.--Rillend aanroep ik--te
vergeefs--de Heilige Maagd.--Voor hem, muren noch hagen, deuren noch
vensters.--Licht als een geest, dringt hij overal binnen.--Krakende
ladder.--Hij is bij mij, op den zolder waar mijne legerstee staat.--Hij
grijpt mij in zijn koude armen, als marmer zoo hard.--IJskoud is zijn
gelaat, en zijn kussen vochtig als de sneeuw.--De stroohut schudt en
slingert als een schuitje op de woelige zee....
--Elken morgen, zei Klaas, moet gij ter misse gaan, opdat de Heer
Jezus U de kracht geve dat helsche spook te verjagen.
--Hij is zoo schoon! sprak zij.
IX.
Als Uilenspiegel gespeend was, groeide hij op lijk een boom.
Dan kuste zijn vader hem zoo dikwerf niet meer, maar voedde hem streng
op, opdat hij geen weekeling worden zou.
Als Uilenspiegel thuis kwam en kloeg, dat hij, bij een of anderen
twist, klop gekregen had, kreeg hij er nog klop bij van Klaas,
omdat hij de anderen niet geklopt had: en, aldus opgebracht, kreeg
Uilenspiegel den moed van een jongen leeuw.
Als Klaas er niet was, vroeg Uilenspiegel aan Soetkin een duit om te
spelen. Dan was Soetkin boos en sprak:
--Waarom moet ge gaan spelen? Blijf liever thuis, om mutsaards
te binden.
En als zij niets gaf, begon Uilenspiegel te blaten als een lam. Maar
Soetkin maakte dan veel leven met potten en pannen, om te gebaren
dat ze hem niet hoorde. Dan weende Uilenspiegel, en de zoete moeder
liet hare geveinsde hardheid af, kwam tot hem, streelde hem en vroeg:
"Hebt gij genoeg met een denier?" Nu, gij moet weten, dat een denier
zes duiten gold.
Zoo beminde zij hem te veel en, als Klaas er niet was, was Uilenspiegel
baas in huis.
X.
Op een morgen zag Soetkin haren man met gebogen hoofd in de keuken
staan, in gedachten verdiept.
--Wat scheelt er toch, man? vroeg zij. Ge ziet bleek, gij zijt kwaad
en verstrooid.
Met eene stem, als een hond die bromt, antwoordde Klaas:
--De wreede plakkaten des keizers gaan ze weer uithalen. Opnieuw gaat
de dood over Vlaanderenland heerschen. De aanbrengers krijgen de helft
van de have der slachtoffers, als de have de honderd karolusgulden
niet te boven gaat.
--Wij zijn arm, sprak zij.
--Arm, zeide hij,... niet arm genoeg. Er zijn lage zielen, gieren
en raven, die ons zouden aanklagen, zoowel om een zak kolen als om
een zak karolussen met Zijne Majesteit te deelen. Wat bezat het arme
Tanneken, de weduw van Sies den kleermaker, die ze te Heist levend
begroeven? Een Latijnschen bijbel, drie gouden florijnen en wat potten
van Engelsch tin, waarop eene buurvrouw loerde. Wantje Martens werd
eerst in 't water geworpen; haar lijf dreef boven, en daarin zag
men hekserij, weshalve zij als tooveres verbrand werd. Zij had wat
gebroken meubelen, zeven gouden karolussen in een lederen tassche,
en de aanklager vroeg er de helft van. Eilaas! nog tot morgen zou ik
aldus kunnen spreken: maar wat baat het, vrouw: in Vlaanderen is het
leven onhoudbaar om den wille van de plakkaten. Welhaast zal telken
nacht de kar van den Dood dof door de straten rijden en wij zullen
zijne beenderen hooren rammelen.
Soetkin sprak:
--Jaag me geen schrik aan, Klaas. De keizer is de vader van Vlaanderen
en Brabant; als dusdanig is hij braaf en grootmoedig, geduldig
en genadig.
--Daarbij zou hij te veel verliezen, antwoordde Klaas, want de
verbeurdverklaarde goederen komen hem bij erfenis toe.
Plotseling hoorde men de trompet en de cimbels van den
stadsuitroeper. Op dat geluid kwamen Klaas en Soetkin, die beurt om
beurt Uilenspiegel op den arm droegen, met de volksmenigte toegeloopen.
Zoo kwamen zij aan het schepenhuis. Voor de pui waren de herauten te
peerd, op bazuinen blazend en op cimbels slaande, de provoost met de
roede der justitie in de hand en de stadsprocureur, ook te peerd,
die eene ordonnantie des keizers in de hand hield en zich gereed
maakte ze aan vergaderde volksmenigte voor te lezen.
Klaas vernam, dat het andermaal aan allen in 't algemeen en aan elk in
't bijzonder verboden was, te drukken, te lezen, in bezit te hebben of
voor te staan, de boeken, schriften of leerstellingen van Martinus
Luther, van Joannes Wycliff, Joannes Huss, Marcilius van Padua,
Æcolampadius, Ulricus Zwinglius, Philippus Melanchton, Franciscus
Lambertus, Joannes Pomeranus, Otto Brunselsius, Justus Jonas, Joannes
Pupperis en Gorcianus, de Nieuwe Testamenten gedrukt door Adriaan
van Bergen, Christoffel van Roemonde en Joannes Zell, vol Luthersche
en andere heresiën, verworpen en veroordeeld door de Faculteit der
godgeleerdheid van de Universiteit van Leuven. Mitsgaders te maken of
te doen maken smadelijke konterfeitsels of afbeeldsels van God, van de
heilige Maagd Maria of van de santen; te breken, te scheuren of uit te
wisschen de beelden of konterfeitsels, vervaardigd tot verheerlijking
van en tot aandenken aan God en de Maagd Maria of de heiligen der kerk.
Verder zei het plakkaat, dat het aan niemand toegelaten was, tot welken
staat hij ook mocht behooren, zich te vermeten de Heilige Schrifture te
bespreken of over haar te twisten, zelfs niet op twijfelachtige punten,
tenzij door een godgeleerde van naam, erkend door eene Universiteit,
daartoe gemachtigd.
Onder andere straffen besliste Zijne Heilige Majesteit, dat
de verdachten nooit of nimmer een eerbaar ambt zouden kunnen
bekleeden. En zij, welke in hunne dolingen hervielen of bleven
volharden, zouden veroordeeld worden met een zacht of hard vuur,
in een strooien huis of gebonden aan een paal te worden verbrand,
al naar de sententie van den rechter. De anderen zouden omgebracht
worden door het zweerd als zij edelen of goede burgers waren, de
gemeene manslieden aan de galg geknoopt en de vrouwlieden levend
begraven. Om tot voorbeeld te strekken, zou hun hoofd op een paal
worden gestoken. Ten profijte van den keizer was er verbeurte hunner
goederen, overal waar verbeurdverklaring geschieden kon.
Zijne Heilige Majesteit schonk den aanbrengers de helft van al
hetgene de aflijvigen in eigendom bezeten hadden, zoo die have de
somme van honderd pond grooten, Vlaamsche munte, alles in 't alles,
niet te boven ging. En wat aanging het deel van den keizer, dit
zou hij aanwenden voor werken van godsvrucht en van bermhertigheid,
gelijk bij de plundering van Rome was geschied.
En treurig keerde Klaas naar huis, met Soetkin en Uilenspiegel.
XI.
Daar het een jaar van voorspoed geweest was, kocht Klaas voor zeven
florijnen een ezel en negen halsters boonen, en op een morgen besteeg
hij zijn beest. Uilenspiegel zat van achteren. Aldus gingen zij hun
oom en oudsten broeder, Judocus Klaas, bezoeken, die woonde omtrent
Meiborg, in de Duitsche landen.
Judocus, die in zijne jeugd eenvoudig en zacht van aard was geweest,
had door vele geleden onrechtveerdigheden haat tegen de menschen
opgevat en leefde in eenzaamheid.
Zijn vermaak was, twee zoogezeid trouwe vrienden met elkander te doen
vechten, en hij gaf drie oortjes aan hem, die zijn vriend het ergst
toegetakeld had.
Ook bracht hij geerne, in een warme kamer, in grooten getale,
twistzieke oude wijven bijeen en gaf haar geroosterd brood en
kruidenwijn.
Aan de vrouwen, die meer dan zestig jaar oud waren, stelde hij saaie
ter hand, die zij in een hoek moesten opbreien; daarbij beval hij haar
altijd aan, de nagels lang te laten groeien. En 't was wonderlijk
ze te hooren kuchen, babbelen, snappen en, met hare priemen onder
de oksels, te zamen den naam en de eer van den evennaaste te hooren
schenden en rooven.
Wanneer Judocus zag, dat zij goed in gang waren, smeet hij eenen
borstel in 't vuur, die door het schroeien der haren de lucht met
een geweldigen stank vervulde.
Dan begonnen de wijven al te gelijk te kijven en elkaar te beschuldigen
de oorzaak te zijn van den stank: en allen streden het af en vlogen
weldra elkander in 't haar; en dan wierp Judocus opnieuw borstels in
het vuur en paardenhaar op den vloer. Als het gevecht zoo verwoed en
de rook zoo dik werd, en het stof zoo hoog steeg, dat hij niets meer
zien kon, ging hij zijne twee in stadsserjanten verkleede knechts
halen, die de ouden als woedende ganzen met groote stokslagen uit de
kamer verdreven.
En toen Judocus het slagveld overzag, vond hij er lappen van rokken,
van kousen, van hemden en ook oude tanden.
En droefgeestig zei hij tot zich zelven:
--Mijn dag is verloren, niet eene van haar heeft hare tong
achtergelaten.
XII.
In het baljuwschap Meiborg ging Klaas door een smal boschje: de
ezel hapte hier en daar naar een distel; Uilenspiegel smeet zijne
kaproen naar de vlinders en ving ze weer op, zonder van den ezel te
komen. Klaas at eene snede brood en nam zich voor, die in de naaste
taveerne te begieten. Van verre hoorde hij een klokje kleppen en een
gedruisch als van vele menschen die altegader spreken.
--'t Is eene bedevaart, en de heeren pelgrims zijn zeker in grooten
getale. Houd u goed vast, mijn zoon, dat zij u niet van het grauwtje
stooten. Wij zullen zien. Komaan, ezeltje, wat gauwer, toe!
En de ezel draafde.
Zij verlieten den zoom van het bosch en daalden naar een groote vlakte,
ten Westen door eene rivier bespoeld. Aan den Oosterkant stond een
kleine kapel, den gevel versierd met een beeld der Lieve-Vrouwe, met
twee stieren aan heure voeten. Op de trappen van de kapel stonden een
heremiet--die giegelend, aan 't kleppen was--vijftig staffieren met
brandende keersen in de hand, spelers, klokluiders en trommelslagers,
klaroenblazers, pijpers, schalmei- en doedelzakspelers, alsmede een
hoop lustige gezellen, die bakken vol oudroest in de handen hielden,
doch voor het oogenblik allen stille zwegen.
Meer dan vijf duizend pelgrims, in gesloten gelederen, elk van zeven
man, met helmen op en stokken van groen hout in de hand, gingen hen
voorbij. Dan schaarden zij zich, telkens zeven, vóór de kapel. Zij
lieten hunne stokken zegenen en kregen elk eene keers uit de handen
der staffieren, in ruil waarvan zij den heremiet een halven florijn
betaalden.
En hunne processie was zoo lang, dat de keersen van de eersten
opgebrand waren, toen die van de laatsten nog hare volle lengte hadden.
Klaas, Uilenspiegel en de ezel verlustigden zich met aldus een groote
verscheidenheid breede, hooge, lange, puntige, fiere, ronde of slappe
buiken te zien voorbijgaan.
Al de pelgrims hadden helmen op. Er waren er die van Troje kwamen,
andere, die phrygische mutsen leken. Sommige pelgrims hoewel met bolle
wangen en dikke buiken, droegen helmen met uitgespreide vleugelen,
doch hadden geenerlei zin tot vliegen. Anderen waren gekapt met
zoogenaamde "salades", door de slakken onwaardig gekeurd omdat ze
niet groen genoeg waren.
Maar het meerendeel had helmen, zoo oud en verroest, dat ze uit den
tijd schenen te zijn van Gambrinus, koning van Vlaanderen en koning
van het bier, dewelke regeerde negenhonderd jaar vóór Christus en eene
pint op zijn hoofd droeg, uit vrees niet op tijd te kunnen drinken,
bij gebrek aan een beker.
Eensklaps begonnen klokken, pijpen, schalmeien, trommelen en het
oudroest te kleppen, te fluiten, te schallen, te slaan en te kletteren.
Het was het sein voor de pelgrims zich omme te keeren en bij groepen
van zeven zich nu tegenover elkaar te plaatsen. Als uitdaging stak elk
de brandende keers in het gelaat van zijn overman. Daardoor ontstond
groot genies en daarna regende het stokslagen.
Ze vochten en sloegen met handen en voeten, met hoofden, met alles. Er
waren er, die, gelijk de rammen, op hunne tegenstrevers vielen, met
den helm vooruit, die bij den eersten schok over hunne ooren schoot,
en als blinden terechtkwamen op zeven andere woedende pelgrims,
die hen verwelkomden, maar niet met zachtheid.
Anderen, schreeuwers en bloodaards, jammerden om de ontvangen slagen,
maar bij het prevelen hunner gebeden werden ze bliksemsnel door nieuwe
zeventallen overvallen en zonder genade omvergeloopen of omvergetrapt.
En de heremiet lachte.
Verderop zag men zeventallen, die als klissen aan elkaar hingen en
van boven naar beneden in het water rolden; maar zij bleven elkaar
toetakelen en ranselen, zonder dat het water hunne woede bekoelde.
En de heremiet lachte.
Zij, die boven gebleven waren, sloegen elkander de oogen blauw en de
tanden vaneen, rukten elkanders haren uit, en scheurden wambuizen en
hoozen aan stukken.
En de heremiet lachte en sprak:
--Dapper aan, vrienden: wie 't hardst slaat, bemint het meest. Aan de
kloekste vechters, de schoonste liefjes! Hier ziet Onze Lieve Vrouw
van Rindbisbels, wie man is!
En de pelgrims sloegen als op kaf.
Middelerwijl was Klaas den heremiet genaderd, terwijl Uilenspiegel
lachend en gierend op de slagen bleef toekijken.
--Eerwaarde vader, vroeg hij, welke misdaad hebben die arme sukkelaars
bedreven, om elkander zoo wreedelijk te mishandelen?
Doch zonder hem te aanhooren, riep de heremiet:
--Luieriken! gij verliest den moed. Als de vuisten moede zijn, zijn
de voeten het immers nog niet! Zijn er onder U, die beenen hebben om
te vluchten als hazen? Wat doet het vuur uit de steenen springen? Het
ijzer, dat er op slaat!
Op die woorden gingen die onnoozele pelgrims voort te vechten met
helmen, met handen en met voeten. 't Was een verwoede strijd, waarvan
Argus met zijn honderd oogen niets hadde gezien dan stofwolken en
hier en daar de punt van een helm.
Doch eensklaps begon de heremiet te kleppen. Pijpen, trommelen,
trompetten en schalmeien en het oudroest staakten hun gedruisch,
tot teeken van vrede.
De pelgrims brachten nu hunne gekwetsten bijeen. Er waren er, wier
tong, gezwollen van gramschap, uit den mond hing. Maar die ging van
zelve in hare verblijfplaats terug. Moeilijker was het om de helmen
af te trekken, die tot ver over de ooren zaten. Zij schudden den kop
en bleven hem schudden: de helmen waren vast gelijk groene pruimen
aan den boom.
Doch toen sprak de heremiet:
--Leest elkeen een ave en keert terug naar uw wijf. En binnen negen
maanden zullen evenveel kinderen meer in het baljuwschap zijn, als
heden 't gevecht dappere strijders telde.
En de heremiet zong het ave voor, en allen zongen het mee. En de
klok klepte.
De heremiet zegende hen in name van Onze Lieve Vrouwe van Rindbisbels
en sprak tot de pelgrims:
--Gaat in vrede!
En roepend en stompend en zingend, trokken zij naar Meiborg terug. Al
de vrouwen, oude en jonge, wachtten hen op den dorpel van de huizen,
waar zij binnenvlogen als soldeniers in een stormenderhand veroverde
stad.
De klokken van Meiborg luidden al te gader: de jongens floten, riepen,
speelden op den rommelpot.
Pinten en stoopen, bekers en glazen gingen lustig aan 't klinken en
rinkelen. En de wijn vloeide in de kelen als een stroom in de zee.
Terwijl de klokken luidden en de wind, bij vlagen, aan Klaas 't gezang
van mannen, vrouwlieden en kinderen bracht, vroeg hij opnieuw aan den
heremiet, welke hemelsche gratie die sukkelaars hoopten te verkrijgen,
na die hardhandige oefeningen.
Lachend antwoordde hem de heremiet:
--Op die kapel daar, ziet ge twee gekapte beelden, die twee stieren
voorstellen. Zij staan daar ter herinnering aan het mirakel van den
heiligen Martinus, die twee ossen in stieren veranderen deed, door
hen met de horens te doen vechten. Daarna streek hij meer dan een
uur keersvet over hunnen snuit, en sloeg er met den stok op.
Welnu, ik kende het mirakel. Ik vroeg Zijne Heiligheid om eene
vergunning, die ik duur betaalde en kwam mij vestigen in dit oord.
Toen preekte ik over het wonder en weldra kregen al de mannen, zoo
ouden als jongen, de zekerheid dat Onze Lieve Vrouwe hun genadig was
als ze goed gevochten hadden met de keers die de zalf, en den stok die
de kracht is. Hierheen is het, dat de vrouwen heuren man sturen. De
kinderen, die uit kracht van de bedevaart verwekt zijn, worden vlug
en wreedaardig, geweldig en roekeloos en, later, vrome soldaten.
Eenklaps vroeg de heremiet aan Klaas:
--Herkent gij mij?
--Ja, sprak Klaas, gij zijt mijn broeder Judocus.
--Gij zijt er, antwoordde de heremiet, maar wie is die bengel daar,
die leelijke gezichten naar mij trekt?
--'t Is uw neef, was 't antwoord van Klaas.
--Welk verschil maakt gij tusschen keizer Karel en mij?
--'t Is groot, sprak Klaas.
--'t Is klein, wedervoer Judocus: de keizer doodt de menschen en bij
mij krijgen ze klop, tot ons beider profijt en vermaak.
Dan bracht hij Klaas en Uilenspiegel naar zijne kluis, waar zij elf
dagen achtereen kermis vierden.
XIII.
Als Klaas afscheid nam van zijn broer, steeg hij op zijn ezel, met
Uilenspiegel achter zich. Op de Markt van Meiborg stonden velerhande
pelgrims en als zij hen zagen, ontstaken ze in woede en hieven de
stokken dreigend omhoog. En allen riepen "Schelm! Nietdeug!" om
den wille van Uilenspiegel, die zijne hooze losgemaakt en zijn hemd
opgetrokken had, en zijne achterkaken liet zien.
Klaas, ziende dat ze zijn zoon bedreigden, vroeg hem:
--Wat hebt gij gedaan, dat zij zoo kwaad op u zijn?
--Vadertjelief, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, ik zit op den ezel en zeg
tot niemand een woord, en toch schelden ze mij uit voor een nietdeug.
Toen deed Klaas hem langs voren zitten.
In die postuur stak Uilenspiegel de tong uit naar de pelgrims, en
roepend en tierend balden ze hunne vuisten en dreigden met hunne
stokken Klaas en den ezel.
Maar Klaas sloeg op zijn ezel om hunne woede te ontvlieden. Toen de
pelgrims hen met rust lieten, sprak Klaas tot zijn zoon:
--Gij zijt onder een zeer slecht gesternte geboren, want gij zit vóór
mij, doet niemand kwaad en toch willen ze u dooden!
Uilenspiegel hield zijn buik vast van 't lachen.
Terwijl Klaas door 't Land van Luik reed, hoorde hij zeggen, dat
die van Rivage hongersnood leden en dat ze gesteld waren onder
de jurisdictie van den officiaal, eene vierschaar van geestelijke
rechters. Zij maakten opstand om brood en om wereldlijke rechters
te bekomen. Eenigen werden onthoofd of gehangen, anderen uit het
land gebannen; dàt was de goedertierenheid van den zachtzinnigen
aartsbisschop, den hoogweerdigen Van de Marck.
Klaas zag onderwege de gebannenen, die de zoete vallei van Luik
ontvloden, en, aan de boomen, omtrent de stad, zag hij de lijken van
hen die gehangen waren, omdat zij de misdaad begaan hadden, honger
te hebben. En Klaas schreide over hunnen rampspoed.
XIV.
Toen Klaas op zijn ezel weer thuis kwam met een zak vol oortjes,
dien hij van zijn broeder gekregen had en ook met een schoonen beker
van Engelsch tin, was 't Zondag en weekdag kermis in de arme stulp;
alle dagen at men boonen met vleesch.
Menigmaal vulde Klaas den schoonen beker met schuimende dobbele kuite.
Uilenspiegel at voor drie; hij ging en kwam naar de borden en teilen
als eene musch op een graanzolder.
Eet gij het zoutvat niet mee? vroeg Klaas.
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Wanneer, gelijk hier, het zoutvat gemaakt is van een uitgeholde
korst brood, moet men het soms opeten, anders komen er wormen in.
--Waarom, zegde Soetkin, veegt gij uwe vettige handen af aan uwe hooze?
--Aan mijne hooze? wel, om nooit met natte billen te loopen.
Daarop dronk Klaas een groote teug bier uit zijn tinnen beker.
Uilenspiegel vroeg hem:
--Waarom hebt gij zoo'n grooten beker en ik maar een klein kroezeken?
Klaas antwoordde:
--Omdat ik uw vader en de baas van het huis ben.
Doch Uilenspiegel hernam:
--Gij drinkt al veertig en ik nog maar negen jaar; gij hebt al genoeg
gedronken en mijne beurt is gekomen. Geef mij den beker en neem gij
het kroezeken.
--Zoon, sprak Klaas, men giet geen vat bier in een vaatje over
zonder morsen.
--Nu ga dan te werk met verstand en giet uwe kan in mijn tonne,
want mijn buik is grooter dan uw beker, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
En lachend liet Klaas hem zijn beker ledigen. En zoo leerde
Uilenspiegel listig worden om bier te krijgen.
XV.
Onder haren gordel droeg Soetkin het kenmerk van een nieuwe
bevruchting; ook Katelijne was zwanger, maar zij dorst heur huis
niet verlaten.
Soetkin ging haar bezoeken.
--Ach! sprak zij jammerend, wat ga ik aanvangen met de ongelukkige
vrucht van mijn lichaam? Moet ik het wichtje versmachten? Ik zou
het besterven! Maar zoo ik een kind heb zonder getrouwd te zijn,
zullen de serjanten mij pakken. Ik zal, als een ontuchtige deerne,
twintig gulden moeten betalen, en op de groote markt gegeeseld worden.
Om haar te troosten, sprak Soetkin heur eenige zoete woorden
toe. Bezorgd en nadenkend keerde zij huiswaarts. Op een morgen sprak
zij tot Klaas:
--Zoudt ge mij slaan, Klaas, als ik u twee kindjes schonk in stee
van maar één?
--Dat weet ik niet, antwoordde Klaas.
--Maar, sprak Soetkin, als het tweede kindje niet uit mijn lichaam
kwam en, gelijk dat van Katelijne, verwekt was door een onbekende,
door den duivel misschien?
--De duivel, antwoordde Klaas, verwekt wel vuur en dood en rook,
maar geen kinderen. Het kind van Katelijne zal ik als het onze aanzien.
--Zoudt gij dat? vroeg zij.
--Gelijk ik u zeg, hernam Klaas.
Soetkin ging die goede mare aan Katelijne kondschappen en uiterst
gelukkig en opgetogen riep deze uit:
--De goede man heeft gesproken voor 't heil van mijn lichaam. God zal
hem zegenen, en ook de duivel, sprak zij huiverd, als 't een duivel
is, die U verwekte, arm schaapje, dat in mijn boezem leeft.
Soetkin bracht een zoon en Katelijne eene dochter ter wereld. Beiden
werden ten doop gebracht als zoon en dochter van Klaas. De knaap werd
Hans genoemd, maar bleef niet in leven; het meisje werd Nele geheeten
en groeide flink op.
Aan vier bekers dronk zij levenssap: aan de borsten van Soetkin en
aan die van Katelijne. En een zoete strijd ontstond tusschen de twee
vrouwen, om de kleine de borst te mogen geven. Maar tot haar groot
leed, moest Katelijne heure melk laten verdrogen, want men hadde heur
gevraagd van waar die kwam, zonder dat zij moeder was.
Als Nele gespeend was, nam Katelijne heure dochter bij zich en liet
haar niet eerder naar Soetkin gaan, dan nadat zij heur "moeder"
genoemd had.
En de buren zeiden, dat het schoon was van Katelijne, die have en
goed bezat, het kind op te voeden, want Soetkin en Klaas leefden
veelal in kommer en armoe.
XVI.
Op zekeren morgen was Uilenspiegel alleen thuis. Hij verdroot zich
geweldig, en nam een schoen van zijn vader, om er een schuitje van
te maken. De groote mast stond reeds vast in de zool en Uilenspiegel
ging een gat snijden in 't overleer, om den boegspriet te plaatsen,
toen hij over 't halfdeurken het hoofd van een ruiter en den kop van
een peerd zag.
--Is hier niemand? vroeg de ruiter.
--Ja, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, een mensch, een halve mensch en een
paardekop.
--Hoezoo? vroeg de ruiter.
Uilenspiegel sprak:
--Wel, ik zie hier een heelen mensch en die ben ik; verder zie ik
een halven mensch, te weten, uw hoofd en borst, en daarbij nog den
kop van uw peerd.
--Waar zijn uw vader en moeder? vroeg de man.
--Vader gaat van kwaad tot erger en moeder is bezig met ons in scha
of schande te brengen.
--Dat begrijp ik niet, sprak de ruiter.
Uilenspiegel hernam:
--Vader graaft de voren van zijn land dieper, om de jagers, die zijn
koren plat trappen, van kwaad in erger te doen vallen. Moeder is geld
gaan leenen: geeft zij te veel weer, dan is het ons scha en geeft ze
te weinig, dan is het ons schande.
Toen vroeg de man hem den weg.
--Daar, waar de eenden gaan, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
De ruiter ging heen, doch als Uilenspiegel bezig was met van Klaas'
tweeden schoen eene galei te maken, kwam hij terug.
--Gij hebt mij bedrogen, sprak hij; daar waar de eenden zijn, is het
modder en veengrond, waarin zij ploeteren.
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Ik zei u niet van te rijden waar zij ploeteren, doch daar waar
zij gaan.
--Wijs mij ten minste den weg, die naar Heist gaat, sprak toen de man.
--In Vlaanderen, zei Uilenspiegel, zijn 't de menschen die gaan,
en de wegen blijven liggen.
XVII.
Op zekeren dag sprak Soetkin tot Klaas:
--Man, ik heb den dood op het lijf. 't Is nu al drie dagen, dat Thijl
uit den huize is. Waar mag hij wel zijn?
Treurig antwoordde Klaas:
--Hij is waar de straathonden zijn, op den grooten weg, met nietdeugen
van zijne soort. God was vol wreedheid, toen hij ons zulk een zoon
gaf. Toen Thijl ter wereld kwam, zag ik in hem de vreugd van onzen
ouden dag, een werktuig te meer in ons huis; ik meende hem een
handwerk te leeren, maar 't boosaardige noodlot maakt hem tot een
schelm, een dagdief.
--Wees niet te gestreng, man, sprak Soetkin. Onze zoon is maar negen
jaar, hij is nog in den roes van de eerste jeugd. Moet hij, als de
boomen, niet eerst zijne hulsels afwerpen, alvorens zich te kunnen
tooien met zijne bladeren, die, voor den boom des volks, de eer en de
deugd zijn? 't Is een kleine guit, ik weet het, maar zijne slimheid zal
hem later te goede keeren, als hij ze tot een of ander goed ambacht
aanwendt, in stee van ze tot kwade parten te gebruiken. Hij steekt
geerne den draak met een ieder; maar later zal hij zijn plaats vinden
in een lustige broederschap. Hij lacht gedurig; maar de gezichten,
die zuur zien vóór hunne rijpheid, zijn een slecht voorteeken voor
later. Zoo hij loopt, is 't dat hij zulks noodig heeft om te groeien;
zoo hij niet werkt, is het dat hij nog niet begrijpt, dat werken een
plicht is en als hij somwijlen dag en nacht, een halve week uitblijft,
is het dat hij niet beseft hoeveel verdriet hij ons aandoet, want
hij heeft een goed hart en ziet ons geerne.
Klaas schudde het hoofd en antwoordde niet, en toen hij sliep,
lag Soetkin te weenen. En 's morgens, als zij dacht dat haar zoon
wellicht ergens aan den weg ziek lag, ging zij op den dorpel der
deure zien of hij niet afkwam; maar zij zag hem niet en zij zette
zich aan 't venster, om van daar naar de straat te kijken. En meer
dan eens bonsde heur het hert in de borst, als zij den lichten stap
van een kind hoorde; maar als de kleine voorbijging en zij zag dat
het Uilenspiegel niet was, weende zij weer, de arme moeder.
Doch Uilenspiegel was, met zijn deugnieten van kameraden, te Brugge
op de Zaterdagsmarkt.
Daar zag men leerzenmakers en schoenlappers in hunne kramen,
kleermakers met hoozen, wambuizen, bovenkerels; Antwerpsche
meezenvangers, die 's nachts met een uil ter vogelvangst gaan; daar
waren kooplui in wild, hondenvangers, verkoopers van kattevellen voor
handschoenen, borstlappen en kragen, en koopers uit alle standen,
poorters en poorteressen, knechten en dienstmaagden, broodmeesters,
botteliers, eierboeren en -boerinnen en men hoorde ze, ieder op zijn
wijs, vragen en bieden, de waren prijzen en afkeuren.
In een hoek van de markt was een schoone lijnwaden tente opgericht op
vier palen. Aan den ingang van die tente stond een boer uit het Land
van Aalst--met twee monniken naast zich om het geld te ontvangen--die
voor een oortje aan de nieuwsgierigen een stukje van het schouderblad
van de heilige Maria van Egypte liet zien. Met schorre, heesche stemme,
roemde hij de verdiensten der gelukzalige; in zijnen lofzang vergat
hij zelfs niet te zeggen hoe ze eens, bij gebreke aan geld, een jongen
veerman, die haar overgezet had, betaalde met schoone munt der nature,
om Gods gebod, omtrent het loon der werklieden, niet te overtreden.
En de twee monniken knikten om te bevestigen, dat de boer waarheid
sprak. Naast hen stond een groot, dik wijf, met een rood gezicht,
als Astarte zoo wulpsch, een oorverdoovend lawaai te maken op een
gebarsten doedelzak, terwijl een lieftallig meisje naast haar zong
als een nachtegaaltje, doch op haar lette niemand. Aan den ingang
van de tent wiegelde eene kuip, met de beide ooren aan twee staken
vastgemaakt. Als het wijf in hoogdravende woorden vertelde, dat het
eene kuip wijwater was, die van Rome kwam en de monniken weer knikten
om hare woorden te staven, verviel Uilenspiegel in diepe overpeinzing.
Aan een van de palen der tente stond een ezel gebonden, die meer hooi
dan haver kreeg: met hangenden kop zag hij naar de aarde, maar zonder
hoop er distels te zien opschieten.
--Jongens, riep Uilenspiegel, naar het wijf, de twee paters en 't
weemoedige grauwtje wijzend, vermits de meesters zoo goed zingen,
moet de ezel dansen. En hij liep naar een winkel, en kwam met zes
duiten peper. Toen hief hij den steert van den ezel op en wreef er
de peper onder.
Als het beest de peper gevoelde, keek het omme, om te zien van waar
die ongewone warmte kwam. Het meende, dat het den vuurduivel achter
de hielen had en wilde loopen om hem te ontvlieden; dan begon het
dier te balken en te stampen en uit al zijne kracht aan den paal te
trekken. Bij den eersten schok ging de kuip los, die tusschen de
twee haken hing, en al het wijwater kletste op de tent en op hen,
die er in waren. Weldra stortte de tent in en de aanwezigen, die naar
de geschiedenis van Maria van Egypte luisterden, lagen als onder een
natten mantel begraven. En Uilenspiegel en zijne vrienden hoorden van
onder het doek groote beroering en geweeklaag, want de geloovigen,
die binnen waren, beschuldigden malkander de kuip omvergetrokken
te hebben, en wit van woede brachten ze elkander vele vuistslagen
toe. Men zag het doek van de tente op en neer gaan, en telkens als
Uilenspiegel op het doek een ronden vorm zag uitkomen, stak hij er in
met eene speld. Dan hoorde hij grootere kreten en grootere uitdeeling
van vuistslagen onder de tente.
En hij had dolle pret en het meest toen hij den ezel zag wegloopen met
doek, met kuip en met palen achter zich aan, terwijl de baas van de
tent, zijn wijf en zijn kind zich vastklampten aan den sleep van den
ezel. Eindelijk kon het dier niet meer voort, het begon erbarmelijk
te balken en te stampen, en hield maar op om onder zijn steert te
zien of het vuur, dat er brandde, niet haast gebluscht was.
Maar de kwezelaars vochten voort en zonder aan hen te denken,
scharrelden de monniken het geld bijeen, dat uit de schaal gevallen
was.
Uilenspiegel hielp devotelijk mee, doch niet zonder profijt.
XVIII.
Terwijl de zoon van den kooldrager als een schalk opwies, bracht de
ziekelijke zoon van den grooten keizer zijne dagen in droefgeestigheid
door. Edelvrouwen en heeren zagen hem, door kamers en gangen van 't
paleis van Vallodolid, zijn armzalig lichaam op waggelende beentjes
voortsleepen, alsof hij moeite had de zwaarte te dragen van zijn
groot hoofd, met stekelig blond haar bedekt.
Steeds zocht hij de donkere gangen op en bleef er uren lang zitten, met
de beenen uitgestrekt. En als een dienstknecht er uit onachtzaamheid
op trapte, liet hij hem geeselen, en als hij hem hoorde huilen van
pijn, deed het hem goed, maar hij lachte niet.
's Anderen daags haalde hij elders in de gangen van het paleis
dezelfde streken uit. Edelvrouwen, heeren en schildknapen, die hem
voorbijgingen, deed hij struikelen, en als zij vielen en zich bezeerden
deed hem dat genoegen, maar hij lachte niet.
En zoo iemand hem aanraakte en niet viel, huilde hij alsof hij geslagen
was: en de ontsteltenis ziende, was hij blij, maar hij lachte niet.
Zijne Majesteit hierover verwittigd, beval, dat men geen acht op den
infant moest geven, zeggende, zoo hij niet wilde dat men hem trapte,
hij zijne voeten niet moest zetten waar eens anders beenen gingen.
Zulks mishaagde Philippus, doch hij zei niets; men zag hem niet meer,
tenzij in den tuin, wanneer hij, bij helderen zomer dag, zijn schraal
lichaampje in de zonne ging warmen.
En als keizer Karel, van den oorlog teruggekeerd, zijn zoon vol
somberheid zag zitten, sprak hij:
--Mijn zoon, hoe zeer verschilt gij van mij! Op uwen leeftijd klom ik
op de boomen achter de eekhoorntjes; met een koord liet ik mij langs
steile rotsen glijden om arendsnesten te ledigen. Ik kon er het leven
bij inschieten, maar mijn lichaam werd er des te sterker om. Op de
jacht vluchtten de wilde dieren, als ze mij zagen met mijn vuurroer.
--Ach! zuchtte de infant, 'k heb buikpijn, heer vader.
--Paxarete-wijn is een uitstekend geneesmiddel tegen de buikpijn,
sprak Karel.
--Dien wijn lust ik niet; 'k heb hoofdpijn, heer vader.
--Mijn zoon, zei Karel, gij moet loopen, springen, stoeien, zooals
de andere kinderen van uwen leeftijd doen.
--Mijne beenen zijn stijf, heer vader.
--Kan het anders? sprak Karel, gij maakt er houten beenen van. Wacht,
ik ga u vastbinden op een vurig peerd.
De infant weende.
--Bind mij niet vast, sprak hij, ik heb pijn aan de lenden, heer vader.
--Maar, vroeg Karel, hebt gij dan overal pijn?
--Het zou niets zijn, zoo men mij gerust liet, zegde de infant.
--Denkt gij soms, hernam de keizer ongeduldig, uw koninklijk leven als
de poëten in mijmering door te brengen? Laat hen hunne perkamenten
met inkt bemorsen, in stilte, eenzaamheid en bespiegeling; aan u
zoon van het zweerd, behoort het warme bloed, het oog van den arend,
de list van den vos, de kracht van een Hercules. Waarom maakt gij het
teeken des kruises? Een leeuwenwelp mag geen paternosterknauwer zijn!
--Het Angelus, heer vader, antwoordde de infant.
XIX.
Bloei- en Zomermaand waren dat jaar oprecht de maanden der
bloemen. Nooit zag men, in Vlaanderen, zulke welriekende hagedoornen,
in de hovingen zooveel rozen, jasmijn en kamperfoelie. Als de
Westenwind de geuren van dat bloemenland naar 't Oosten dreef, stak
iedereen, en meest nog in Antwerpen, verrukt den neus omhoog, zeggende:
--Riekt gij dien goeden wind, die uit Vlaanderen waait?
Onverpoosd waren de vlijtige bijen bezig met honig uit de bloemen te
zuigen, was te maken, het broedsel te verzorgen in de korven, te weinig
in aantal om al de zwermen te bergen. Heerlijke muziek van den arbeid
onder den blauwen hemel, die schitterend den rijken bodem overdekte!
Men maakte rieten, strooien, wisschen bijenkorven. Mandenmakers,
kuipers, stroovlechters arbeidden van den vroegen morgen. En de
kastenmakers konden bijlange het bestelde werk niet afdoen.
De zwermen bestonden uit dertig duizend werkbijen en twee duizend
zevenhonderd hommels. De honigraten waren zoo lekker en van zulke
zeldzame hoedanigheid, dat de deken van Damme er elf zond aan keizer
Karel, als dankzegging omdat hij, door zijne ordonnantiën de Heilige
Inquisitie weder ingevoerd had. Philippus at de honigraten op, maar
hij had er geen genot van.
Schooiers, bedelaars, rabauwen en heel die bende luiaards, die vadsig
langs de wegen slenteren en zich liever laten opknoopen dan zich aan
eenigerhande bezigheid over te leveren, kwamen van heinde en verre
aanloopen, verlekkerd door den honiggeur. En 's nachts zwierven zij
in groote menigte door velden en hoven.
Klaas had korven gemaakt om er bijenzwermen heen te lokken; eenige
waren gevuld, andere nog ledig. Klaas bleef heel den nacht waken om
op zijn goed te letten. Als hij moede was, zegde hij tot Uilenspiegel
zijne plaats in te nemen. Deze deed het gewillig.
Nu, op een nacht dat het koel was, kroop Uilenspiegel in een ledigen
korf, en gansch ineengedrongen, keek hij door de gaten die er van
boven in waren.
Op 't punt van insluimeren, hoorde hij de haag kraken en de stemmen
van twee manslieden, die hij voor dieven aanzag. Hij keek door een
der gaten van den bijenkorf en zag, dat de beide mannen lang haar
en een langen baard hadden, hoewel een lange baard te dien tijde een
teeken van adel was.
Zij gingen van korf tot korf, en zoo kwamen zij aan den zijnen en
hem optillende, spraken zij:
--Deze is de zwaarste; vervolgens staken zij er hunne stokken onder
en droegen hem mee.
Uilenspiegel vond het geenszins aangenaam, aldus in een bijenkorf
vervoerd te worden. De nacht was donker en de dieven spraken geen
woord. Alle vijftig stappen bleven zij staan om adem te scheppen en
zich vervolgens weder op weg te begeven. Die vóór ging gromde van
kwaadheid omdat de last zoo zwaar woog, en die van achteren, kermde
weemoedig. Want in de wereld zijn twee soorten luiaards: zij, die
kwaad zijn op den arbeid, en zij, die jammeren als er te werken valt.
Uilenspiegel, die niets te doen had, trok den dief, die vóór ging,
bij zijn haar, en den anderen bij zijnen baard, zoodat de grommer
den janker toeschreeuwde:
--Als gij niet ophoudt, aan mijn haar te trekken, geef ik u eene smete
op den kop, dat hij in uwe borstkas valt en gij door uwe ribben kunt
zien, als een dief door de traliën van het Steen.
--Ik deed het niet, vriend, jammerde de janker, gij zijt het die aan
mijnen baard trekt.
De grommer antwoordde:
--Ik zoek geen ongedierte in een schurftigen baard!
--Maat, sprak de janker, doe de korf niet zoo schommelen, mijne armen
houden het niet langer uit.
--Hewel, ik zal ze u van het lijf rukken. En hij trok zijnen riem over
zijn hoofd, zette den korf op den grond en sprong op zijn makker. En
zij vochten, de eene vloekend, de andere om genade smeekende.
Toen Uilenspiegel de slagen hoorde vallen, kroop hij uit den korf,
sleepte dien in een boschje, waar hij hem terugvinden kon, en keerde
toen huiswaarts.
En zoo is het, dat de slimmen voordeel halen uit twist en krakeel.
XX.
Als Uilenspiegel vijftien jaar oud was, bouwde hij te Damme, met
vier palen, eene kleine tent op, en riep dat een iegelijk er zijn
tegenwoordig en toekomstig gelaat kon afgebeeld zien, in een schoone
lijst van hooi.
Wanneer een opgeblazen rechtsgeleerde binnen kwam, zot van eigenwaan,
stak Uilenspiegel zijn hoofd door de lijst en bootste het gezicht
van een ouden aap na; dan sprak hij:
--Een ouden snuit kan rotten, maar geenszins bloeien; ben ik uw
spiegel niet, heer dokter in de rechten?
Als Uilenspiegel tot klant een oudgediende kreeg, liet hij, in stee
van zijn gezicht, in 't midden van de lijst een schotel vleesch en
brood zien, en sprak hij:
--De oorlog zal u tot gehakt maken; wat geeft gij mij om de
voorzegging, o snorrebaard, verzot op sakkers met wijden mond?
En als een oud heertje aan Uilenspiegel zijn poezelig wijfje liet
zien, verborg de snaak zijn gelaat nogmaals en toonde in de lijste een
boompje, aan welks takken messen, koffertjes, kammen en schrijfgerei
hingen, alles van hoorn vervaardigd, en zeide:
--Vanwaar komen die schoone snuisterijen, messire? is het niet van den
horenboom, die groeit in den boomgaard der oude manslieden? Wie zal
nog zeggen, dat horendragers van geenerlei nut zijn in de samenleving?
En Uilenspiegel toonde in de lijste, nevens den boom, zijn jeugdig
gezicht.
Als de ouderling hem hoorde, ontstak hij in hevige woede, doch zijn
vrouwtje paaide hem, en glimlachend vroeg zij aan Uilenspiegel:
--En mijn spiegel, wilt ge hem mij toonen?
--Kom nader, was 't antwoord.
Zij deed het. Toen kuste hij haar waar hij maar kon.
--Uw spiegel, sprak hij, is bloeiende jeugd in trotschheid gehuld.
En de schoone ging heen, en vergat niet hem een paar gulden te geven.
Aan een dikken monnik, die hem vroeg om zijn tegenwoordig en toekomstig
gezicht te zien, antwoordde Uilenspiegel:
--Gij zijt eene hespenkast, en een bierkelder zult gij ook zijn,
want zout noodt tot drinken, niet waar, dikzak? Geef mij een oortje,
omdat ik de waarheid zei.
--Mijn zoon, sprak de monnik, nooit dragen wij geld op ons.
--Dan is het, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, dat het geld u op zich draagt,
want mij is 't bekend, dat gij het steekt tusschen twee zolen, onder
den voet! Geef mij uw riemschoen.
Maar de monnik hernam:
--Mijn zoon, 't is het goed van het klooster. Maar als 't moet,
zal ik u toch twee oortjes geven voor uwe moeite.
De monnik gaf ze en Uilenspiegel nam ze minzaam aan.
Daarna toonde hij ook aan de lieden van Damme, van Brugge, van
Blankenberge, tot zelfs van Oostende, hunnen spiegel.
En in stee van te zeggen in Vlaamsche sprake: "Ik ben Ulieden spiegel",
zei hij kortweg: "Ik ben Ulen spiegel", gelijk thans nog gezegd wordt
in Oost- en West-Vlaanderen.
En zóó kwam hij aan zijn bijnaam Uilenspiegel.
XXI.
Grooter geworden slenterde hij geerne langs kermissen en
jaarmarkten. Zag hij ergens een hobo-, vedel- of doedelzakspeler,
dan liet hij zich voor een oortje leeren, hoe men uit die speeltuigen
welluidende tonen kan halen.
Zeer behendig werd hij in 't bespelen van den rommelpot, een speeltuig
gemaakt met een pot, eene blaas en een rietje, en wel als volgt:
over den pot spant men een natte blaas; een eind van het rietje
wordt met een touwtje gebonden in het middenste van de blaas en het
ander raakt den bodem van van den pot; vervolgens wordt de blaas tot
barstens toe om den pot gespannen. 's Anderen morgens, als de blaas
droog geworden is, kan men er op slaan als op een tamboerijn en zoo
men met het rietje wrijft, bromt het schooner dan de viool.
En Uilenspiegel ging met zijn rommelpot, die het geblaf van wachthonden
nabootste, aan de deur van de huizen kerstliederen zingen, in
gezelschap van kinderen, waarvan een, op Driekoningen, een blinkende
papieren ster droeg.
Als een meester-schilder te Damme kwam om de broeders van een of ander
gilde geknield op het doek te malen, bekroop Uilenspiegel de lust te
zien hoe hij werkte; daarom vroeg hij om zijne verf te mogen wrijven,
en als loon wilde hij slechts eene snee brood, drie duiten en eene
pint kuite aanveerden.
Terwijl hij de verf fijn wreef, ging hij de doenwijze zijns meesters
na. Als deze weg was, beproefde hij te schilderen, maar overal streek
hij scharlakenrood. Hij probeerde ook 't portret te maken van Klaas,
Soetkin, Katelijne en Nele, alsmede van pinten en stoopen. En Klaas
hem aan 't werk ziende, voorzeide, dat hij, zoo hij neerstig wou
zijn, florijnen bij tientallen zou kunnen verdienen met opschriften
te schilderen op de speelwagens in Vlaanderen en Zeeland.
Ook het houtsnijden en steenkappen leerde hij van een meester-metser,
terwijl deze, in het koor van Onze Lieve Vrouwekerk, eenen zetel
kwam maken, derwijze geschikt, dat de oude deken zitten kon zonder
dat iemand het merkte.
Uilenspiegel was het, die het eerst een messenhecht sneed, zooals de
Zeeuwen gebruiken. Hij maakte er een kunstig bewerkt snijwerk van,
met van binnen een doodshoofd en van boven een wakende hond. Hetgeen
zeggen wilde: het hecht getrouw tot aan den dood.
En alzoo begon zich de voorzegging van Katelijne te verwezenlijken,
want Uilenspiegel was nu tegelijk schilder, beeldhouwer, boer en ook
edelman: immers de Klaassen voeren, van vader tot zoon, drie zilveren
pinten in een veld van bruinbier.
Maar Uilenspiegel bleef in alles ongedurig en Klaas zei dat, als dat
spelletje zoo voortging, hij hem de stulp uit zou jagen.
XXII.
De keizer, van den oorlog teruggekeerd, vroeg waarom zijn zoon
Philippus hem niet was komen begroeten.
De aartsbisschop-leermeester van den infant antwoordde, dat hij niet
gewild had, dat hij slechts van boeken en eenzaamheid hield.
De keizer vroeg, wáár hij zich ophield.
De leermeester antwoordde, dat men hem overal zoeken moest, waar het
duister was. Zoo deden zij.
Als zij door menige zalen gegaan waren, kwamen zij eindelijk in een
somber verblijf, door een smal venster verlicht. En op den grond
stond een staak, waaraan een jong en lief aapje vastgemaakt lag,
een diertje dat Zijne Hoogheid uit Indië gekregen had om er mede te
spelen. Smeulende takkebossen lagen rondom en in het vertrek hing
een walm van verkoold haar.
Het diertje, levend verbrand, had zoo verschrikkelijk geleden, dat
zijn lichaampje niet geleek op dat van een wezen dat geleefd had,
maar op een stuk gewrongen en gerimpelden wortel. En op zijn mondje,
dat open was, als om genade te vragen, stond een bloedig schuim,
en zijn arm gezichtje was nat van zijne tranen.
--Wie heeft dat gedaan? vroeg de keizer.
De leermeester dorst niet antwoorden en beiden bleven sprakeloos,
droef en grammoedig staan.
Maar onverwacht werd de stilte door een lichten kuch gestoord, die uit
den donkersten hoek kwam. Zijne Majesteit keerde zich om en zag den
infant Philippus, in 't zwart gekleed bezig een citroen uit te zuigen.
--Don Philippus, sprak hij, kom hier om mij te groeten.
Zonder zich te verroeren, bekeek de infant hem met zijne vreesachtige
oogen, waar geenerlei liefde in blonk.
--Zijt gij het, vroeg de keizer, die dat diertje verbrand hebt?
De infant boog het hoofd.
--Waart gij wreedaardig genoeg om het te bedrijven, wees dan vrank
genoeg om het te bekennen.
De infant zweeg.
Zijne Majesteit ontnam hem den citroen, wierp dien op den grond
en wilde zijn zoon slaan, maar de aartsbisschop hield hem terug,
en fluisterde hem toe:
--Zijne Hoogheid zal later een groote ketterbrander zijn!
De keizer glimlachte en beiden gingen, den infant met zijn aapje
alleen latend.
Maar ook anderen, die geen aapjes waren, kwamen in vlammen om.
XXIII.
De Slachtmaand was gekomen, de kille hoestmaand der borstlijders.
't Is ook de maand, waarin de knapen bij benden over de rapenvelden
heenstormen, om te rooven wat zij kunnen, tot groote schade der boeren,
die ze tevergeefs achternazitten met stokken en vorken.
Op een avond nu dat Uilenspiegel van een strooptocht terugkwam,
hoorde hij in een hoek van den haag, dicht bij hem, een gekerm. Hij
bukte en zag, op eenen steen, een hondeken liggen.
--Wel, mijn beestje, sprak hij, wat doet ge hier zoo spa in den avond?
Hij wilde den hond streelen en hij voelde dat zijn rug nat was. Hij
dacht, dat men hem had willen verdrinken en nam hem in de armen,
om hem te drogen en te koesteren.
Thuis gekomen, sprak hij:
--Hier is een gekwetste, wat moet ik er mee doen?
--Hem verbinden, antwoordde Klaas.
Uilenspiegel zette den hond op de tafel. Klaas, Soetkin en hij zagen
toen, bij het licht van de lamp, dat het diertje eene wond op de
rug had. Soetkin wiesch ze, lei er balsem op en bond er een doek
om. Uilenspiegel nam den hond in zijn bed, hoewel Soetkin hem in
't hare wou hebben, bevreesd dat Uilenspiegel, die woelde als een
duivel in een wijwatervat, in zijn slaap het diertje zou bezeeren.
Maar Uilenspiegel deed zijne goesting; hij verzorgde zijn hond zóó
goed, dat de gekwetste na zes dagen liep zooals de meesten zijner
verwaande natuurgenooten, met den steert omhoog.
En de schoolmeester hiet hem Titus Bibulus Snuffius: Titus in memorie
van zekeren goeden Romeinschen keizer, dewelke dwalende honden placht
op te nemen; Bibulus, omdat de hond eene dronkemansliefde voor kuite
en bruinbier had, en Snuffius omdat hij steeds met den snoet in
rattenholen en mollenritten aan 't snuffelen was.
XXIV.
Aan het einde van de Onze-Lieve-Vrouwestraat stonden twee wilgeboomen
aan den boord van een diepe gracht.
Tusschen de twee wilgen spande Uilenspiegel eene koorde, waarop hij
op een Zondag na de vespers danste, zoo vlug, dat heel de menigte
van straatloopers in de handen kletste. Toen kwam hij beneden en ging
rond met zijn schaaltje, dat met geld gevuld werd, maar hij ledigde
het in de schorte van Soetkin, en hield elf duiten voor zich.
Den volgenden Zondag wilde hij weer op de koorde dansen, maar eenige
bengels, uit nijd over zijne behendigheid, hadden eene snee in de
koorde gegeven, zoodat zij na eenige sprongen brak en Uilenspiegel in
't water tuimelde.
Terwijl hij naar den oever zwom, riepen de kleine koordesnijders
hem toe:
--Hoe gaat het, Uilenspiegel-vlug? Gaat gij nu in den vijver den
karpers leeren dansen?
Uilenspiegel kwam uit het water en schudde zich af. En daar zij uit
angst voor een pak slaag wegliepen, riep hij hun toe:
--Vreest niets; komt Zondag terug, 'k zal U andere kunsten toonen en
gij zult uw deel in de winst hebben!
's Zondags nadien sneden de bengels de koorde niet door, doch hielden
er de wacht bij, opdat niemand ze aanraakte, want er waren toeschouwers
in groote menigte.
Uilenspiegel zei hun:
--Dat ieder mij een zijner schoenen geve, en 'k wed dat ik er mee dans,
zoowel met den grootsten als met den kleinsten.
--En wat betaalt gij, als gij verliest? vroegen zij hem.
--Veertien pinten bruinbier, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, maar gij betaalt
mij drie oortjes als ik win.
--Goed! riepen zij.
En zij gaven hem elk een hunner schoenen. Uilenspiegel legde ze alle
in het voorschoot dat hij aan had en, met dien last, danste hij op
de koorde, doch niet zonder moeite.
Van beneden riepen de koordesnijders:
--Gij hebt gezegd met elk onzer schoenen te zullen dansen; trek ze
aan en houd uwe wedding.
Uilenspiegel danste voort en antwoordde:
--Ik heb niet gezegd uwe schoenen aan te trekken, doch er mee te
dansen. Nu, ik dans, en alles danst mee in mijn voorschoot. Ziet gij
het niet met uwe paddenoogen? Betaalt mij mijn drie oortjes.
Doch zij jouwden hem uit en schreeuwden, dat zij hunne schoenen
moesten terughebben.
Uilenspiegel smeet ze alle te gelijk in een worp naar beneden. Een
woedend gevecht volgde, daar niemand zijn schoen dadelijk terugvinden
kon.
Uilenspiegel kwam naar beneden en begoot de vechters, maar niet met
klaar water.
XXV.
De infant, nu vijftien jaar oud, dwaalde als naar gewoonte door gangen
en trappen en zalen van 't slot. Doch meestal slenterde hij rond de
vertrekken der edelvrouwen, om de edelknapen te verschalken, die,
gelijk hij, als katten in de gangen op loer lagen. Andere jonkers
waren in den tuin, keken verzuchtend omhoog, en zongen eene ballade
van minne.
Als de infant het hoorde, vertoonde hij zich eensklaps aan een der
vensteren, en de arme edelknapen waren ontsteld als zij zijn bleeke
tronie zagen, in stee van de zoete oogen hunner schoonen.
Onder de edelvrouwen van het hof was een lieftallige dame, een
Vlaamsche van Dudzele, omtrent Damme, van ongemeene schoonheid en in
de volheid harer jaren, met oogen, groenig-bruin, en rossig, krullend
haar, dat schitterde als goud. Vroolijk van zin en vurig van aard,
verheelde zij niemand hare neiging tot den gelukkige, wien zij, op
heur aanbiddelijk erf, het hemelsch privilege van liefde schonk. De
uitverkorene heurs herten was een schoon en fier ridder. Elken dag
op vast uur, ging zij tot hem, hetgeen Philippus wist.
Hij zette zich op eene bank tegenover een venster en wachtte. En
als zij hem voorbijging met flikkerend oog en met rozeroode lippen,
en glanzend van jeugd en van liefde in haar kleed van goudbrocaat,
zag zij den infant, die, zonder zich van zijne plaats te verheffen,
tot haar zegde:
--Mevrouwe, hebt gij een oogenblik voor mij?
Driftig als de merrie, die in haren loop gestuit wordt op 't oogenblik
dat zij rent naar den schoonen hengst, die in den beemd hinnikt,
antwoordde zij:
--Hoogheid, een ieder moet gehoorzamen aan Uwen vorstelijken wil.
--Zet U naast mij, sprak de infant.
Onbeschaamd, listiglijk en onbermhertig zag hij haar aan:
--Zeg mij het Onze-vader in Vlaamsche tale; men heeft het mij geleerd,
laas! ik heb het vergeten.
De arme vrouw zegde een Vader-ons, doch tamelijk vlug, maar hij dwong
haar telkens tot langzamer spreken.
En aldus noodzaakte hij heur het tot tienmaal toe te zeggen, aan haar,
die op dit uur aan andere gebeden dacht.
Daarna sprak hij vleiend van heure schoone gouden lokken, van heure
heldere tint, heur klare oogen, maar niets dorst hij zeggen van
heur gevleesde schouderen, noch van haren fraai gevormden boezem,
noch van iets anders.
Zij meende te mogen heengaan en blikte reeds naar den tuin waar zij
haren minnaar wachtte, toen hij vroeg of ze wist welke de deugden
der vrouw zijn?
Daar zij niet antwoordde uit vreeze van verkeerd te spreken, deed
hij het in heure plaats, en zegde hij op den toon van een zedenpreeker:
--Deugden der vrouwe zijn kuischheid, eerzaamheid en ingetogenheid.
Hij ried haar aan zich zedig te kleeden en alles wat heur was,
zorgvuldiglijk te verbergen.
Zij knikte ten teeken van goedkeuring en zeide, dat zij zich voor
Zijne Noordpoolachtige Hoogheid liever met tien berenhuiden dan met
eene el neteldoek bedekken zou.
En terwijl hij onthutst was over dit antwoord, nam zij lachende
de vlucht.
Nochmaals was het vuur der jeugd in de borst van den infant ontbrand:
maar het was dit gloeiende vuur niet, dat de sterke zielen tot groote
daden drijft, noch het zoete vuur, dat de teedere herten doet weenen:
't was een somber vuur uit de helle, door Satan ontstoken. En het
glom in zijne grijze oogen, gelijk de maan boven een kerkhof, in
winternacht. En het brandde hem wreedelijk.
Daar de arme gluiperd geene liefde voor anderen voelde, dorst hij de
edelvrouwen niet aanspreken; toen ging hij naar een afgelegen hoekje,
in een kamertje, met witte muren, slecht verlicht, waar hij gemeenlijk
zijne lekkernijen at en waar een groote menigte vliegen waren, om den
wille van de brokkelingen. Daar streelde hij zichzelven, terwijl hij de
vliegen met den kop tegen de ruiten plette en er met honderden doodde,
totdat zijne vingeren te danig beefden om hunne bloedige bezigheid
voort te zetten. En in die wreede uitspanning vond hij een genot,
mits geilheid en wreedheid twee eerlooze zusteren zijn. Als hij
uit dat hok kwam, was hij nog somberder dan te voren en een ieder
ontvluchtte het bleeke gelaat van dien terugstootenden prins.
En de treurige Hoogheid leed, want slecht herte is smerte.
XXVI.
De schoone vrouwe verliet Valladolid om naar heur slot van Dudzele,
in Vlaanderen, te gaan.
Toen zij, met heuren dikken bottelier, door Damme trok, zag zij een
veertienjarigen knaap, met den rug tegen eene hut geleund, op eenen
doedelzak spelen. Rechtover hem zat een rosse hond, die jammerlijk
huilde, daar die muziek hem niet aanstond. De zonne stond schitterend
aan den hemel. Nevens den knaap zat een aanminnig meisje, dat, bij
elk erbarmelijk gehuil van den hond, in een gulhertigen lach schoot.
Toen de schoone vrouwe en de dikke bottelier voorbij de stulp kwamen,
bezagen zij Uilenspiegel, die blies, Nele, die lachte en Titus Bibulus
Snuffius, die jankte.
--Stoute jongen, sprak zij tot Uilenspiegel, wilt ge wel ophouden
dien armen hond zoo te doen huilen!
Maar Uilenspiegel bezag haar en blies nog harder op zijnen
doedelzak. En Bibulus Snuffius jankte nog jammerlijker, en Nele
schaterlachte nog luider.
De bottelier ontstak in woede, wees naar Uilenspiegel en sprak tot
de edelvrouwe:
--Als ik dat schavuitengebroed eens afroste met de schee van mijn
degen, zou de onbeschaamderik wel ophouden!
Uilenspiegel bezag den bottelier, hiet hem Jan Papzak, om den wille
van zijn dikken buik en ging voort met blazen op zijn doedelzak. De
bottelier liep op hem toe en dreigde hem met de vuist; maar Bibulus
Snuffius vloog op hem af en beet Papzak in het been; van schrik viel
de bottelier op den grond en schreeuwde om hulp.
De dame lachte Uilenspiegel toe en sprak:
--Kunt ge mij zeggen, doedelzakspeler, of de weg, die van Damme naar
Dudzele leidt, niet veranderd is?
Uilenspiegel bleef voortblazen, schudde den kop en bezag de edelvrouwe.
--Maar waarom ziet ge mij zoo strak aan? vroeg zij.
Doch hij speelde voort en sperde de oogen open, alsof hij voor heur
in bewondering stond.
--Zijt gij niet beschaamd, voor een jongen snaak als gij, de vrouwen
aldus te bezien?
Uilenspiegel bloosde een weinig, speelde voort en bekeek heur nog meer.
--Ik heb U gevraagd, hernam zij, of de weg niet veranderd is, die
van Damme naar Dudzele leidt?
--Weleer was hij groen, thans is hij droef en schraal, sedert hij
het geluk mist U te mogen dragen, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Wilt ge mij leiden?
Maar Uilenspiegel bleef zitten, haar steeds aanziende. En als ze hem
zoo snaaksch zag en zoo jong en zoo levendig, vergaf zij hem geerne
zijne woorden. Hij stond op om binnen te gaan.
--Waar gaat gij?
--Mijn beste kleeren aantrekken, antwoordde hij.
--Spoed U dan, sprak de edelvrouwe.
Toen zette zij zich neer op de bank naast de deur; de bottelier deed
zooals zij. Zij wilde tot Nele spreken, maar Nele antwoordde heur niet,
want zij was jaloersch.
Uilenspiegel kwam terug; hij was schoon gewasschen en had een
bombazijnen wambuis aan. Hij zag er flink uit in zijn zondagspak.
--Gaat gij toch mee? vroeg Nele hem.
--Ik ben dadelijk terug.
--Wil ik in uwe plaats gaan? sprak Nele.
--Neen, zegde hij, de wegen zijn vol modder.
--Waarom, vroeg de dame gestoord en insgelijks jaloersch, waarom,
kleine meid, wilt gij hem beletten van mede te gaan?
Nele antwoordde heur niet, maar twee dikke tranen welden in heure
oogen, en treuriglijk en gramstorig bekeek zij de schoone edel vrouwe.
Gevieren begaven zij zich op weg, de dame op hare witte hakkenei
met zwart fluweel getuigd; de bottelier met zijn waggelenden buik;
Uilenspiegel, die de hakkenij bij den breidel hield, en Bibulus
Snuffius, die, met den steert in de lucht, fier naast zijn meester
stapte.
Geruimen tijd reden en gingen zij aldus voort, maar Uilenspiegel was
niet op zijn gemak; stom als een visch snoof hij den fijnen benjoëreuk
op, die opsteeg uit de kleeren van de dame, en hij bekeek, ter sluip,
heur schoon paardentuig, heure zeldzame kleinooden en juweelen, en ook
heur zachtaardig uitzicht, heure schitterende oogen, heuren schoonen
boezem en heur haar, dat als een gouden helmet in de zonne schitterde.
--Waarom zegt gij zoo weinig, vriendje? vroeg zij.
Hij antwoordde niet.
--'t Ware jammer als gij uwe tong verloren hadt, want 'k had U geerne
met een boodschap belast.
--Welke? vroeg Uilenspiegel.
--Gij moet, sprak de dame, mij hier verlaten en naar Koolkerke gaan,
aan den anderen kant van den wind, en aldaar zeggen aan een edelman,
half in 't zwart, half in 't rood gekleed, dat hij mij vandaag niet
mag verwachten, maar Zondag komen moet, te tien uren van den nacht,
in mijn slot, langs de sluippoort.
--Ik ga niet! sprak Uilenspiegel.
--Waarom niet? vroeg de dame.
--Neen, ik ga niet! volhardde Uilenspiegel.
De dame sprak toen:
--Maar waarom toch maakt gij u driftig als een haantje, en wilt
niet gaan?
--Ik ga niet! sprak Uilenspiegel.
--Maar als ik U een gulden gaf?
--Neen! sprak hij.
--Een dukaat?
--Neen.
--Een karolus?
--Neen, sprak Uilenspiegel nog. En toch, voegde hij er bij met
een zucht, zou ik dien liever dan eene mosselschelp in moeder heur
tassche zien.
De dame glimlachte, en eensklaps riep zij uit:
--Ik ben mijne beugeltassche kwijt, een schoone zeldzame tassche van
zijdelaken, met fijne perelen geborduurd. Te Damme had ik ze nog aan
mijne ceintuur bevestigd.
Uilenspiegel verroerde zich niet, maar de bottelier ging naar de
edelvrouwe:
--Mevrouwe, sprak hij, als die jonge schavuit ze gaat zoeken, ziet
gij hem nimmer terug.
--En wie zal dan gaan? vroeg de edelvrouwe.
--Ik, sprak hij, hoewel ik oud van jaren ben.
En terstond ging hij op zoek.
Middag sloeg de klok; 't was drukkend warm en stille en eenzaam in
het ronde. Uilenspiegel sprak geen woord, doch deed zijn nieuw wambuis
uit, om de dame onder de schaduwe van een lindeboom te laten rusten,
zonder dat de koelte van het gras heur kwellen kon. En hij bleef
rechtstaan in verzuchting, naast heur.
Zij zag hem aan en voelde medelijden voor dien blooden jongen,
en vroeg hem of hij niet moede was, zoo lang op zijne jonge beenen
te staan. Hij antwoordde niet, doch liet zich naast heur vallen, en
zij trok hem tot zich, en zijn hoofd rustte op heuren blooten boezem,
en daar lag hij zoo goed, dat zij het als eene zonde beschouwd hadde,
hem te zeggen, dat hij elders een hoofdkussen zoeken moest,
De bottelier kwam intusschen terug, zeggende dat hij de beugeltassche
niet gevonden had.
--Ik heb ze wedergevonden, ik, antwoordde de dame, toen ik van mijn
peerd steeg; in 't vallen was zij aan den stijgbeugel vastgeraakt. En
nu, sprak zij tot Uilenspiegel, leid ons nu recht naar Dudzele en
zeg mij uw naam.
--Mijn patroon, antwoordde hij, is de heer Sint Thijlbert, naam,
die bediedt vlug te been, om te gaan waar het goed is; mijn naam is
Klaas en mijn toenaam Uilenspiegel. Als ge U zelf in mijn spiegel wilt
aanschouwen, zult gij overtuigd zijn, dat er, gansch Vlaanderenland
door, geen schitterender bloem van schoonheid bestaat dan Uwe geurige
bekoorlijkheid.
De dame bloosde van welbehagen en was geenszins verbolgen.
En gedurende die lange afwezigheid weenden Soetkin en Nele bitterlijk.
XXVII.
Toen Uilenspiegel van Dudzele terugkwam, zag hij Nele, aan den
inkoom van de stad, met den rug tegen een hek geleund, en een tros
blauwe druiven in de hand. Een voor een at zij de vruchten, die
haar verfrischten, maar blijken liet zij dit niet. Integendeel, zij
scheen verstoord, want driftig beet zij de druiven van de rist. Zij
was weemoedig, en had zulk een droevig en spijtig gezicht, dat
Uilenspiegel, vol liefde, medelijden kreeg en, stille achter haar,
heur eenen kus in den hals gaf.
Maar zij gaf hem een klinkenden kaakslag in de plaats.
--Die was raak, zei Uilenspiegel.
Zij weende dat de tranen over heure wangen rolden.
--Nele, sprak hij, gaat gij nu de fonteinen aan den ingang van de
stad stellen?
--Loop heen! zegde zij.
--Maar ik kan niet heengaan, als gij zoo weent, liefste?
--Ik ben geene liefste, sprak Nele, en weenen doe ik niet.
--Neen, gij weent niet, maar er komt water uit uwe oogen.
--Wilt gij gaan, sprak zij.
--Neen! zegde hij.
Maar met heure bevende handjes, hield zij heur schort voor 't gezicht;
zij beet er de stof van aan stukken, en heure tranen maakten het nat.
--Nele, vroeg Uilenspiegel, zeg eens, zal het straks schoon weder zijn?
En glimlachend zag hij heur liefderijk aan.
--Waarom vraagt ge mij dat? sprak zij.
--Omdat het spreekwoord zegt: na regen komt zonneschijn, antwoordde
Uilenspiegel.
--Ga, sprak zij, ga bij uw schoone dame met haar zijden kleed, die
hebt gij genoeg doen lachen.
Toen zong Uilenspiegel:
    Hoor ik mijn lieveken krijschen
    't Doet mijn herteken groot verdriet.
    Honig zoo gij haar lachen hoort,
    Peerlen zoo gij heur traantjes ziet....
    Ei, mijn lieveken laat ik niet!...
    En ik geef een bottel ten beste
    Lekkeren Leuvenschen wijn.
    En ik geef een bottel ten beste
    Als Nele vroo wil zijn....
--Gemeene man, sprak zij, gij lacht mij dan noch uit!
--Nele, sprak Uilenspiegel, ik ben een man, dat is waar, maar gemeen
ben ik niet, want onze adellijke familie, eene schepenfamilie, voert
drie zilveren pinten in een veld van bruinbier. Nele, is 't waar,
dat men, in Vlaanderenland, kaaksmeten maait als men kussen zaait?
--Ik spreek u niet aan, zegde zij.
--Waarom doet ge dan uw mondje open om het mij te zeggen?
--Ik ben kwaad, sprak zij.
Uilenspiegel klopte heel zachtjes op heuren rug en sprak:
--Kus een vrouwtje en ze zal u kloppen; klop een vrouwtje en ze zal
u kussen. Kus mij dan, liefste, vermits ik u klopte.
Nele keerde zich om. Hij opende zijne armen en, nog weenend, wierp
zij er zich in en vroeg:
--Zult ge ginder niet meer gaan, Thijl?
Maar hij antwoordde niet, want hij had het te druk met heure bevende
vingeren in de zijne te drukken en, met de lippen, de heete tranen
te wisschen, die uit Nele's oogen vielen als de dikke droppelen van
een stormregen.
XXVIII.
In dien tijd weigerde Gent, de edele stad, haar aandeel te betalen
in de bede, die haar zoon, keizer Karel, heur vroeg. Zij kon niet
betalen, want zij had geen geld meer, en dit was de schuld van Karel
zelf. Toch was dat een groote misdaad, en hij besloot haar in persoon
te gaan kastijden.
Want de slagen, die eene moeder het zeerst doen, zijn die van heuren
zoon.
Frans met den Langen Neus, zijn vijand, deed hem het aanbod om
door Frankrijk te gaan. Karel nam het aan, en in stee van te
worden gevangengezet, werd hij op vorstelijke wijze onthaald en
gevierd. Altijd zijn de vorsten bereid elkander te helpen, om 't volk
te onderdrukken.
Karel verbleef langen tijd te Valencijn, zonder eenig teeken van
toorn te geven. De stad Gent, zijne moeder, leefde zonder vrees in
het geloof, dat de Keizer, haar zoon, vergeten zou, wijl zij gehandeld
had volgens recht.
Karel kwam onder de muren van de stad met vier duizend peerden. Alva
was bij hem, alsmede de prins van Oranje. Het gemeen en de kleine
ambachten hadden geerne die kinderlijke intrede belet en de tachtig
duizend man van de stad en den bijvang op de been gebracht; maar de
hoogpoorters verzetten zich daartegen, want zij vreesden, dat het volk
de overhand zou krijgen. Nochtans had de stad Gent haren zoon met zijne
vier duizend peerden in de pan kunnen hakken. Maar zij beminde hem nog,
en de kleine ambachten zelven hadden weder vertrouwen gekregen.
Karel ook had haar lief, maar 't was om het geld, dat hij van haar
in zijne kisten had en nog van haar trekken wilde.
Toen hij zich meester gemaakt had van de stad, stelde hij overal
krijgswachten en liet hij dag- en nachtronden doen. Daarna sprak hij,
in groote statie, de sententie over de stede uit.
De voornaamste poorters moesten vóór zijnen troon vergiffenis komen
vragen, met een strop om den hals; Gent werd schuldig verklaard aan
de ergste misdaden, dewelke zijn: ontrouw, inbreuk op de tractaten,
ongehoorzaamheid, muiterij, opstand en majesteitsschennis. De keizer
verklaarde alle geschonken privileges, rechten, vrijheden, costumen
en gebruiken verbeurd en, de toekomst verbindende alsof hij God zelf
was, bepaalde hij verder, dat zijne opvolgers, bij hunne komst als
landheer, zweren moesten niets te zullen naleven dan de vernederende
Karolijnsche Concessie, door hem aan de stad verleend.
De abdij van Sint-Baafs deed hij afbreken, om ter plaatse eene vesting
te bouwen, van waar hij, gemakkelijk, de borst zijner moeder met
kogels kon doorboren.
Als een slechte zoon, die met ongeduld naar den dood zijner ouderen
wacht, verbeurde hij alle goederen en eigendommen van Gent, inkomsten
en panden, geschut en oorlogstuig.
En hij vond, dat de stad te goed verdedigd was: daarom deed hij den
Rooden Toren, den Paddenhoektoren, de Braampoort, de Steenpoort,
de Walpoort, de Ketelpoort en vele andere poorten afbreken, dewelke
als meesterstukken van bouwkunst en beeldhouwkunst doorgingen.
En als later vreemdelingen naar Gent kwamen, spraken zij verbaasd
tot elkaar:
--Is dàt Gent, die platte en treurige stad? Men vertelde er ons
wonderen van: men heeft ons bedrogen.
En die van Gent antwoordden:
--Keizer Karel heeft de stad heure krone ontnomen.
En dit zeggende, waren zij grammoedig en beschaamd. En uit het puin
van de poorten haalde de keizer steenen voor zijne vesting.
Hij wilde, dat Gent arm werd, daar aldus de stad noch door arbeid,
noch door handel of geld, zich tegen zijne stoutmoedige inzichten
verzetten kon; daarom veroordeelde hij haar tot het betalen van het
geweigerde aandeel in de schatting van vierhonderd duizend gouden
karolusgulden en, daarboven, honderd vijftig duizend karolussen in
eens, en elk jaar nog zes duizend als eeuwigdurende rente. Hij had
geld van de stad in leening gekregen en moest haar voor hetzelve
eene rente betalen van honderd vijftig pond grooten. Met geweld deed
hij zich de schuldbrieven overhandigen en verscheurde ze. En op die
manier betaalde hij zijne schuld.
In menige aangelegenheid had Gent hem lief gehad en geholpen. Maar
hij stak haar eenen dolk in de borst, om bloed te hebben, daar hij
geene melk meer vond.
Toen bezag hij Roeland, de schoone klokke, en aan haren klepel liet hij
den poorter opknoopen, die storm geluid had, om de stad ten strijde
te roepen, ten einde heur recht te verdedigen. Geene genade had hij
voor Roeland, de fiere klokke, de tong zijner moeder, waarmee zij
tot Vlaanderen sprak:
    Als men my slaat dan is 't brandt,
    Als men my luydt dan is 't storm in Vlaenderland.
Mits zijne moeder te luide sprak, nam hij de klokke weg. En die van
't platteland zeiden, dat Gent dood was, dat heur zoon, met eene tang,
heure tong uit heuren mond had gerukt.
XXIX.
Op een van die dagen,--heldere en frissche lentedagen, als heel de
aarde liefde ademt,--zat Soetkin bij het open venster te naaien,
neurde Klaas een deuntje, terwijl Uilenspiegel bezig was met Titus
Bibulus Snuffius eene rechterskap op te zetten. De hond ging met
zijne pooten te werk, alsof hij eene sententie moest uitspreken, maar
't was alleen om den hoed af te krijgen.
Doch eensklaps sprong Uilenspiegel naar het venster en deed het
dicht. Klaas en Soetkin keken op en zagen hun zoon rond de kamer
loopen, op tafels en stoelen springen om een vogeltje te vangen,
dat, met trillende vleugelen en piepend van angst, in den hoek van
een balk aan de zoldering eene schuilpaats ging zoeken.
Uilenspiegel wilde het diertje grijpen, toen Klaas hem met ruwe
stemme vroeg:
--Waarom springt gij aldus?
--Om het te vangen, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, het in eene kevie te
zetten, zaad te geven en voor mij te doen zingen.
Maar de vogel piepte van angst, vloog weer rond de kamer en bezeerde
zijn kopje tegen de ruiten.
Daar Uilenspiegel niet ophield met grijpen en springen, pakte Klaas
hem ruw bij den schouder.
--Vang het beestje, sprak hij, doe het voor u zingen, maar ik zal
u ook in eene kooi steken, met kloeke ijzeren staven gesloten en ik
zal ook u doen zingen. Gij, die zoo geerne loopt, wordt opgesloten;
in de schaduw gestoken als gij koude hebt, in den zonneschijn als
gij het warm hebt. En op een Zondag zullen wij uitgaan en vergeten u
eten te geven, en als wij 's Donderdags terugkomen, zullen wij Thijl,
gestorven van honger, met de beenen uitgestrekt vinden.
Soetkin weende, Uilenspiegel vloog naar het venster.
--Wat doet gij? vroeg Klaas.
--Het venster open doen om den vogel buiten te laten, antwoordde hij.
Inderdaad, de vogel, een distelvink, vloog het venster uit, tjilpte
blijde in de vrije lucht, en steeg als een pijl naar omhoog. Dan
ging hij op een perelaar zitten, waar hij zijne vleugelen streek en
zijne pluimen schudde en grammoedig, in zijne vogeltaal, Uilenspiegel
allerlei verwenschingen naar het hoofd stuurde.
Toen sprak Klaas:
--Mijn zoon, nooit moogt ge aan mensch of dier de vrijheid ontnemen,
want die is het hoogste goed. Laat een iegelijk de zonne zoeken als hij
koude heeft, en de schaduw als hij het warm heeft. En God oordeele
Zijne Heilige Majesteit, die het vrije geloof in Vlaanderenland
aan ketenen legt en Gent, de edele stad, in een ijzeren kooi van
slavernije sluit!
XXX.
Philippus was getrouwd met Maria van Portugal, wier bezittingen hij
bij de Spaansche krone gevoegd had; van haar had hij don Carlos,
den wreedaardigen zot. Maar liefde gevoelde hij voor zijne vrouw niet.
De koningin leed aan de gevolgen van heure kraam. Zij bleef te bed en
bij haar waren heure eeredames, onder dewelke de hertoginne van Alva.
Philippus liet heur dikwijls alleen, om ketters om hals te zien
brengen. De edelvrouwen en kamerheeren deden als hij. En zoo ook de
hertoginne van Alva, de adellijke baker van Maria.
In dien tijd vatte de officiaal een Vlaamschen beeldhouwer,
Roomsch-katholiek van geloove, omdat een monnik hem den overeengekomen
prijs voor een houten Lieve-Vrouwenbeeld geweigerd had, en nu het
aangezicht van het beeld met zijnen beitel had geschonden, zeggende:
dat hij liever zijn werk vernielde, dan het te laten onder den prijs.
Door den monnik als beeldschenner aangeklaagd, werd hij zonder genade
op de pijnbank gelegd, en veroordeeld om levend te worden verbrand.
Op de pijnbank had men hem de voetzolen geroosterd en onderwege,
van het gevang naar den brandstapel, met den san benito op het hoofd,
riep hij gedurig:
--Snijdt mijne voeten af! Snijdt mijne voeten af!
En van verre hoorde Philippus die bange kreten, en hij trilde van
genot, maar hij lachte niet.
De eeredames verlieten koningin Maria om de voltrekking van het vonnis
bij te wonen: na haar volgde de hertoginne van Alva, die bij het hooren
van de kreten van den Vlaamschen kunstenaar, ook het schouwspel wilde
zien en de Koningin alleen liet.
Toen Philippus, zijne hooge dienaren, prinsen, graven, schildknapen en
hofdames dáár waren, werd de beeldhouwer met een lange keten aan een
paal geklonken, te midden van een vuur, gemaakt van rijshout en stroo,
dat hem langzaam moest braden, terwijl hij zich zoo verre mogelijk
van het laaie vuur wilde houden.
Hij was zoo goed als naakt, en nieuwsgieriglijk keek men hoe hij
beproefde zijne zielskracht te stellen tegen de hitte des vuurs.
En middelerwijl had Maria dorst. Zij zag een halven meloen op eene
schaal liggen, sleepte zich uit heur bedde, greep de vrucht en verslond
die gulzig.
De verkoelende vrucht deed de kraamvrouw huiveren. Zij bleef op de
vloer liggen, ze kon zich niet bewegen.
--Ik zou mij verwarmen, was hier iemand om mij te bedde te leggen?
Toen hoorde zij den armen beeldhouwer schreeuwen:
--Snijdt mijne voeten af!
--Ach! riep de arme vorstinne, is dat een hond, die huilt om mijnen
dood te voorspellen?
Op dat oogenblik zag de beeldhouwer rondom zich; doch hij bespeurde
niets dan vijandige Spaansche gezichten, en hij dacht aan Vlaanderen,
het land van de dapperen; en, zijne lange keten achter zich sleepend,
stapte hij naar den vuurgloed van stroo en van rijshout. Zich in zijn
gansche lengte verheffend en de armen kruisend sprak hij:
--Ziet hoe de Vlamingen sterven onder het oog van de Spaansche
beulen! Snijdt niet mijne, maar hunne voeten af, opdat ze naar
geen nieuwe euveldaden loopen! Leve Vlaanderen! Vlaanderen in der
eeuwigheid!
En de edelvrouwen juichten hem toe, vroegen genade voor hem, als ze
zijne fiere houding zagen.
En de kunstenaar stierf.
Koningin Maria rilde over gansch heur lichaam, heure tanden klapperden
van koude en, armen en beenen uitrekkend, kreunde zij:
--Legt mij te bedde, dat ik mij verwarme. En zij stierf.
En alzoo, volgens de voorzegging van Katelijne, de goede tooveres,
zaaide Philippus overal dood, bloed en tranen.
XXXI.
Maar Uilenspiegel en Nele hadden elkander innig lief.
Het was op 't einde van de Grasmaand; al de boomen stonden in bloei,
de planten waren in lichtgroen gedost, de nachtegalen kwinkeleerden
in het loover: de heele natuur had zich gereedgemaakt om de Meimaand
waardig te ontvangen.
Dikwerf dwaalden Uilenspiegel en Nele getweeën langs de wegen. Nele
ging aan Uilenspiegel's arm en hield hem met hare twee handjes
vast. Uilenspiegel had dit geerne en sloeg soms zijn arm om Nele's
middel, om heur beter vast te houden, zegde hij. En dit deed heur
genoegen, doch zij uitte geen woord.
De wind voerde den balsemgeur der beemden over de wegen; in de verte
loeide traagzaam de zee. Uilenspiegel stapte fier vooruit; als een
jonge duivel, en Nele volgde schuchter als eene heilige uit den hemel,
beschaamd over 't genot dat zij smaakte.
Zij leunde heur hoofdje op den schouder van Uilenspiegel: hij nam
heure handjes in de zijne en kuste heur, al gaande, op het voorhoofd,
op de koonen en op heuren liefelijken mond. Doch zij uitte geen woord.
Het werd warm en zij kregen dorst; zij gingen melk drinken bij eenen
boer, maar zij waren niet verkoeld.
En zij zetten zich neer in het gras, aan den boord eener gracht. Nele's
gelaat was bleek en zij scheen bekommerd; angstig keek Uilenspiegel
heur aan.
--Zijt ge droef? sprak zij.
--Ja, antwoordde hij.
--Waarom? vroeg zij.
--Ik weet het niet, sprak hij, maar die bloesem van appelaars en
kriekelaars, die zoele lucht als bezwangerd met het vuur van den
bliksem, die blozende madeliefjes in de beemden, die witte hagedoorn,
hier dicht bij ons....
... Wie zal mij zeggen waarom ik heel ontroerd ben, waarom ik mij
steeds bereid voel tot sterven of slapen? En mijn hert klopt hevig als
ik de vogelen hoor zingen, als ik zie dat de zwaluwen terugkeeren; ik
zou willen vliegen, verder dan zon en mane. En nu eens heb ik koud,
dan weer heb ik warm. Ha, Nele! Ik zou niet meer van deze wereld
willen zijn, of duizend levens geven voor haar, die mij heure minne
schenken zou....
Maar zij uitte geen woord en, glimlachend van geluk, keek zij naar
Uilenspiegel.
XXXII.
Op Allerzielen kwam Uilenspiegel uit Onze Lieve Vrouwekerk met eenige
deugnieten van zijn leeftijd. Lamme Goedzak was onder hen verdwaald,
als een lam te midden van de wolven.
Lamme, die op alle Zon- en feestdagen van zijne moeder drie oortjes
kreeg, trakteerde de jonge snaken.
Hij trok dus met hen in het Roode Schild, bij Jan van Liebeke, die
Kortrijkschen dobbelen knollaard opbracht.
De drank verhitte hunne hersenen en, wijl zij over kerken en gebeden
spraken, uitte Uilenspiegel de meening, dat zielmissen enkel voordeel
brengen aan de priesters.
Maar er was een judas onder 't gezelschap: hij ging Uilenspiegel als
ketter verklikken. En ondanks de tranen van Soetkin en het smeeken van
Klaas, werd Uilenspiegel gepakt en gevangengezet. Eene maand en drie
dagen bleef hij in den kerker opgesloten, zonder iemand te zien. De
cipier at de drie kwart van zijn eten op. Intusschentijd deed men
onderzoek over het gedrag van den beklaagde. Er werd alleen bevonden,
dat hij een meedoogenlooze spotter was, die met iedereen gekscheerde,
maar dat hij nooit het minste kwaad gesproken had noch van den Heere
God, noch van de Maagd Maria, noch van de santen. Weshalve de sententie
dan ook zacht was; want men hadde hem kunnen brandmerken of geeselen
met schorpioenen.
Om den wille van zijn jeugdigen leeftijd, veroordeelden de rechters
hem enkel om, in zijn hemde, barrevoets en blootshoofds en met eene
waskeers in de hand, achter de priesters te stappen, in 't midden
van de eerste processie, die zou uitgaan.
Het was Ons-Heeren-Hemelvaart.
Als de processie binnentrok, moest hij in 't portaal van
Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk blijven staan en uitroepen:
--Dank zij Jezus-Christus! Dank zij de eerweerde geestelijken! Hunne
gebeden zijn zoet en verkwikkend voor de zielen in 't vagevuur; want
elk ave is een emmer water, die haar op den rug valt, en elk pater
eene kuip.
En het volk aanhoorde hem devotelijk, doch niet zonder lachen.
Op den Eersten-Sinksendag, moest hij nogmaals de processie volgen; hij
was barrevoets en blootshoofds, in zijn hemde, met eene waskeers in de
hand. Bij het binnengaan in 't portaal, met zijne keers eerbiediglijk
in de hand, hoewel hij moeite deed om niet in lachen uit te bersten,
sprak hij met een luide en heldere stem:
--Zoo de gebeden der christenen veel verlichting brengen
aan de zielen van 't vagevuur, zoo geven die van den deken van
Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk--een heilig man die alle deugden beoefent--zulk
eene verkwikking aan de smerten des vuurs, dat dit laatste seffens in
ijs verandert. Maar de duivelen, die het vuur moeten poken, krijgen
er geen zier van.
En weer luisterde het volk devotelijk, doch niet zonder lachen,
en de deken glimlachte inwendiglijk.
Verder werd Uilenspiegel voor drie jaren uit Vlaanderenland gebannen;
hem werd tevens opgelegd eene bedevaart naar Rome te doen en terug
te komen met de Pauselijke absolutie.
Klaas moest drie gulden voor deze sententie betalen, maar hij gaf er
nog eenen aan zijn zoon en daarboven eene pelgrimspij.
Op den dag van 't vertrek was Uilenspiegel 't hert in, toen hij
Klaas en Soetkin kuste, want ze schreide bitter, de arme moeder. Zij
deden hem uitgeleide tot verre op den weg, in gezelschap van meerdere
poorters en poorteressen.
Toen Klaas terug in de hut trad, sprak hij tot Soetkin:
--Vrouwe, 't is toch wreed een zoo jongen knaap tot zulke strenge
straf te veroordeelen, en dit voor eenige lichtzinnige woorden.
--Gij weent, man, sprak Soetkin; gij bemint hem meer dan ge wilt laten
blijken, want daar berst gij uit in mannelijke snikken, die de tranen
van den leeuw zijn.
Maar hij antwoordde niet.
Nele was zich in de schuur gaan verbergen, opdat niemand zien zou,
dat ook zij weende om Uilenspiegel. Van verre volgde zij Soetkin en
Klaas, de poorters en poorteressen; en toen zij heuren vriend alleen
zag voortgaan, liep ze naar hem en sprong hem om den hals:
--Ginder zult gij schoone vrouwen vinden, sprak zij.
--Schoon, misschien, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, maar toch zoo frisch
niet als gij, want zij zijn allen verbrand van de zonne.
Lang nog stapten zij samen voort: Uilenspiegel was nadenkend en
prevelde van tijd tot tijd:
--Die zielmissen zullen ze mij betalen.
--Welke missen en wie zal betalen? vroeg Nele.
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Alle dekenen, parochiepapen, geestelijken, kosters en andere
hooge en lage zotskappen, die ons allerhande domheden willen doen
slikken. Was ik een noeste arbeider geweest, dan was ik voor drie jaar
mijn dagloon bestolen, met hunne bedevaart. Maar 't is de arme Klaas,
die betaalt. Mijne drie jaar zal ik hun honderdvoudig betaald zetten;
ik zal hun eene zielmis zingen, die hun aan de ribben zal hangen.
--Laas! Thijl, wees toch voorzichtig, zij zouden u levend verbranden,
antwoordde Nele.
Ik ben vuurvast, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
En zij namen afscheid van elkander: zij badend in tranen, hij
droefgeestig en gram.
XXXIII.
Toen Uilenspiegel door Brugge, over de Woensdagmarkt kwam, zag hij
daar eene vrouw, die rondgeleid werd door den beul en zijne knechten,
en een groote menigte andere vrouwen, die rondom haar tierden en heur
allerhande vuile beleedigingen toewierpen.
Daar zij boven aan heur kleed roode lapjes en den steen der justitie
met zijne ijzeren ketenen om den hals droeg, begreep Uilenspiegel,
dat het eene vrouw was, die het jeugdig en maagdelijk lichaam van hare
dochteren verkocht had. Men zei hem, dat zij Barbara hiet en getrouwd
was met Jason Darue; dat ze in dit gewaad van de eene plaats naar
de andere gesleurd werd, totdat zij terugkwam op de Groote Markt,
waar het schavot voor haar gereed stond. Uilenspiegel volgde haar
met de menigte, die achter heur huilde en tierde. Op de Groote Markt
teruggekomen, werd zij op het schavot gebracht, aan eenen paal
gebonden, en de beul legde voor hare voeten een hoop gras en een
klomp aarde: de bediedenis van het graf.
Ook zei men aan Uilenspiegel, dat ze vooraf in 't gevang gegeeseld was.
Voortgaande, ontmoette hij Hendrik Marischal, schooier, die in de
kasselrij West-Ieperen gehangen was geweest; rond den hals toonde
hij nog het merk van de koorden. Hij hing al in de lucht, zegde hij,
en was verlost geworden alleenlijk door een goed gebed te doen tot
Onze-Lieve-Vrouwe van Halle, zoodanig, dat, toen de baljuws en de
rechters vertrokken waren, door een echt mirakel de koorden braken
en hij ongedeerd ten gronde viel.
Maar later hoorde Uilenspiegel zeggen, dat die van de koorden verloste
bedelaar een valsche Hendrik Marischal was, en dat men hem zijne
leugen liet rondventen, omdat hij een perkament had, afgegeven door
den deken van Onze-Lieve-Vrouwe van Halle, die, door het vertelsel
van dien Hendrik Marischal, de galgenazen in grooten getale met rijke
offeranden naar zijne kerk lokte. En Onze-Lieve-Vrouwe van Halle werd,
zeer lang nog, Onze-Lieve-Vrouwe der Gehangenen genoemd.
XXXIV.
In dien tijd moesten kettermeesters en godgeleerden keizer Karel
voor de tweede reis vermanen: dat de Kerke ten onder ging; dat haar
gezag miskend werd; dat zoo hij menigvuldige zegepralen behaald had,
hij dit verschuldigd was aan de gebeden der Katholieke Kerk, die de
keizerlijke macht op haren troon in stand hield.
Een aartsbisschop van Spanje vroeg hem om zes duizend hoofden te
laten afkappen en evenveel lichamen te laten verbranden, ten einde
de kwaadaardige Luthersche ketterije in de Nederlanden uit te
roeien. Zijne Heilige Majesteit oordeelde, dat dit niet voldoende was.
Overal waar de ontzette Uilenspiegel dan ook voorbij kwam, zag hij
niets dan hoofden op palen, meisjes in zakken genaaid en levend in 't
water gesmeten, mannen naakt op het rad gebonden en met ijzeren staven
geslagen, vrouwen levend in eenen kuil gelegd, met aarde boven haar
en den beul op haren boezem dansen om dien te verpletteren. Maar de
biechtvaders van hen die zich vooraf bekeerd hadden, kregen telkenmale
twaalf stuivers voor hunne moeite.
Te Leuven zag hij de beulen dertig Lutheranen tegelijk verbranden
en den brandstapel met schietpoeder aansteken. Te Limburg zag hij
een gansche familie, mannen en vrouwen, dochteren en zonen, ter
strafplaatse leiden. Allen zongen psalmen. Alleen de oude vader
schreeuwde, terwijl hij verbrandde.
En Uilenspiegel ging zijns weegs, met beklemd en toegenepen herte.
XXXV.
In het open veld gekomen schudde hij zich als een vogeltje, als een
hond die den band ontloopen is, en zijn herte was verkwikt bij het
aanschouwen van de boomen, van de beemden, van de heldere zonne.
Als hij drie dagen lang gegaan had, kwam hij omtrent Brussel, in de
machtige gemeente Ukkel. Vóór het gasthof de Trompet, werd zijn neus
gestreeld door een hemelschen geur van stoverije. Aan een kleinen
schooier, die den reuk van de saus opsnoof, vroeg hij ter eere van
welken heilige die wierook omhoog steeg? De kleine antwoordde, dat
de broeders van de Goede Tronie na de vespers moesten bijeenkomen
om de herinnering te vieren van de verlossing der gemeente door hare
vrouwen en meisjes.
Uilenspiegel zag van verre eenen staak met een gaai erop, rond
denwelken vrouwen met bogen liepen; hij vroeg of de vrouwlieden nu
boogschieters waren geworden?
De jongen snoof nog eens den reuk van de keuken op en antwoordde, dat,
in den tijd van den goeden hertog, die zelfde bogen, in de handen der
Ukkelsche vrouwen, meer dan honderd baanstroopers van het leven naar
den dood hadden gestuurd.
Uilenspiegel wilde meer weten, doch de kleine schooier zei dat hij
geen woord meer zeggen zou, zoolang hij honger en dorst had, ten ware
hij een oortje kreeg om zich te verzadigen. Uilenspiegel gaf het hem
uit medelijden.
Zoodra de jongen het oortje had, trok hij, als een vos in een
hoenderhok, het gasthof binnen, om weldra, met een halve worst en
eene dikke snee brood triomfantelijk te voorschijn te komen.
Plotseling hoorde Uilenspiegel een zoete muziek van tamboerijnen en
violen en zag hij vele dansende vrouwen, en onder haar een schoon
wijf met een gouden ketting om den hals.
De schooier, in zijn schik, omdat hij zoo lekker gegeten had, zegde
tot Uilenspiegel dat die jonge, schoone vrouw de koningin van de
gaaischieting was, dat zij Mietje heette en de vrouw was van messire
Renonckel, schepene van de gemeente. Dan vroeg hij aan Uilenspiegel
nog zes duiten om te drinken: Uilenspiegel gaf ze hem. Toen hij
gegeten en gedronken had, zette hij zich in de zonne op de hurken,
en kuischte met zijne nagelen zijne tanden.
Als de boogschietsters Uilenspiegel in zijne pelgrimspij zagen,
begonnen zij rond hem te dansen, zeggende:
--Dag, schoone pelgrim; komt gij van verre, jonge pelgrim?
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Ik kom uit Vlaanderen, het schoone land der verliefde meidekens.
En droefgeestig dacht hij aan Nele.
--Wat was uwe misdaad? vroegen zij, terwijl zij haren dans staakten.
--Ik durf het niet zeggen, daar ze zoo groot is, sprak hij. Bij mij,
mijne hertjes, is niemendal klein.
Zij lachten en vroegen waarom hij aldus moest reizen met den
pelgrimsstaf, den bedelzak en de oesterschelpen?
--'t Is, antwoordde hij, omdat ik gezegd heb, dat de zielmissen
voordeelig zijn voor de priesters.
--Zij brengen hun klinkende munt op, antwoordden de vrouwen, maar
toch zijn zij ook voordeelig voor de zielen in 't vagevuur.
--Daar was ik niet bij, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Komt gij met ons eten? vroeg de schoonste.
--Ik wil, sprak hij, met u eten, en u eten, u en uwe vriendinnen,
de eene na de andere, want gij zijt fijne brokjes, lekkerder dan
ortolanen, lijsters of sneppen.
--De Hemel vergeve u, dat wild is buiten prijs, zeiden zij.
--Zooals gij allen, mijne hertjes, antwoordde hij.
--'t Is te zien, spraken zij, maar wij zijn niet te koop.
--Noch te geven? vroeg hij.
--Ja, zegden zij, wij geven slagen aan degenen die te stout zijn. Hebt
gij er van doen, wij zullen op u slaan lijk op kaf.
--Ik doe niet mee, sprak hij.
--Kom dan mee-eten, zegden zij.
Blijde als hij was rond zich vroolijke, lachende gezichten te zien,
volgde hij heur naar de binnenplaats van het gasthof. Plotseling
zag hij de broeders van de Goede Tronie, in groote staatsie, met
vaandel, fluit, bazuin en tamboerijn, in het binnenhof komen; zij
droegen waardiglijk den naam van hunne broederschap. Daar zij hem
nieuwsgieriglijk bekeken, zeiden de vrouwen dat het een pelgrim was,
dien ze op den weg ontmoet en meegebracht hadden naar 't festijn,
omdat zijne tronie haar aanstond.
De mannen stemden hiermee in, en een hunner sprak:
--Reizende pelgrim, wilt gij eene bedevaart doen in sausen en
stoverije?
--Daarvoor wil ik de leerzen van Duimken aantrekken, antwoordde
Uilenspiegel.
Als hij met hen de zaal van 't festijn binnenging, zag hij op den
Parijschen steenweg een twaalftal blinden. En toen zij voorbij hem
kwamen, kloegen zij van honger en dorst. Uilenspiegel zei tot zich
zelven, dat zij dien dag zouden avondmalen als prinsen, en wel ten
koste van den deken van Ukkel, op afkorting van de zielmissen.
Hij ging tot hen en sprak:
--Hier zijn negen gulden, gij kunt komen eten. Riekt gij den geur
niet van de stoverije?
--Laas! spraken zij, reeds een half uur lang, doch zonder hope.
--Gij zult eten, zegde Uilenspiegel, vermits gij nu negen gulden
hebt. Maar hij gaf ze hun niet.
--Wees gezegend! spraken zij.
En, door Uilenspiegel geleid, zetten zij zich rond een kleine tafel,
terwijl de broeders van de Goede Tronie met hunne wijven en dochteren
aan de groote tafel gingen zitten.
Met een zelfvertrouwen van negen gulden, riepen de blinden luide
en stout:
--Baas, geef ons te eten en te drinken, alles van 't beste!
De weerd, die van negen gulden had hooren spreken, dacht, dat die in
hunne tasschen staken en vroeg wat de gasten wenschten.
Toen riepen allen tegelijk:
--Boonen met spek, hutspot met rundvleesch, kiekens, kalfsvleesch en
hamelbout. Zijn de worsten voor de honden gemaakt?
--'k Heb witte en zwarte pensen geroken; 'k zou ze zien als ik nog
mijne lanteernen had.--Waar zijn de koekebakken met Anderlechtsche
boter? Zij zingen in de pan, sappig, knappend en hijgend naar het bier,
waarmede wij ze zullen begieten.--Wie geeft de hesp met eieren die
onzen mond placht te streelen?--Waar zijt gij, hemelsche soezels, die
zwemmen midden in de nieren, hanekammen, kalfszwezeriken, ossesteerten,
schapepooten, met veel ajuin, peper, kruidnagelen, muskaat, goed
ondereengestoofd met drie pinten witten wijn als saus?--Wie brengt
u tot mij, goddelijke kalfsworsten, die zoo goed zijt dat ge niets
zegt als men u opeet? Kwaamt gij recht uit Luilekkerland, waar niet
te werken valt, en eten en drinken een ambacht is? Gij zijt verdwenen
lijk de droge bladeren van den jongsten herfst.--Ik wil een hamelbout
met erwtjes.--Ik, verkensooren.--Ik, een rozenkrans van ortolanen,
met sneppen als paters en een vetten kapoen als credo.
De weerd antwoordde bedaard:
--Gij krijgt een pannekoek van zestig eieren en, als wegwijzers om
uwe vorken te bestieren, vijftig zwarte pensen, rookend op dien berg
van eieren gestoken, en als drank dobbelen peeterman: dat zal de
riviere wezen.
Het water kwam in den mond van de arme blinden.
Breng ons den berg, de wegwijzers en de rivier!
En de broeders van de Goede Tronie en hunne vrouwen, die reeds
met Uilenspiegel aan tafel zaten, zeiden, dat deze voor de blinden
onzichtbare smulpartij hun slechts de helft van het genot deed smaken.
Toen de weerd en vier koks den pannekoek opdienden, opgesmukt met
peterselie en keur van kruiden, wilden de blinden er zich op werpen,
maar de weerd gaf, niet zonder moeite, eerlijk aan elk zijn deel.
De boogschietsters waren verrukt als zij hen zagen slempen en zuchten
van genoegen, want zij hadden grooten honger en sloegen de pensen
binnen lijk oesters. De dobbele peeterman liep in hunne magen gelijk
een waterval van het hooggebergte.
Toen de blinden hunne teilen uitgewischt hadden, vroegen zij opnieuw
koekebakken, ortolanen en weer stoverije. De weerd bracht hun slechts
een grooten schotel ossen-, kalfs- en schapenbeenderen, die in goede
saus zwommen. Maar hij deelde niet rond.
Als zij hun brood en hunne handen, tot over de polsen, in de saus
gedoopt hadden, en niets vonden dan hamel-, kalfs- en andere beenderen,
meende een iegelijk dat zijn buurman al het vleesch had, en verwoed
sloegen zij met de beenderen op elkanders gezicht.
Bij dat schouwspel lachten de broeders van de Goede Tronie naar
hertelust en legden goedhertig een deel van 't festijn op de teil van
de arme blinden, en een iegelijk die een been zocht om er mee te slaan,
legde de hand op eene lijster, een kieken, een koppel leeuwerikken,
terwijl de vrouwen hun het hoofd achterover hielden en hun Brusselschen
wijn lieten drinken, zooveel zij konden. En als de arme lieden op den
tast zochten van waar die stroom godendrank kwam, grepen zij een rok,
die gezwind uit hunne handen glipte.
Zij lachten, aten, dronken en zongen zoo heerlijk! Eenigen vermoedden
dat er poezele wijfjes moesten zijn en liepen, dol van liefde,
de eetzale rond, maar de plaagzieke vrouwen draaiden zich om en
verborgen zich achter een broeder van de Goede Tronie, roepende:
"Kus mij, toe!" En als de blinden het deden, kusten zij in stee van
de donzige huid eener vrouw, het harig gezicht van een man--maar niet
zonder kletsen te krijgen.
De broeders van de Goede Tronie zongen, en zij zongen insgelijks. En
de vrouwen glimlachten teeder, met stil genoegen, als zij hen zoo
vol vroolijkheid zagen.
Toen die heerlijke uren voorbij waren, sprak de baas:
--Gij hebt goed gegeten en gedronken, geef mij nu zeven gulden.
Elk hunner zwoer dat hij de beurze niet had en beschuldigde zijn
buurman. Een nieuw gevecht ontstond, in hetwelk zij elkaar trachtten
te schoppen, te slaan en te stompen, maar de broeders van de Goede
Tronie hielden de vechtenden van elkaar. En 't regende slagen in de
lucht, behalve een die bij ongeluk terecht kwam op 't aangezicht van
den baas, die, verwoed, nu allen aftastte en niets anders vond dan een
versleten schapulier, zeven duiten, drie knoopen en hunne paternosters.
Hij wilde hen in het verkenskot steken en hen daar op water en brood
zetten, totdat liefdadige zielen voor hen betaald hadden.
--Wilt gij, vroeg Uilenspiegel, dat ik borg voor hen blijve?
--Ja, antwoordde de baas, als iemand ook voor u borg is.
De Goede Tronies wilden borg zijn, maar Uilenspiegel voorkwam hen
en zei:
--De deken zal borg zijn, ik ga het hem vragen.
Gedachtig aan de zielmissen, trok hij naar den deken en vertelde hem
dat de baas uit de Trompet van den duivel bezeten was, en dat hij
van anders niets sprak dan van verkens en blinden; dat de verkens de
blinden opaten en de blinden de verkens. Middelerwijl, zoo vertelde
hij, brak de baas thuis alles aan stukken, en hij bad hem den armen
man van dien boozen duivel te komen verlossen.
De deken beloofde het, maar zei, dat hij niet dadelijk kon komen,
mits hij bezig was met de rekening van 't kapittel te maken en dat
dit zeer lastig was, zoo hij zijn garande wilde hebben.
Toen Uilenspiegel zag dat hij ongeduldig werd, zegde hij dat hij
zou terugkomen met het wijf van den baas en dat de deken haar zelve
kon spreken.
--'t Is goed, antwoordde de deken.
Uilenspiegel keerde terug bij den baas en zegde:
--Ik heb den deken gesproken, hij blijft borg voor de blinden. Terwijl
gij op hen let, kan de bazinne meekomen, en hij zal heur herhalen
wat ik u zegde.
--Ga mee, vrouw, sprak de baas.
De bazinne ging met Uilenspiegel bij den deken, die maar altijd aan
't cijferen was, om zijn aandeel te vinden. Toen zij binnenkwam met
Uilenspiegel, maakte hij met de hand een driftig gebaar, zeggende:
--Ga heen en wees gerust: morgen of overmorgen kom ik bij uwen man.
En toen Uilenspiegel naar de Trompet terugkeerde, sprak hij onderweg
in zich zelven: "Hij zal honderd gulden betalen en dat zal mijn eerste
zielmisse zijn."
En hij ging zijns weegs, en de blinden insgelijks.
XXXVI.
's Anderen daags kwam Uilenspiegel op eene baan vol volk. Hij volgde
de menigte en vernam, dat het dien dag beeweg naar Alsemberg was.
Hij zag er arme oude vrouwen, die, voor een gulden en om de zonden van
voorname dames te boeten, barrevoets achterweerts gingen. Terzijde
van den weg deed meer dan één pelgrim zich te goed aan wafelen en
bruinbier, bij geschal van lieren, violen en doedelzakken. En de reuk
van allerhande spijzen steeg ten hemel als een zoete wierook.
Maar daar waren ook pelgrims, die er gemeen en ellendig uitzagen;
die hadden zes stuivers van de Kerk gekregen, om achterweerts den
beeweg te doen.
Een kaalhoofdig manneken, met opengesperde oogen, volgde hen insgelijks
achterweerts springend en vaderonzen zeggend.
Uilenspiegel, die wilde weten waarom hij aldus de kreeften naäapte,
ging voor hem staan en sprong glimlachend lijk hij. Lieren, pijpen,
violen en doedelzakken, waren met het geschreeuw van de pelgrims,
de muziek van dien dans.
--Zeg eens, Jan van den Duivel, sprak Uilenspiegel, is het om zeker
te zijn van vallen, dat gij averechts gaat?
De man antwoordde niet en bad voort.
--Of is het om de boomen te tellen, vervolgde Uilenspiegel, en
misschien ook de bladeren er bij?
De man, die een credo zei, deed Uilenspiegel teeken dat hij zwijgen
moest.
--Of, sprak deze, altijd vóór hem springend en zijne gebaren
nabootsend, zijt gij misschien eensklaps zot geworden, dat gij
loopt lijk de kreeften? Maar wie van een zot een verstandig antwoord
verwacht, is zelf niet wijs. Niet waar, mijnheer de kaalkop?
Daar de man nog niet antwoordde, danste en sprong Uilenspiegel voort,
doch hij maakte daarbij zooveel lawijd met zijne zolen, dat de weg
klonk als een houten kist.
--Of zijt gij stom, mijnheer? vroeg Uilenspiegel ten slotte.
--Ave Maria, sprak de man, gratia plena et benedictus fructus ventris
tui, Jesu.
--Of misschien doof? zei Uilenspiegel. Dat gaan wij dadelijk zien:
men zegt, dat dooven vleierij noch beleediging hooren. Laat zien of
de trommel van uw ooren van vel of van ijzer is: Meent gij, lanteerne
zonder keers, mislukte voetganger, dat gij een mensch gelijkt? Ge
kunt wachten totdat wij van vodden gemaakt zijn. Zag men ooit zulke
gele tronie, zulk een kletshoofd, elders dan op een galgeveld? Zijt
ge in uw leven nooit gehangen geweest?
En Uilenspiegel danste steeds voort, en de man, die kwaad werd,
stapte boosaardig achterwaarts en bad zijn vaderonzen met heimelijke
verbolgenheid.
--Of misschien, sprak Uilenspiegel, verstaat gij geen Hoogvlaamsch;
daarom ga ik u in 't Platvlaamsch aanspreken: Zijt gij geen gulzigaard,
dan zijt gij een dronkaard; zijt gij geen dronkaard, dan zijt gij
verstopt; zijt gij niet verstopt, dan hebt gij den afgang; als er
matigheid is, dan is zij het niet, die de tonnen van uw buik vult;
zijt gij geen losbol, dan zijt gij een kapuin en als er op de duizend
millioen mannen der aarde maar één horendrager was, dan zoudt gij
het zijn....
Op die rede, viel Uilenspiegel op zijn achterste, met de beenen omhoog,
want de man had hem zulk een vuistslag op den neus toegediend, dat
het vuur hem uit zijne oogen sprong. Dan liet de man zich, ondanks
zijn dikken buik, verraderlijk op hem vallen en sloeg hem overal,
dat de slagen als hagelsteenen op het magere lichaam van Uilenspiegel
vielen. En Uilenspiegels stok rolde mede ten gronde.
--Dat zal u leeren, sprak de man, eerlijke menschen kwellen die
op bedevaart gaan. Want--gij moogt het wel weten--ik ook ga naar
Alsemberg, volgens aloud gebruik, om Onze-Lieve-Vrouwe te bidden,
een kind te willen doen afkomen, dat mijne vrouw ontving terwijl
ik op reis was. Om zulk een groote genade te verkrijgen, moet men,
zonder spreken, achterweerts loopen en dansen van den twintigsten
stap voorbij zijn huis tot aan de trappen der kerk. Laas! nu moet ik
geheel opnieuw beginnen.
Uilenspiegel, die zijn stok opgeraapt had, sprak:
--Ik zal u helpen, deugniet, die Onze-Lieve-Vrouwe wilt smeeken om
de kinderen vóór hun geboorte te vermoorden.
En meteen sloeg hij den leelijken horendrager zoo deerlijk, dat hij
hem voor dood op den weg liet.
En nog altijd steeg het gehuil der pelgrims en het geluid van  pijpen,
lieren, violen en doedelzakken omhoog, met den geurigen wierook van
gekook en gebraad.
XXXVII.
Klaas, Soetkin en Nele zaten samen rond den heerd en praatten over
den reizenden pelgrim.
--Meisje, sprak Soetkin, kondet gij hem voor altijd bij ons houden
door uwe jeugd en uwe schoonheid!
--Laas! sprak Nele, ik kan niet.
--Omdat hij, antwoordde Klaas, meer behagen vindt in loopen, zonder
ooit te rusten, tenzij om te eten.
--De leelijke stouterik! zuchtte Nele.
--Ik geef toe dat hij stout is, sprak Soetkin, maar leelijk is
hij niet. Als Uilenspiegel Grieksch noch Romeinsch van gezicht is,
is hij des te schooner; want Vlaamsch zijn zijne vlugge voeten, van
't Brugsche Vrije zijn levendige bruine oogen; en zijn neus en mond
zijn gemaakt door twee vossen, ervaren in de kunsten van slimheid
en verstand.
--Wie dan, vroeg Klaas, maakte hem zijne armen van luierik en zijne
beenen, die al te vlug loopen naar vermaak en pleizier?
--Zijn al te jeugdig herte, was 't antwoord van Soetkin.
XXXVIII.
In dien tijd genas Katelijne, met kruiden, een os, drie schapen en een
verken toebehoorende aan Speelman, doch de koe van Jan Beloen kon ze
niet genezen. Jan beschuldigde haar van hekserij en verklaarde, dat
zij het dier betooverd had, daar zij, terwijl zij het de geneeskruiden
gaf, het gestreeld en aangesproken had, zeker in een duivelsche tale,
want een eerlijk christenmensch mag het woord tot geen dier richten.
Gemelde Jan Beloen voegde er bij, dat hij gebuur was van Speelman,
wiens os, schapen en verken zij genezen had en, zoo zij zijne
koe gedood had, het zeker was op het opstoken van Speelman, die
jaloersch was, omdat zijne akkers slechter bebouwd waren en minder
opbrachten dan de zijne--van Beloen namelijk. Op getuigenis van Pieter
Meulemeester, een man van goed gedrag en zeden, en ook van Jan Beloen,
die bevestigden dat Katelijne te Damme bekend stond als tooveres,
en naar allen schijn de koe gedood had, werd Katelijne aangehouden
en veroordeeld om op de pijnbank te worden gelegd totdat zij hare
misdaden bekende.
Zij werd ondervraagd door een schout, die altijd narrig was, want
heel den dag door dronk hij brandewijn. Vóór hem en vóór die van de
Vierschaar, deed hij Katelijne op de eerste pijnbank zetten.
De beul ontkleedde haar en keek of zij geenerlei hekserij verborgen
hield.
Hij vond niets, en bond heur met koorden op de pijnbank. Toen
zegde zij:
--Heilige Moeder Gods, laat mij sterven, dat ik mijne schamelheid
aan die mannen niet hoeve te toonen!
Toen legde de beul natte doeken op heure borst, heuren buik en heure
armen; vervolgens hief hij de bank op en goot hij heet water in
heure keel, bij zulke groote hoeveelheid, dat zij gansch opgeblazen
scheen. Vervolgens liet hij de bank nedervallen.
De schout vroeg aan Katelijne of zij hare misdaad wilde bekennen. Zij
schudde het hoofd. Toen goot de beul nog heet water in haren mond,
maar Katelijne gaf het allemaal over.
Op het oordeel van den heelmeester, werd zij toen losgemaakt. Zij
sprak niet, doch klopte op hare borst om te zeggen, dat het heet
water haar verbrand had. Toen de schout zag dat zij van haar eerste
foltering bekomen was, sprak hij:
--Beken, dat gij tooveres zijt en dat gij de koe betooverd hebt.
--Ik zal niet bekennen, sprak zij. Zooveel het in de macht van mijn
zwak herte ligt, zie ik alle beesten geerne, en ik deed nog liever leed
aan mij zelve dan aan hen, daar zij zich niet verdedigen kunnen. Om
de koe te helpen, heb ik de geneeskruiden gebruikt, die ik moest.
Maar de schout sprak:
--Gij hebt vergif gebruikt, want de koe is gestorven.
--Heere schout, antwoordde Katelijne, ik ben hier voor u en in uwe
macht; en toch durf ik zeggen, dat een dier, evenals een mensch,
van ziekte kan sterven, niettegenstaande de hulp van artsen en
heelmeesteren. En bij Jezus-Christus, die voor onze zonden op het
kruis is gestorven, zweer ik dat ik die koe geenerlei kwaad gewild heb,
doch getracht heb ze te genezen met de gebruikelijke kruiden.
Woedend sprak toen de schout:
--Die tooverkol zal niet blijven afstrijden; men brenge heur op een
andere pijnbank!
En daarna dronk hij een groot glas brandewijn.
De beul deed Katelijne zitten op het deksel eener eiken doodkist,
die op pikkels stond. Dat deksel, in den vorm van een dak, was scherp
als een mes. Een groot vuur brandde in den schoorsteen, want men was
toen in de slachtmaand.
Katelijne werd op de doodkist en op een scherpe houten pinne gezet,
en men deed haar nieuwlederen schoenen aan die te smal waren. Zóó
schoof men heur tegen het vuur. Als zij de snede van de doodkist
en de scherpe pinne in heur vleesch voelde dringen, en de hitte van
't vuur het leder van de schoenen deed krimpen, riep zij uit:
--Ik lijd ongemeene smerten! Wie geeft mij zwart vergif?
--Breng haar dichter bij 't vuur, sprak de schout.
Toen ondervroeg hij Katelijne.
--Hoe dikwijls, sprak hij, reedt gij op een bezemsteel naar den
heksensabbat? Hoe dikwijls deedt gij het koren in de aar, de vrucht
op den boom, het kind in den schoot vergaan? Hoe dikwijls zaaidet
gij haat en nijd in de herten van broeders en zusters?
Katelijne wilde spreken, maar zij kon niet, en zij zwaaide met hare
handen als om "neen" te bedieden. Toen zegde de schout:
--Zij zal niet spreken vooraleer zij al heur heksenvet zal voelen
smelten. Breng haar nog dichter bij het vuur.
Katelijne schreeuwde. De schout zegde heur:
--Bid Satan dat hij u verfrissching bezorge.
Met het gezicht vol smerte, wees zij naar heure schoenen, die rookten
ten gevolge van de hitte des vuurs.
--Bid Satan, dat hij ze uitdoe, sprak de schout.
Tien uren sloeg de klok, dit was het etensuur van den wreedaard;
hij vertrok met zijn schrijver, den beul en zijn knechten, en liet
Katelijne alleen bij 't vuur, in de folterkamer.
Te elf uren kwamen zij terug, en zij vonden Katelijne stijf en
onbeweeglijk zitten. De schrijver sprak:
--Ik geloof, dat zij dood is.
De schout beval Katelijne van de doodkist te nemen en heure schoenen
uit te doen. De beul moest ze vaneen snijden en Katelijne's voeten
waren rood en bloedden.
En de schout, die aan zijn maaltijd dacht, bezag ze, doch uitte geen
woord; doch weldra kwam ze tot heur zelve terug; zij viel ten gronde
zonder zich te kunnen oprichten ondanks al heure krachtsinspanning,
en sprak tot den schout:
--Vroeger wildet gij mij voor echtgenoote, maar nu zult gij mij niet
meer hebben. Viermaal drie is een heilig getal, en de dertiende is
de echtgenoot.
Vervolgens, daar de schout wilde spreken, zegde zij tot hem:
--Zwijg stille: hij hoort beter dan de aartsengel, die in den hemel
de hertkloppingen der rechtvaardigen telt. Waarom komt gij zoo
spa? Viermaal drie is een heilig getal; het doodt de ellendelingen,
die mij willen vervolgen.
De schout sprak:
--Zij ontvangt den duivel in heur bedde.
--Zij is uitzinnig, ten gevolge van de smerten der foltering, sprak
de schrijver.
Katelijne werd terug naar 't gevang gebracht. Drie dagen nadien kwamen
de schepenen in de Vierschaar bijeen en, na rijpe beraadslaging,
werd Katelijne veroordeeld tot de straffe des vuurs.
De beul en zijne knechten brachten heur naar de Groote Markt van
Damme, alwaar een schavot opgericht was, hetwelk zij beklom. Op de
Markt stonden de provoost, de heraut en de rechters.
Driemaal klonken de bazuinen van den stadsheraut en deze sprak tot
het volk:
--De magistraat van Damme, medelijden gekregen hebbende met vrouwe
Katelijne, heeft haar niet willen straffen volgens al de strengheid
van de wet van de stede, maar tot teeken dat zij tooveres is, zal heur
haar verbrand worden; verder zal zij twintig gouden karolussen boete
betalen en voor drie jaar gebannen worden uit de stede van Damme,
op verbeurte van een lid.
En het volk juichte die barbaarsche goedertierenheid toe.
De beul bond Katelijne toen aan eenen paal, legde op heur geschoren
hoofd eene pruik van werk en stak die in brand. En het werk brandde
lang, en Katelijne schreeuwde en huilde van pijn.
Eindelijk werd zij losgemaakt; zij werd op eene kar buiten het
grondgebied van Damme gebracht, want heure voeten waren verbrand.
XXXIX.
Terwijl Uilenspiegel te 's-Hertogenbosch in Brabant was, wilden de
heeren van de stad hem tot hunnen nar benoemen, maar die weerdigheid
weigerde hij, zeggende: "Reizende pelgrims mogen zich nergens vestigen;
hun verblijf is de groote baan."
Rond dien tijd kwam Philippus, die koning van Engeland was, zijne
toekomstige erfstaten Vlaanderen, Brabant, Henegouwen, Holland en
Zeeland bezoeken. Hij was in zijn negen en twintigste jaar; in zijne
grijze oogen las men bittere droefgeestigheid, woeste geveinsdheid
en wreedaardige vastberadenheid. Koud was zijn aangezicht, stijf
zijn hoofd met vaalrood haar, alsmede zijn mager lichaam en zijne
schrale beenen. Langzaam en slijmerig sprak hij, alsof hij wolle in
den mond had.
Te midden van tornooien, steekspelen en feesten, bezocht hij
achtereenvolgens het vroolijke hertogdom Brabant, het rijke graafschap
Vlaanderen en zijne andere heerlijkheden. Overal beloofde hij onder
eede de privileges te zullen eerbiedigen; maar toen hij te Brussel
op 't Evangelie zwoer de Brabantsche gouden bul te zullen in stand
houden, trok zijne hand zoodanig te zamen, dat men hem het heilige
boek moest afnemen.
Hij ging naar Antwerpen, waar men drie en twintig zegebogen
oprichtte om hem te ontvangen. De stad gaf tweehonderd zeven en
tachtig duizend gulden uit om die bogen te betalen, alsmede voor
de kleedij van achttien honderd negen en zeventig kooplieden, allen
in karmozijnpanne, en voor de rijke livrei van vierhonderd zestien
lakeien en den schitterenden zijden dos van vier duizend poorters,
allen eender gekleed. Menigvuldige feesten werden gegeven door de
rederijkerskamers van bijna al de steden der Nederlanden.
Daar werden gezien met hunne narren: de Prins van Liefde, van Doornijk,
rijdende op eene zeuge, die Astarte hiet; de Koning der Zotten, van
Rijsel, die een peerd bestierde bij den steert en achter hetzelve
ging; de Prins van Genuchte, van Valencijn, die zich vermaakte met
de veesten van zijnen ezel te tellen; de Abt van Vroolijkheid, van
Atrecht, die zijn Brusselschen wijn dronk uit eene flesch, in de
gedaante van een getijdenboek, en het boek lustig om lezen vond; de
Abt der Gevulde Buiken van Ath, die gescheurde kleederen en versleten
schoenen aanhad, maar eene worst droeg, met dewelke hij zijn buiksken
vulde; de Proost van Onbezonnenheid, jonge knaap, die op een schuwe
geit zat en aldus door het volk reed, ten gevolge waarvan hij slagen
en stompen in groote menigte ontving; de Abt van den Zilveren Schotel,
van de stad Le Quesnoy die, te peerd, gebaarde zich neder te zetten
in eenen schotel, zeggende: hoe groot een beest ook weze, het toch
kan gebraden worden.
En zij vertoonden allerhande onschuldige gekheden, maar de vorst
bleef somber en stuursch.
's Avonds nog kwamen de markgraaf van Antwerpen, de burgemeesteren,
hoofdmannen en dekenen bijeen om toch iets te vinden, dat Philippus
zou doen lachen.
De markgraaf sprak:
--Hebt gij nooit hooren spreken van zeker Pierken Jacobsen, den nar
van 's-Hertogenbosch, die bekend is voor zijn aardige streken?
--Ja, spraken zij.
--Hewel, zei de markgraaf, laat ons hem ter stede ontbieden, en dat hij
iets aardigs vertoone, vermits onze nar lood in zijn schoenen heeft.
--Laat ons hem ontbieden! spraken zij.
Toen de bode van Antwerpen naar 's-Hertogenbosch kwam, zegde men hem,
dat de nar Pierken gebersten was van 't lachen; maar dat er voor
eenigen tijd een andere nar in de stad was, met name Uilenspiegel.
De bode ging hem zoeken in eene taveerne, waar hij gestoofde mosselen
aan 't eten was.
Uilenspiegel was verrukt toen hij vernam, dat het voor hem was,
dat de schepenbode van Antwerpen kwam, op een schoon peerd van het
Veurne-Ambacht en een ander peerd bij den toom houdend.
Zonder af te stijgen, vroeg de bode hem of hij geen nieuwe poetsen
kende om koning Philippus te doen lachen.
--Onder mijn haar liggen poetsen met de macht, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
En zij reden weg. De twee peerden liepen spoorslags tot Antwerpen,
met den bode en met Uilenspiegel.
Uilenspiegel verscheen vóór den markgraaf, de beide burgemeesters en
de poorters van Antwerpen.
--Wat schikt gij te doen? vroeg de markgraaf hem.
--In de lucht vliegen, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Hoe gaat gij dat aanleggen? vroeg de markgraaf.
--Weet gij wat nog minder weerd is dan eene blaas die berst?
--Neen, sprak de markgraaf.
--'t Is een geheim dat men uitbrengt, was 't antwoord van Uilenspiegel.
De feestherauten reden op hunne schoone peerden met karmozijnpanne
getoomd, door de straten, markten en pleinen van de stad met slaande
trom en schallenden hoorn. Op die wijze maakten zij bekend aan de
signoorkens en signorinnekens, dat Uilenspiegel, de nar van Damme,
op de kaai in de lucht zou vliegen, in de aanwezigheid van koning
Philippus en zijn eerweerdig, doorluchtig en adelijk gezelschap.
Rechtover de estrade des konings stond een huis op Italiaansche wijze
gebouwd, onder welks dak eene regengoot liep. En op die goot kwam
een zoldervenster uit.
Dien dag reed Uilenspiegel door de stad op een ezel. Een voetknecht
ging nevens hem. Uilenspiegel had het schoon karmozijnzijden kleed
aangetrokken, hetwelk de heeren van de stad hem gegeven hadden. Tot
hoofddeksel droeg hij eene kap, mede van karmozijnzijde, waaraan twee
ezelsooren met een belleken aan. Hij droeg een halssnoer van koperen
penningen, waarop het schild van Antwerpen prijkte. Aan de mouwen
van zijn kleed zag men aan een puntigen elleboog een paar vergulde
bellekens. Ook droeg hij puntleersjes, met een belleken aan elken top.
Zijn ezel, getoomd met karmozijnzijde, droeg op elke bil het schild
van Antwerpen, met fijn goud geborduurd.
De knecht hield met de eene hand den ezel bij den kop en met de andere
eenen tak, aan denwelken een koebelletje klingelde.
Uilenspiegel liet zijn knecht en zijn ezel op straat en klom in
de dakgoot.
Daar deed hij de bellekens klinken en strekte de armen wijd open, alsof
hij vliegen ging. Dan bukte hij zich naar koning Philippus, zeggende:
--Ik dacht, dat niemand dan ik in Antwerpen zot was, maar ik zie,
dat de stad vol gekken is. Hadt gij mij gezegd dat gij vliegen zoudt,
dan had ik u niet geloofd; maar een zot komt u zeggen dat hij het zal
doen, en gij gelooft hem! Hoe wilt gij dat ik vliege, daar ik geene
vleugelen heb?
De eenen lachten, de anderen vloekten, maar allen zegden:
--'t Is toch de waarheid.
Maar koning Philippus bleef stijf als een koning van steen.
En die van de gemeente fluisterden tot elkaar:
--'t Was de moeite niet, al die vermakelijkheden in te richten voor
zulk een zuur gezicht.
En zij gaven drie gulden aan Uilenspiegel die heenging, nadat hij
hun het karmozijnzijden kleed had teruggegeven.
--Wat zijn drie gulden in de tassche van een jonkman anders dan
een sneeuwbal vóór 't vuur, dan een volle flesch vóór uw aanschijn,
drinkebroers? Drie gulden! De bladeren vallen van de boomen, doch er
schieten nieuwe op hunne plaats; maar de guldens gaan uit de zakken
en keeren er nimmermeer in; de vlinders verdwijnen met den zomer,
en de guldens ook, hoewel zij meer dan twee esterlings wegen.
Dus sprekende, staarde Uilenspiegel naar zijne drie gulden.
--Welk fier gezicht, murmelde hij, heeft, op de zijde van den
beeldenaar, die gehelmde, geharnaste keizer Karel, met een zweerd
in eene hand en den aardbol in de andere! Door de genade Gods is
hij Roomsch keizer, koning van Spanje enz., en hij is wel genadig
voor ons, de geharnaste keizer! En hier op de keerzijde, hebt ge een
schild, op hetwelk de wapenen van zijne verschillende graafschappen,
hertogdommen en heerlijkheden prijken, met die schoone spreuke:
Da mihi virtutem contra hostes tuos: "Geef mij dapperheid tegen uwe
vijanden". Hij was dapper, inderdaad, tegen de protestanten, die have
en goed hadden, om van dezelven te erven. Ha! was ik keizer Karel,
ik liet guldens voor een iegelijk slaan; zoo iedereen rijk was,
zou niemand meer hoeven te werken.
Maar Uilenspiegel had niet lang genoegen in 't bezien van zijn geld:
weldra verzwond het in 't gerinkel van bottels en pinten.
XL.
Terwijl Uilenspiegel zich in karmozijnzijde op de dakgoot vertoonde,
had hij Nele niet gezien, die hem, onder de menigte, glimlachend
toekeek. Zij woonde te Borgerhout, omtrent Antwerpen, en zij had
gedacht, dat, als een nar voor koning Philippus moest vliegen, het
niemand anders kon zijn dan haar Uilenspiegel.
Terwijl hij droomend heenging, hoorde hij niet 't gerucht van haastige
stappen achter zich, doch hij voelde de twee handjes wel, die langs
achteren vóór zijne oogen werden gebracht. Aan Nele denkend, vroeg hij:
--Zijt gij het?
--Ja, sprak zij, ik loop achter u sedert dat gij uit de stad zijt. Kom
mede met mij.
--Maar, antwoordde hij, waar is Katelijne?
--Gij weet niet, sprak zij, dat zij onrechtveerdig als tooveres
gefolterd werd, vervolgens voor drie jaar uit Damme gebannen,
en men haar pijnigde en brandde. Ik zeg u dit, opdat gij niet
zoudt verschieten, want zij is uitzinnig ten gevolge van de hevige
smerten. Gansche nachten soms beziet ze heure voeten, zeggende:
Hansken, mijn zoete duivel, zie eens wat zij gedaan hebben met uwe
vriendinne. En heur arme voeten gelijken twee bloedige wonden. Dan
weent zij, zeggende: Andere vrouwen hebben een man of een minnaar,
ik, ik leef op deze wereld als een weduwe. Maar dan zeg ik tot haar,
dat haar Hansken boos zal wezen, als zij van hem tot anderen durft
spreken. En zij luistert naar mij gedwee als een kind, behalve wanneer
zij een os of eene koe, oorzake harer foltering, ziet; dan neemt zij
ijlings de vlucht, zonder dat iets, barreelen of beken of grachten,
haren loop kunne stuiten, totdat zij eindelijk nederzijgt aan den
zoom van een weg of tegen den muur van eene hoeve, waar ik haar ga
oprapen om heure bloedende voeten te verbinden. En ik geloof, dat
zij met het brandende werk, ook heure hersenen verbrand hebben.
En beiden waren zeer bedroefd, terwijl zij dachten aan Katelijne.
Zij kwamen bij haar en zagen heur op eene bank in de zonne zitten,
tegen den muur van heur huis. Uilenspiegel vroeg:
--Herkent gij mij?
Viermaal drie, sprak zij, is een heilig getal, en de dertiende is
Thereb. Wie zijt gij, kind dezer booze wereld?
--Ik ben Uilenspiegel, antwoordde hij, de zoon van Klaas en van
Soetkin.
Zij knikte tot teeken dat zij hem herkende; vervolgens wenkte zij
hem om nader te komen en fluisterde hem in 't oor:
--Als gij hem ziet, wiens kussen koud als de sneeuw zijn, zeg hem
dan te komen, Uilenspiegel.
Vervolgens heur verbrand haar toonende, sprak zij:
--Ik heb zeer; zij hebben mij mijnen geest afgenomen, maar als hij
komt zal hij mijn hoofd vullen, dat nu hol is van binnen. Hoort
gij? het klinkt als een klokke; 't is mijne ziel, die aan de deur
klopt om henen te gaan, daar het brandt in de helle. Als Hansken komt
en hij mijn hoofd niet wil vullen, zal ik hem zeggen er een gat in
te snijden: de ziel, die daar binnen is en klopt om buiten te komen,
bedrukt mij zoo deerlijk, dat ik het besterven zal. En nimmer slaap
ik meer, steeds wacht ik op hem, dat hij mij mijn geest teruggeve.
En nederzijgend, zuchtte zij diep.
En de boeren, die van het veld kwamen op etenstijd, als de klokken
luiden, gingen voorbij Katelijne en spraken:
--Daar is de zottinne.
En zij maakten het teeken des kruises.
En Nele en Uilenspiegel weenden, en Uilenspiegel moest zijne bedevaart
voortzetten.
XLI.
Zijn beeweg vervolgend, trad hij in dienst bij zekeren Judocus, de
kwabakker geheeten, om den wille van zijne zure en norsche tronie. De
kwabakker gaf hem voor eten drie oudbakken brooden per week en deed
hem slapen in een kot onder het dak, waar het regende en waaide dat
het een pleizier was.
Als Uilenspiegel zag, dat hij zoo slecht behandeld werd, bakte hij
zijnen baas verscheidene poetsen en onder andere deze: als men 's
morgens heel vroeg bakt, moet men 's nachts het meel builen. Nu op
een nacht dat de mane scheen, vroeg Uilenspiegel een keers om te zien,
en hij kreeg van zijn meester het volgende antwoord:
--Buil het meel in den maneschijn.
Uilenspiegel gehoorzaamde, en builde het meel op den grond, daar waar
de maan scheen.
Als de kwabakker 's morgens kwam zien naar Uilenspiegel's werk,
vond hij hem nog aan 't builen.
--Kost het meel dan geen geld meer, sprak hij, dat gij het nu op den
grond built?
--Ik heb het meel in den maneschijn gebuild, gelijk gij mij geheeten
hebt, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
De bakker antwoordde:
--Ezel, die ge zijt: 't was door eene zeef dat gij het moest doen.
--Ik meende, dat de maan eene zeef van uwe vinding was, antwoordde
Uilenspiegel. Maar er zal niet veel verloren gaan, ik zal het meel
opscheppen.
--'t Is nu te laat, antwoordde de bakker, om deeg te maken en te
bakken.
Uilenspiegel sprak:
--Baas, het deeg van onzen buurman is gereed in den trog, wil ik het
gaan nemen?
--Loop naar de galg, antwoordde de kwabakker, neem wat er te vinden is.
--Ik ga, baas, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
Hij liep naar het galgeveld en vond er de verdroogde hand van een
dief. Hij bracht ze aan den kwabakker en sprak:
Dit is eene gelukshand, die onzichtbaar maakt, wie ze draagt. Wilt
gij uwe slechte inborst verbergen?
--Ik zal u zwart maken bij het gerecht, antwoordde de kwabakker,
en gij zult zien dat gij het heerenrecht hebt overtreden.
Toen zij getweeën vóór den burgemeester stonden, wilde de kwabakker al
de misdaden van Uilenspiegel opsommen, maar deze zette groote oogen
op en maakte den kwabakker zoo grammoedig, dat hij zijne aanklacht
onderbrak om te vragen:
--Wel, wat is er?
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Gij hebt mij gezegd, dat gij mij zoodanig zwart gingt maken, dat
ik zou zien. Wel, ik zie niemendal....
--Uit mijne oogen! riep de bakker.
--Was ik in uw oogen, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, dan zou ik, als gij
ze toedeedt, er langs de neusgaten moeten uitkruipen.
De burgemeester dacht dat men hem voor den aap hield en wilde hen
niet langer aanhooren.
Uilenspiegel en de kwabakker kwamen samen buiten, de bakker hief zijn
stok op, doch Uilenspiegel sprong ter zijde en sprak:
--Baas, daar het met slagen is dat men mijn meel built, neem gij
de zemelen: dat is uwe norschheid; ik houd de bloem: dat is mijne
vroolijkheid.
En zich omkeerende, zei hij: Als ge bakken wilt--hier is de oven.
XLII.
De reizende Uilenspiegel ware geerne struikroover geworden, maar hij
zei tot zich zelven, dat hij met struiken niets verrichten kon.
Hij stapte op goed valle 't uit naar Oudenaarde, waar toen een
garnizoen Vlaamsche ruiters lag, om de stad te verdedigen tegen de
Fransche benden, die het land verwoestten lijk sprinkhanen.
De hoofdman van de ruiters was een Fries, een zekere Kornjuin. Zij
ook liepen het platteland af en knevelden het volk, dat aldus, als
naar gewoonte, langs twee kanten tegelijk opgegeten werd.
Alles was hun deeg: kiekens en kapoenen, eenden en duiven, kalveren
en verkens. Op een avond dat Kornjuin en zijne mannen met buit beladen
terugkwamen, zagen zij aan den voet van een boom Uilenspiegel liggen,
die sliep en zeker van stoverije droomde.
--Wat doet gij om te leven? vroeg Kornjuin.
--Sterven van honger, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Wat is uw ambacht?
--Reizen voor mijne zonden, de anderen zien wroeten, op de koorde
dansen, lieve gezichtjes schilderen, messenhechten snijden, op den
rommelpot spelen en op de trompet blazen.
Als Uilenspiegel zoo stout zei, dat hij op de trompet kon blazen,
was het omdat hij had hooren zeggen, dat, in het slot van Oudenaarde,
de plaats open was van torenwachter, ten gevolge van den dood van
den ouden man welke die bediening vervulde.
Kornjuin zei hem:
--Gij zult bazuinblazer van de stede wezen.
Uilenspiegel volgde hem en hij werd gebracht op een van de hoogste
torens der vestingen, in een goed verlucht hokje, dat open was voor
alle winden, behalve voor dien uit 't Zuiden.
Men zei hem, dat hij blazen moest als hij den vijand zag aankomen
en, daarom steeds het hoofd vrij en de oogen helder moest houden,
weshalve men hem niet te veel eten of drinken bracht.
De hoofdman en zijne huurlingen bleven in de toren en kermisten
heel den dag ten koste van het platteland. Daar werd meer dan
een kapoen, wiens eenige misdaad was vet te zijn, gedood en
opgesmuld. Uilenspiegel, die altijd vergeten werd en zich tevreden
moest houden met zijn mageren disch, vond in 't heel geen behagen
in den reuk van de saus. De Franschen kwamen, namen het vee mee,
doch Uilenspiegel blies het alarm niet.
Kornjuin kwam boven en vroeg:
--Waarom hebt gij niet geblazen?
Uilenspiegel sprak:
--Gij hadt kunnen denken, dat het als dank was voor mijn eten.
's Anderen daags bestelde de hoofdman een groot festijn voor zich en
zijne huurlingen, maar Uilenspiegel werd nogmaals vergeten. Zij gingen
zich deugd doen aan 't lekkere maal, toen Uilenspiegel alarm blies.
Kornjuin en zijne soldaten, meenende dat de Franschen daar waren,
verlieten de tafel en sprongen te peerd. Zij reden in allerijl de
stad uit, maar buiten vonden ze niets dan een os, die in de zonne
herkauwde, en dien zij meenamen.
Middelerwijl had Uilenspiegel zich volgestopt met vleesch en met
wijn. Toen de hoofdman terugkwam, zag hij hem lachend en met waggelende
beenen staan aan de deur van de zaal van 't festijn. Hij sprak:
--'t Is verraderswerk van alarm te blazen als gij den vijand niet ziet,
en van niet te blazen als ge hem wèl ziet.
--Mijnheer de hoofdman, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, ik heb geblazen om
mij te verlichten, want in mijn toren was ik zoodanig opgeblazen van
wind, dat ik vreesde te zullen wegvliegen. Laat mij maar ophangen,
nu of een andere maal, zoo gij ezelsvel noodig hebt voor uwe trommelen.
De hoofdman ging henen en zei geen woord.
Maar Oudenaarde kreeg tijding, dat de genadige keizer Karel de stede
zou komen bezoeken met een doorluchtig gezelschap. Bij die gelegenheid
gaven de schepenen aan Uilenspiegel eenen bril, om Zijne Majesteit
beter te zien aankomen. Uilenspiegel moest driemaal blazen, zoodra
hij den keizer van Leupegem zag aankomen op een kwartier gaans van
de Borgpoort.
Die van de stad zouden aldus den tijd hebben de klokken te luiden,
het vuurwerk in gereedheid te brengen, het vleesch in den oven te
zetten, de vaten aan te steken.
Zekeren dag, dat de wind uit Brabant woei en de hemel helder was,
zag Uilenspiegel, rond den middag, een grooten troep ruiters op
fiere peerden, op den weg die naar Leupegem leidt. Sommigen droegen
banieren. Degene, die statig voorop reed, had een goudlakensche
muts op met groote pluimen. Hij droeg een kleed van bruine panne,
met bloemen geborduurd.
Uilenspiegel zette zijn bril op en zag dat het keizer Karel was,
die hoogstgenadiglijk aan die van Oudenaarde kwam toestaan hem hunne
beste wijnen en fijnste vleezen op te dienen.
Heel die troep kwam stapvoets af en snoof de frissche lucht op, die
eetlust doet krijgen; maar Uilenspiegel zei tot zich zelven, dat die
lieden de vette brokken gewoon waren en zij niet zouden sterven zoo
zij eens over den pot sprongen, daar vasten gezond is. Hij zag ze
dus komen, maar blies niet op de trompet.
Lachend en pratend kwamen zij nader, terwijl Zijne Heilige Majesteit
het hoofd voorover boog, als om te zien of er in zijnen buik plaats
genoeg was voor het festijn van die zijner goede stad Oudenaarde. Doch
hij was verwonderd en ontevreden dat geenerlei klokke luidde, om
zijne komst te kondschappen.
Ondertusschen kwam een boer de stad binnenloopen om te zeggen, dat hij
in de omstreken een Franschen aanhang gezien had, die op Oudenaarde
aanrukte, om alles te stelen en te rooven.
Op die rede sloot de poortwachter zijne poort en liet de andere
poortwachters door een knaap der gemeente verwittigen. Maar de wacht
kermiste zonder van iets te weten.
Zijne Majesteit kwam nader, zeer ontstemd, geen klokkengelui of
kanongebulder te vernemen. Te vergeefs de ooren spitsend, hoorde
hij niets dan de beiaard, die het half uur speelde. Hij kwam vóór de
poort, vond die gesloten en sloeg er op met de vuisten om opengedaan
te worden.
En de heeren van zijn gevolg, verstoord als Zijne Majesteit, gromden
bittere woorden. De poortwachter, die omhoog op de vestingen stond,
riep hun toe dat zij moesten stille zijn, of dat hij hun wat kogels
zou zenden, hetwelk hun ongeduld eenigszins zou koelen.
Doch Zijne Majesteit, in woede ontstoken, riep:
--Blind verken, herkent gij uwen keizer niet?
De poortwachter antwoordde, dat de meest vergulde verkens niet altijd
de kleinsten waren, dat hij overigens goed wist, dat de Franschen
spotters van nature waren, en keizer Karel voor 't oogenblik oorloogde
in Italië, en dus niet voor de poorten van Oudenaarde wezen kon.
Daarop schreeuwden de keizer en de heeren nog luider, zeggende:
--Als gij niet opendoet, laten wij U braden op eene lans. En eerst
zult gij uwe sleutels inslikken.
Op het gerucht dat zij maakten, kwam een oudgediende uit de plaats waar
't geschut stond. Hij keek over den muur en sprak tot den poortwachter:
--Gij zijt mis, dat is onze keizer; ik herken hem goed, hoewel hij
verouderd is sedert hij Maria Vander Gheynst van hier naar 't kasteel
van Lalaing voerde.
De poortwachter viel stokkedood van schrik, de soldaat nam de sleutels
en deed de poort open.
De keizer vroeg waarom men hem zoolang had laten wachten; als de
soldaat hem het geval uitgelegd had, beval Zijne Majesteit de poort
weder te sluiten en de ruiters van Kornjuin te doen komen. Hij deed
ze vóór hem gaan, slaande op de tamboerijnen en spelend op de pijpen.
Weldra ontwaakten de klokken de eene na de andere en begonnen zij te
bimbommelen. Aldus voorafgegaan, kwam Zijne Majesteit met keizerlijk
lawaai op de Groote Markt. Burgemeesteren en schepenen waren op het
stadhuis vergaderd; schepen Jan Guigelaer kwam met veel gedruisch de
zaal binnen en riep:
--Keizer Karel is alhier! Keizer Karel is alhier!
Ten uiterst verschrikt bij het hooren van die tijding, liepen
burgemeesteren, schepenen en raadsheeren buiten om, in korps, keizer
Karel te begroeten, terwijl hunne knapen de stede rondliepen om het
vuurwerk in gereedheid te brengen, de kapoenen op 't vuur te zetten
en de tonnen aan te steken.
Mannen, vrouwlieden en kinderen riepen tot elkander:
--Keizer Karel is op de Groote Markt!
Weldra was het volk in groote menigte naar de Markt gestroomd.
Grammoedig vroeg de keizer aan de twee burgemeesteren, of zij niet
verdienden gehangen te worden, om aldus te kort te komen aan den
eerbied, den vorst verschuldigd.
De burgemeesteren antwoordden, dat zij zulks inderdaad verdienden,
maar dat Uilenspiegel, de torenwachter, het meer verdiende, vermits
hij, op de mare van 't bezoek van Zijne Majesteit, op den toren gezet
werd met een goeden bril, met uitdrukkelijk bevel driemaal te blazen,
zoodra hij den keizerlijken stoet in het gezicht kreeg. Maar hij had
het niet gedaan.
De keizer, nog immer gram, deed Uilenspiegel komen.
--Waarom, sprak hij, hebt gij bij mijne komst niet geblazen, terwijl
gij een goeden bril hadt?
Dit zeggende, streek hij de hand over de oogen, om den wille van de
zonne, en zoo bekeek hij Uilenspiegel.
Deze streek ook de hand over de oogen en antwoordde dat hij, sedert
hij Zijne Heilige Majesteit door zijne vingeren zag kijken, geen bril
meer wilde bezigen.
De keizer zei hem, dat hij ging gehangen worden; de poortwachter zei
dat het wel besteed was, en de burgemeesteren zeiden geen woord om
die sententie goed te keuren of tegen te spreken, want zij waren met
schrik vervuld.
De beul en zijne knechten werden geroepen. Zij kwamen met eene ladder
en een nieuwe koorde, grepen Uilenspiegel bij den kraag en deden hem
vóór de honderd ruiters van Kornjuin gaan. In stee van hem gerust
te laten om zijne gebeden te zeggen, begonnen deze hem te sarren en
te plagen.
Het gemeen, dat volgde, zegde:
--'t Is een ongemeene wreedheid, dien armen jongen voor zulk een
gering vergrijp ter dood te veroordeelen.
En de wevers, die daar in groote menigte onder de wapens stonden,
zegden:
--Wij zullen Uilenspiegel niet laten hangen; dat is in strijd met de
costume van Oudenaarde.
Doch men kwam aan het galgeveld. Uilenspiegel werd op de ladder
getrokken, en de beul deed de koorde rond zijnen hals. De wevers
drongen rond de galge. De provoost was daar, met de roede der justitie
bij zich, met dewelke hij op bevel van den keizer het teeken tot de
uitvoering moest geven.
Heel het vergaderde volk riep:
--Genade! genade voor Uilenspiegel!
Uilenspiegel, van op zijne ladder, sprak:
--Medelijden! genadige keizer!
De keizer hief de hand op en sprak:
--Als die deugniet mij iets vraagt, dat ik niet doen kan, schenk ik
hem het leven!
--Spreek, Uilenspiegel! riep het volk.
De vrouwen weenden en zeiden:
--Hij moet sterven, de jongen, want de keizer kan alles.
En allen riepen:
--Spreek, Uilenspiegel!
--Heilige Majesteit, ik zal U noch geld, noch erfgoederen, noch het
leven vragen, doch enkel iets voor hetwelk gij beloven moet, als
ik zoo spreken durf, mij niet te zullen doen geeselen of radbraken,
vóór dat ik naar de andere wereld vertrek.
--Dat beloof ik, sprak de keizer.
--Majesteit, zei Uilenspiegel, ik vraag dat, vóór ik gehangen worde,
gij mijnen mond komt kussen met denwelken ik geen Vlaamsch spreke....
De keizer, die lachte evenals heel de menigte, antwoordde:
--Ik kan niet doen wat gij mij vraagt, en gij zult niet gehangen
worden, Uilenspiegel.
Maar de burgemeesteren en schepenen veroordeelde hij om, zes maanden
lang, eenen bril van achteren op het hoofd te dragen, opdat, zegde
hij, als die van Oudenaarde van voren niet zien, zij tenminste van
achteren zouden zien.
En, bij keizerlijk decreet, staat die bril nog heden op het wapen
van de stad.
En Uilenspiegel ging zediglijk henen, met een kleine tassche vol geld,
dat de vrouwen hem hadden gegeven.
XLIII.
Uilenspiegel, die te Luik op de vischmarkt liep, zag een dikken
jongeling, die een net met allerhande gevogelte onder den arm droeg
en nog een ander vulde met schelvisch, forellen, paling en karpers.
Uilenspiegel herkende Lamme Goedzak.
--Wat doet gij hier, Lamme? vroeg hij.
--Gij weet, sprak hij, dat die van Vlaanderen welkom zijn in het
zoete land van Luik; ik ben hier heengetrokken door de liefde. En gij?
--Ik zoek een meester om brood te verdienen, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--'t Is droge kost, zei Lamme. Een rozenkrans van ortolanen met eene
lijster, als credo, staat verre daarboven.
--Zijt gij rijk? vroeg Uilenspiegel hem.
Lamme Goedzak antwoordde:
--'k Verloor mijn vader, mijn moeder en mijn jongere zuster, die mij
altijd sloeg. Ik erfde hun vermogen en ik woon met eene dienstmaagd,
die maar één oog heeft, zeer ervaren in de kunste van braden en koken.
--Wil ik uwe visch en uw gevogelte dragen, vroeg Uilenspiegel.
--Ja, sprak Lamme.
En beiden slenterden voort langs de markt.
Eensklaps vroeg Lamme:
--Weet gij waarom gij niet wijs zijt?
--Neen, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
Omdat gij dit eten in de hand draagt, in stee van in uwe maag.
--Inderdaad, Lamme, antwoordde Uilenspiegel; maar sinds ik geen brood
meer heb, willen de ortolanen mij niet meer bezien.
--Gij zult er hebben, Uilenspiegel, sprak Lamme, en gij zult mij
dienen als gij mijne dienstmaagd vermoogt te bevallen.
Terwijl zij voortgingen, toonde Lamme aan Uilenspiegel, een schoone,
lieve, poezele meid, in zijde gekleed, die langs de markt liep en
Lamme toelonkte.
Een oud man, heur vader, ging achter heur met twee netten, één met
visch, het ander met wild.
--Die, sprak Lamme, die wordt mijne gade.
--Ja, sprak Uilenspiegel, ik ken heur, 't is een Vlaamsche van
Zottegem; zij woont in de rue Vinave-d'Isle, en de buren zeggen,
dat hare moeder in heure plaats de straat vóór de deur keert en dat
heur vader heure hemdenen strijkt.
Doch Lamme antwoordde niet en sprak blijde:
--Zij heeft mij bezien.
Getweeën kwamen zij aan het huis van Lamme, omtrent eene brug over
de Maas, en Lamme klopte aan de deur. Een eenoogige dienstmaagd kwam
opendoen. Uilenspiegel zag dat zij oud, lang, mager en norsch was.
--Sanginne, sprak Lamme tot haar, wilt gij dezen jongen man om u te
helpen in uw werk?
--Ik zal hem probeeren, sprak zij.
--Neem hem, sprak hij, en laat hem de lekkernijen van uwe keuken
proeven.
Sanginne bracht toen drie zwarte pensen, eene pint kuite en eene
homp brood.
Terwijl Uilenspiegel aan 't eten was, smulde Lamme ook aan eene pens.
--Weet gij, vroeg hij hem, waar onze ziel woont?
--Neen, Lamme, sprak Uilenspiegel.
--In onze maag, antwoordde Lamme, daar wordt ze steeds doorploegd
om ons voortdurend nieuwe geesteskracht te schenken. En welke zijn
onze beste gezellen? Het zijn de fijne brokken, begoten met wijn van
de Maas.
--Ja, sprak Uilenspiegel, pensen zijn aangenaam gezelschap voor een
eenzame ziele.
--Hij vraagt nog, Sanginne, sprak Lamme.
Deze reis gaf Sanginne hem witte pensen.
Terwijl Uilenspiegel zich volstopte, zei Lamme, in gedachten
verslonden:
--Als ik zal sterven, zal mijn maag met mij sterven, en hier beneden,
in het vagevuur, zal men mij laten vasten, en laten ronddwalen met
een slappen en ledigen buik.
--De zwarte waren beter, zei Uilenspiegel.
--Gij hebt er zes gegeten, sprak Sanginne, gij krijgt geene meer.
--Uilenspiegel, sprak Lamme, gij zult hier goed behandeld worden,
en eten lijk ik.
--Dat woord zal ik onthouden, zei Uilenspiegel.
Uilenspiegel, ziende dat hij at lijk Lamme, was gelukkig. De pensen
die hij gegeten had, gaven hem zulken moed, dat hij dien dag ketels,
potten en pateelen deed blinken lijk zonnen.
Daar hij goed leven had in dit huis, verbleef hij geerne in kelder en
keuken, en liet hij den zolder aan de katten. Eens had Sanginne twee
kiekens te braden, en beval tot Uilenspiegel aan het spit te draaien,
terwijl zij naar de markt om de toespijzen ging.
Als de twee kiekens gebraden waren, at Uilenspiegel er een op.
Sanginne kwam terug en ze sprak:
--Er waren twee kiekens, en ik zie er maar een meer.
--Doe uw ander oog open en gij zult ze alle twee zien, antwoordde
Uilenspiegel.
Woedend ging zij dat vertellen aan Lamme Goedzak, die naar de keuken
kwam en aldus sprak tot Uilenspiegel:
--Waarom spot gij met de meid? Er waren twee kiekens.
--Inderdaad, Lamme, sprak Uilenspiegel, maar als ik hier binnenkwam,
hebt gij gezegd dat ik zou eten en drinken als gij. Er waren twee
kiekens: een heb ik gegeten, het ander is voor u; mijne vreugd is
voorbij, de uwe nog niet; zijt gij niet gelukkiger dan ik?
--Ja, sprak Lamme glimlachend, maar doe immer alles wat Sanginne u
zal zeggen, en gij zult maar half werk hebben.
--Ik zal mijn best doen, Lamme, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
Telkens dat Sanginne hem dan ook iets gebood, deed hij het maar half,
als zij hem zei van twee akers water te putten, bracht hij er maar
een; als zij hem vroeg aan de tonne den pot met kuite te vullen,
goot hij onderweg de helft in zijn keelgaat, en zoo verder.
Ten slotte werd Sanginne het moede en ze zei tot Lamme dat, als die
deugniet langer in huis bleef, zij dadelijk heenging.
Lamme ging tot Uilenspiegel en zei:
--Gij moet heengaan, mijn jongen, niettegenstaande dat gij hier goed
waart in huis. Hoor dien haan kraaien, 't is twee uren na middag,
dat is een teeken van regen. Liever zette ik u niet buiten, als er
slecht weder op handen is; maar bedenk, mijn jongen, Sanginne houdt met
heur gekook en gebraad mijn levenslicht brandend; als zij mij verlaat,
moet ik sterven. Ga heen dus, mijn vriend, op Gods genade, en neem deze
drie gulden en dezen krans worsten, om u tot vertroosting te dienen.
En Uilenspiegel trok beschaamd en beteuterd henen, want hij betreurde
Lamme en zijne keuken.
XLIV.
De slachtmaand kwam te Damme en elders, maar 't was een late
winter. Noch sneeuw, noch koude, noch regen; de zonne scheen van 's
morgens tot 's avonds, de kinderen stoeiden in het stof van straten en
wegen; en kooplieden, kramers, goudsmeden, wagenmakers en werklieden
kwamen 's avonds na het eten, op de zulle hunner deur, kijken naar den
immerblauwen hemel, naar de boomen, die nog hunne bladeren hadden,
naar de ooievaars, die op de daken zaten en de zwaluwen, die nog
niet vertrokken waren. De rozen hadden driemaal gebloeid en botten
voor de vierde reize; de nachten waren zoel, de vogeltjes kweelden
in de bosschen.
Die van Damme zegden:
--De winter is dood, laat ons hem verbranden.
En zij maakten een grooten man met een berensnoet, een langen vlassen
baard en haar van schavelingen. Zij deden hem witte kleederen aan en
verbrandden hem in groote plechtigheid.
Klaas was weemoedig; hij zegende geenszins den immerblauwen hemel,
noch de zwaluwen die niet wilden vertrekken. Want te Damme brandde
niemand meer kolen, tenzij voor de keuken, en daar iedereen er
daarvoor genoeg had, ging niemand er koopen bij Klaas, die al zijne
spaarpenningen uitgegeven had om zijn voorraad in te doen.
De kooldrager stond op de zulle zijner deur, toen hij zijn neus door
een koel windeken voelde streelen,
--Ha! sprak hij, daar komt mijn brood aanwaaien.
Maar het koel windeken bleef niet waaien, en de hemel bleef immer
blauw, en de bladeren wilden niet vallen. En Klaas weigerde zijn
wintervoorraad voor halfprijs te verkoopen aan den gierigaard
Grijpstuiver, den deken der vischverkoopers. En weldra was er gebrek
in de arme stulp.
XLV.
Doch koning Philippus had geen honger; hij at gebakjes bij zijne
gemalin, Maria de leelijke, van het koninklijk huis der Tudor's. Hij
beminde heur niet, doch hoopte die tengere vrouw te bevruchten om
aan de Engelsche natie een Spaanschen koning te geven.
Maar de verbintenis van een steen met een brandende kool mislukte haar
doel. Toch waren Philippus en Maria genoeg verbonden om protestanten
met honderden te doen sterven door het vuur en het water.
Als Philippus niet uit Londen was, of als hij niet, onder eenige
vermomming, in het een of ander slecht kot zijn vermaak zocht, bracht
de nacht de beide echtgenooten bij elkander.
Dan leunde koningin Maria, in schoone Iersche kant en fijn Doornijksch
lijnwaad gehuld, tegen het echtelijk bed, terwijl Philippus keek of
hij bij zijne vrouw geenerlei teeken van zwangerschap zag; doch niets
ziende, werd hij kwaad en bekeek de toppen zijner vingeren zonder
een woord te uiten. Teederlijk zag de vorstinne hem aan; smeekte
den ijskouden Philippus om liefde. Niets ontzag zij, tranen, kreten,
noch smeekingen om een kus te ontvangen van hem, die heur zijn minne
niet schonk.
Als een uitzinnige vrouw lachte en weende zij tegelijk om hem te
verteederen; doch lachen noch tranen vermochten dit steenen herte
te smelten.
Als een verliefde slang, kronkelde zij zich, sloeg zij te vergeefs
hare armen rond hem en trok zij tegen heur hert de smalle borstkas,
waar de wanstaltige ziel van den bloedigen koning in huisde; maar
hij verroerde zich niet.
De arme vrouw deed heur best lieftallig te zijn; zij gaf hem al de
zoete namen, die de minnezieken geven aan de verkorene heurs herten:
Philippus bekeek de toppen zijner vingeren.
Soms antwoordde hij:
--Zult gij nooit kinderen hebben?
Op die rede boog Maria het hoofd.
--Is het mijne schuld, sprak zij, zoo ik onvruchtbaar ben? Heb
medelijden met mij: ik leef als eene weduwe.
--Waarom hebt gij geene kinderen? sprak Philippus.
Toen viel de vorstinne op het tapijt, als door den dood getroffen. En
hare oogen baadden in tranen, en zij hadde bloed geweend, hadde
zij gekunnen.
En aldus wreekte God de slachtofferen, waarmede de beulen Engelands
bodem hadden bedekt.
XLVI.
Het gerucht liep, dat keizer Karel van zins was het recht van
erflating te ontnemen aan al degenen, die in de kloosters stierven,
hetgeen den Paus grootelijks mishaagde.
Uilenspiegel, die toen in de vallei der Maas was, dacht dat de keizer
aldus te allen kant voordeel halen zou, want hij erfde als de familie
niet erfde. Hij zette zich neder aan den oever van den stroom en
wierp zijne lijn met het aas uit. Vervolgens knaagde hij aan een oude
broodkorst; het speet hem wel, dat hij er geen kroes wijn bij had, maar
hij zegde tot zich zelven: men kan 't niet altijd naar wensch hebben.
Toen wierp hij een stuk van zijn brood in 't water, want wie zijn
maaltijd niet deelt met zijn evennaaste, is niet weerd dat hij leeft.
Een grondeling kwam het brood rieken en opende onnoozel den bek, in
den waan, dat het brood er van zelf ging in vallen. Terwijl hij aldus
in de lucht keek, werd hij eensklaps ingeslikt door een verradelijken
snoek, die als een pijl op hem was toegeschoten.
Een karper, die argeloos in de lucht naar de vliegen hapte, onderging
hetzelfde lot. Als de snoek verzadigd was, bleef hij onbeweeglijk stil,
de kleine vischjes versmadend, die pijlsnel van hem wegzwommen. Terwijl
hij aldus in trotschheid zijn gemak nam, schoot een hongerige,
vraatzuchtige snoek met open muil op hem toe. Een woedend gevecht
ontstond en weldra zag het water rondom hen rood van bloed. De
verzadigde snoek verdedigde zich slecht tegen den hongerige, die wat
achteruit zwom, zijn aandrift nam en op zijn tegenstrever toeschoot,
welke hem met open muil afwachtte en de helft van zijn kop inslikte;
hij wilde hem weder uit den muil stooten, doch hij slaagde er niet in,
om den wille van zijne haaktanden. En beide spartelden wanhopiglijk.
Aldus aaneengehecht, zagen zij den sterken angel niet, die, aan een
zijden snoer gebonden, langzaam omhoog kwam en in de vinne drong van
den verzadigden snoek, beide optrok en ze met krachtigen zwenk op
het gras smeet.
Uilenspiegel sneed hun de keel af en sprak:
--Snoeken, mijne vrienden, mocht gij de paus en de keizer zijn, die
elkander verslinden, en ik het wakkere volk dat u beiden opscheert,
op het uur dat God zal believen!
XLVII.
En Katelijne, die Borgerhout niet verlaten had, dwaalde steeds door
de velden en herhaalde gedurig: "Hansken, mijn man, zij hebben
vuur op mijn hoofd gelegd; maak er een gat in, dat mijne ziel er
uit kome. Helaas! zij klopt altijd en elke klop doet zeer als een
hamerslag."
En Nele verzorgde de arme uitzinnige, en treurig dacht zij aan heuren
vriend Uilenspiegel.
En te Damme bond Klaas zijne mutsaards en verkocht zijne kolen;
en menigwerf werd hij droefgeestig als hij dacht aan Uilenspiegel,
den banneling, die nog in langen tijd niet zou mogen terugkeeren naar
de ouderlijke stulp.
Soetkin zat heele dagen aan het venster te kijken of zij heuren zoon
niet zag aankomen.
Deze was nu bij Keulen en kreeg lust in 't hovenieren.
Hij ging zich als knecht verhuren bij Jan van Zuursmoel, die, ten
tijde dat hij kapitein der landsknechten was, wegens wanbetaling van
soldij bijna gehangen geweest was, weshalve hij een grooten afkeer
had van hennep, door de boeren kennep genoemd.
Op zekeren dag nam Jan van Zuursmoel Uilenspiegel mede naar zijn akker,
waarnaast een dagwand, geheel met kennep beplant.
Jan van Zuursmoel sprak tot Uilenspiegel:
--Telkenmale dat gij die leelijke plant ziet, moet gij ze met zooveel
verachting bejegenen als gij maar kunt, want zij dient tot rad en
tot galg.
--Ik zal het onthouden, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
Eens nu dat Jan van Zuursmoel met eenige vrienden aan tafel zat,
zei de keukenmeid tot Uilenspiegel:
--Ga naar den kelder en haal er den zennep, wat toen mosterd bediedde.
Uilenspiegel opzettelijk kennep in plaats van zennep verstaande,
bejegende den mosterdpot met de meest mogelijke verachting en kwam
hem vervolgens op de tafel stellen, heimelijk lachend.
--Waarom lacht gij? vroeg Jan van Zuursmoel. Meent gij dat onze
neuzen van koper zijn? Eet zelf dien zennep, mits gij hem zelven
gereedgemaakt hebt.
--Ik eet liever kaneelkoekjes, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
Jan van Zuursmoel stond recht om hem te slaan.
--Wat hebt gij in dien mosterdpot gedaan? sprak hij.
--Wel baas, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, herinnert gij u niet den dag, toen
ik u moest volgen naar den akker en gij mij, den zennep aanwijzende,
zegdet: "Overal waar gij die leelijke plant ziet, moet gij ze met
zooveel verachting bejegenen als gij maar kunt, want zij dient tot
rad en tot galg." En ik heb het gedaan, baas, ik heb ze al mijne
verachting uitgedrukt; gaat ge mij nu slaan omdat ik gehoorzaam was?
--Ik heb kennep gezeid en niet zennep, riep Jan van Zuursmoel.
--Baas, ge hebt zennep gezeid en niet kennep, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
Nog langen tijd twistten zij aldus voort, Uilenspiegel op nederigen
toon, Jan van Zuursmoel met een woedend geschreeuw, waarin hij de
woorden hennep, zennep, kemp-zemp, zemp-kemp ondereen mengde als een
verwarde streng zijde.
En de gasten lachten als duivels, die zich goed doen aan
preekheerenribben en kettermeestersnieren.
Maar Uilenspiegel moest de deur uit.
XLVIII.
Nele was nog zeer bedroefd voor heur zelve en voor heure uitzinnige
moeder.
Als Uilenspiegel zich bij een kleermaker verhuurde, zei deze tot hem:
--Als gij naait, naai dicht aaneen, dat ik de steken niet
zie. Uilenspiegel ging zich onder eene tonne zetten en begon daar
te naaien.
--Wat is dàt nu? riep de kleermaker.
--Ik ben in de ton gekropen om te naaien, dan kunt gij immers de
steken niet zien? antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Kom, sprak de kleermaker, zet u hier neer op de tafel, en stik uwe
steken dicht bij elkander, en maak het kleed als deze wolf.--Wolf
was de naam van een boerenwambuis.
Uilenspiegel nam het wambuis, sneed het aan stukken, naaide het aaneen,
zooveel als hij kon in de gedaante van een wolf.
Toen de kleermaker dat zag, riep hij uit:
--Wat duivel? maakt gij daar?
--Een wolf, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Leelijke spotter, sprak de kleermaker, ik had u gezegd van een
wolf te maken, 't is waar, maar gij weet toch wel, dat een wolf een
boerenwambuis is.
Eenigen tijd naderhand zegde hij hem:
--Jongen, gooi nog eens gauw de mouwen aan dien bovenkerel daar,
eer gij slapen gaat.
Uilenspiegel hing den bovenkerel aan eenen nagel en bracht heel den
nacht door met de mouwen naar het kleedingstuk te werpen.
Op het leven dat hij maakte, kwam de kleermaker kijken.
--Deugniet, sprak hij, welke kwade poets zijt gij mij nu aan 't bakken?
--Gij heet dat een kwade poets? antwoordde Uilenspiegel. Bezie die
mouwen, heel den nacht gooi ik ze naar den bovenkerel, en ze blijven
er nog niet op.
--Dat spreekt van zelf, zei de kleermaker, daarom gooi ik u op straat,
misschien blijft gij er op.
XLIX.
Als Katelijne bij een of anderen braven gebuur was, die op heur wilde
letten, ging Nele verre, verre alleen, zelfs tot Antwerpen, langsheen
de Schelde of elders, turend naar de wiegelende schuitjes en naar de
stoffige wegen, of ze soms heuren vriend Uilenspiegel niet ontwaarde.
Eens dat Uilenspiegel te Hamburg op de jaarmarkt was, zag hij
overal kooplieden, en onder hen, eenige oude joden, woekeraars en
schacheraars.
Uilenspiegel, die ook wilde koopmanschap drijven, raapte eenige
peerdevijgen op en droeg ze mee naar huis, 't is te zeggen naar een
hoek van den vestingmuur. Daar liet hij ze drogen. Vervolgens kocht
hij roode en groene zijde, van dewelke hij zakjes maakte; daarin
stak hij de peerdevijgen, en hij bond de zakjes toe met een lint,
alsof er muskus in stak.
Vervolgens maakte hij een houten bakje, hetwelk hij met een oude koord
om zijn hals hing, en hij kwam op de markt met het bakje vol roode
en groene zakjes, 's Avonds stelde hij een keersken midden tusschen
de zakjes, om ze te verlichten.
Als men hem kwam vragen wat hij verkocht, antwoordde hij op
geheimzinnigen toon:
--Ik zal het u zeggen, maar spreek niet te luide.
--Wat is het dan? vroegen de klanten.
--Het zijn, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, profetische zaadkorrels, die
recht van Arabië naar Vlaanderen kwamen; zij zijn met groote kunste
gereedgemaakt door meester Abdul-Medil, afstammeling van den grooten
Mahomed.
De klanten zeiden tot elkander:
't Is een Turk.
Anderen spraken:
--Maar neen, 't is een pelgrim, die uit Vlaanderen komt; hoort gij
't niet aan zijne tale?
En armoedige, in lompen gehulde liefhebbers spraken:
--Geef ons eenige profetische zaadkorrels.
--Als gij guldens zult hebben om te betalen, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
En de armoedige, in lompen gehulde liefhebbers gingen beteuterd henen,
zeggende:
--Alles is toch voor de rijken hier op de wereld!
Maar weldra werd op de markt het gerucht verspreid, dat daar een
Vlaming was met profetische zaadkorrels.
--Ja, zeiden de poorters tot elkander, ze zijn te Jeruzalem op het graf
van Jezus Christus gewijd, maar men zegt dat hij ze niet wil verkoopen.
En de poorters kwamen bij Uilenspiegel en vroegen hem van zijne
zaadkorrels.
Maar Uilenspiegel, die groote winsten wilde opstrijken, antwoordde dat
zij niet rijp genoeg waren, en hij hield het oog op twee rijke joden,
die langs de markt slenterden.
--Ik zou wel eens willen weten, sprak een der poorters, wat er geworden
zal van mijn schip, dat op zee is.
--Het zal ten hemel varen, als de baren hoog genoeg rijzen, antwoordde
Uilenspiegel.
Een ander liet hem zijn dochter zien, een blozende, poezele meid,
en vroeg hem of het goed met haar zou loopen.
--Alles loopt zooals de natuur het wil, antwoordde Uilenspiegel,
want hij had het meisje een sleutel zien geven aan een jongen man,
die, glanzend van geluk, aan Uilenspiegel vroeg:
--Koopman, geef mij een van uwe profetische zakjes, opdat ik wete of
ik dezen nacht alleene zal slapen.
--Er staat geschreven, sprak Uilenspiegel, wie verleiding zaait,
zal horens maaien.
De jonge snaak was grammoedig en vroeg:
--Wat wilt gij zeggen?
--De zaadkorrels zeggen, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, dat zij u wenschen
een gelukkig huwelijk en een vrouw, die u geen Vulcanus-hoed
opzet. Kent gij dat hoofddeksel?
Vervolgens sprak hij op den toon van een zedenpreeker:
--Want de vrouw die een godspenning geeft op den huwelijkskoop,
geeft naderhand heel de waar aan anderen weg.
Stoutweg vroeg de meid aan Uilenspiegel:
--Ziet men dat allemaal in uwe profetische zakjes?
--Men ziet er mede eenen sleutel in, fluisterde Uilenspiegel heur
stil in het oor.
Maar de jongeling was weg met den sleutel.
Eensklaps zag Uilenspiegel een dief van den stal van een spekslachter
eene worst nemen van eene elle lang en die onder zijn mantel
verbergen. Maar de koopman zag het niet. Blijgezind kwam de dief bij
Uilenspiegel, en hij vroeg hem:
--Wat verkoopt gij daar, ongeluksprofeet?
--Zakjes, waarin gij zult zien dat uwe liefde voor de worsten u naar
de galg zal brengen.
Op die rede nam de dief ijlings de vlucht, terwijl de bestolen
koopman riep:
--Houdt den dief! houdt den dief!
Maar deze was de gaten uit.
Terwijl Uilenspiegel sprak, kwamen de twee rijke Joden, die met
aandacht geluisterd hadden, naar hem toe en vroegen:
--Wat verkoopt gij daar, Vlaming?
--Zakjes, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--En wat ziet men met uwe profetische zaadkorrels? vroegen zij weder.
--Men ziet de toekomst, als men op de zaadkorrels zuigt, antwoordde
Uilenspiegel.
De twee joden spraken stille tot elkander, en de oudste zei tot
den anderen:
--Zoo zouden wij weten wanneer onze Messias komt; dat ware voor ons
een groote vertroosting. Laat ons een van die zakjes koopen.
--Hoeveel, uwe zakjes? vroegen zij.
--Vijftig gulden, antwoordde Uilenspiegel. Is het te veel, trekt dan
maar op. Wie den akker niet koopt, heeft ook den vetten mest niet
van noode.
Ziende dat Uilenspiegel zoo vastberaden was, telden zij hem de
somme en namen zij een van de zakjes. Zij trokken er mee naar
hunne vergaderplaats, alwaar weldra al de joden in groote menigte
heenstroomden, toen zij gehoord hadden, dat de twee ouden een geheim
hadden gekocht, met hetwelk zij de komst van den Messias konden
voorzeggen.
Zoodra dit gekend was, wilden allen, zonder betalen, aan het zakje
zuigen; maar de oudste, die het zakje gekocht en betaald had en Jehu
hiet, wilde alleen de eer en 't genot hebben.
--Zonen van Israël, sprak hij, het zakje in de hand houdend, de
Christenen bespotten ons; zij maken jacht op ons, en roepen achter
ons alsof wij cahorsijnen of woekeraars waren. De Philistijnen willen
ons nog dieper dan den grond doen buigen; zij spuwen ons in 't gelaat,
want God heeft onze bogen ontspannen en de teugels losgelaten. Heere,
God van Abraham, van Isaäc en van Jacob, hoelang nog moet het kwaad
ons geworden, terwijl wij het goede verbeiden; hoelang moeten de
duisternissen heerschen, terwijl wij het licht verwachten? Goddelijke
Messias, zult gij weldra op de aarde nederdalen? Wanneer zullen de
Christenen zich verschuilen in holen en spelonken, bevend voor de
kastijding, die zij bij uwe verschijning zullen ontvangen?
En de joden riepen:
--Kom Messias! Zuig, Jehu!
Jehu zoog aan het zakje en, met walg spuwend, riep hij jammerend uit:
--Ik zeg U, in der waarheid, dat het drek is; de Vlaamsche pelgrim
is een dief.
Toen sprongen al de joden bij, en zij openden het zakje. Als zij zagen
wat er in stak, liepen zij in woede naar de jaarmarkt om Uilenspiegel
te vinden, maar deze had niet op hen gewacht.
L.
Een man van Damme, die aan Klaas zijne kolen niet kon betalen, had
hem het schoonste van zijn kateil gegeven, zijnde een handboog met
twaalf goed aangezette pijlen.
En als er niet te werken was, ging Klaas op jacht: meer dan één
beestje, te groot liefhebber van kool, werd door hem gedood en
veranderd in hazepeper.
Klaas zette zich toen gretig te eten, en Soetkin zag naar den eenzamen
weg en zeide:
--Thijl, mijn zoon, riekt gij den lekkeren geur van de saus
niet?... Ongetwijfeld heeft hij nu honger.
En droomerig, had zij hem zijn deel van 't festijn willen wegzetten.
--Als hij honger heeft, sprak Klaas, is het zijne schuld; dat hij
terugkome en hij zal eten als wij.
Klaas hield duiven; ook hoorde hij geerne, rondom zich, distelvinken,
leeuwerikken, musschen en andere vogelen zingen en piepen, en
schoot hij geerne muizenvalken en speurgalen, die de kleine vogelen
verslinden.
Nu, eens dat hij in zijne lochting kolen mat, toonde Soetkin hem een
grooten vogel, die in de lucht boven het duivenhok zweefde.
Klaas nam zijn handboog en sprak:
--De duivel redde Zijne Sperwerachtigheid!
Toen hij den pijl in den boog had gestoken, hield hij zich in de
lochting, alwaar hij al de bewegingen van den vogel met de oogen
volgde om hem niet te missen. Het was valavond. Klaas kon enkel een
zwarte stip onderscheiden. Hij schoot den pijl af en zag een ooievaar
in de lochting vallen.
Klaas was er droef om, maar Soetkin nog meer, en zij riep:
--Nu hebt gij den vogel Gods gedood!
Zij nam toen den ooievaar en zag dat hij maar aan den vleugel gewond
was; zij ging ongel halen en sprak, terwijl ze zijne wonde vermaakte:
--Ooievaar lief, 't is niet behendig voor u, die geerne gezien wordt,
van in de lucht te zweven als een steekvogel, die gehaat wordt. Aldus
treffen de pijlen des volks soms den verkeerden man. Hebt gij zeer aan
uwen vleugel, arme ooievaar, dat gij mij zoo gewillig laat begaan? Hoe
weet gij dat onze handen handen van vrienden zijn?
Als de ooievaar genezen was, kreeg hij alles te eten wat hem lustte;
doch liefst at hij de visch, die Klaas voor hem in de vaart ging
vangen. En telkens dat de vogel Gods hem zag komen, opende hij gretig
den bek.
Hij volgde Klaas als een hondje, maar liefst bleef hij in de keuken,
alwaar hij zijne maag warmde en met den snavel op Soetkin sloeg,
terwijl zij het noenmaal bereidde, als om heur te vragen:
--Is er niets bij voor mij?
En 't was aardig dien ernstigen geluksbode op zijne lange pooten de
hut te zien rondloopen.
LI.
Maar de slechte dagen waren teruggekomen: droevig wrocht Klaas alleen
op zijn akker, want er was geen werk voor hen beiden. Soetkin bleef in
de stulp en bereidde op allerhande manieren de boonen, hun dagelijksch
maal, om Klaas' eetlust te streelen. En zij zong en zij lachte, opdat
hij heure droefheid niet merken zou. De ooievaar stond bij heur,
op één poot en met den bek in de pluimen.
Een man te peerd hield voor hunne woning stil; hij was heel in 't
zwart gekleed en had een mager en droevig gezicht.
--Is hier iemand thuis? vroeg hij.
--God zegene Uwe Droefgeestigheid, antwoordde Soetkin; ben ik dan
een schimme, dat gij mij vraagt of iemand thuis is?
--Waar is uw vader? vroeg de ruiter.
--Als mijn vader den naam draagt van Klaas, is hij ginder, antwoordde
Soetkin, en bezig met koren te zaaien.
De ruiter ging weg, en Soetkin toog ook henen vol droefheid, want
voor de zesde reize moest ze, zonder geld, brood bij den bakker gaan
halen. En toen ze met ledige handen terugkwam, was zij versteld Klaas
triomfantelijk te zien terugkomen op het peerd van den zwarten man, die
te voet naast hem ging en het dier bij den toom hield. Klaas hield vol
trotschheid in de hand een lederen tassche, dewelke goed gevuld scheen.
Toen hij van 't peerd steeg, omhelsde hij den man en klopte hem
vervolgens vriendelijk op den schouder.
--Leve mijn broeder Judocus, de goede heremijt! riep hij uit, terwijl
hij de tassche deed rinkelen. God beware hem in vreugd, in vet en in
gezondheid. 't Is Judocus vol zegen, Judocus vol overvloed, Judocus
met zijne vette soep! De ooievaar heeft geenszins gelogen!
En hij legde de tassche op de tafel. Jammerend sprak Soetkin toen:
--Man, wij hebben geen eten vandaag: de bakker heeft mij brood
geweigerd.
Brood? sprak Klaas, de tassche openend en goudstukken op de tafel
gietend, brood? Daar is brood, boter, vleesch, wijn, bier! Daar zijn
hespen, mergpijpen, reigerpastijen, ortolanen, ganzen, krakelingen,
daar is ambrozijn, lijk bij de groote heeren! daar is bier met tonnen
en wijn met vaten! Gestraft wordt de bakker, want wij zullen bij hem
niets meer koopen.
--Maar man, sprak Soetkin verbaasd.
--Nu luister, sprak Klaas, en wees verblijd. Katelijne, in stee
van in 't markgraafschap Antwerpen hare ballingschap uit te doen,
is vergezelschapt door Nele, te voet naar Meiborg gegaan. Daar heeft
Nele tot mijn broeder Judocus gezegd, dat wij ondanks onzen harden
arbeid, veelal in armoe verkeeren. En naarvolgens die goede bode mij
zooeven gezegd heeft--en Klaas wees naar den zwarten ruiter--heeft
Judocus den heiligen Roomschen godsdienst verlaten, om de Luthersche
ketterije aan te hangen.
De zwarte man sprak:
--Ketters zijn zij, die de Groote Hoer volgen. Want de Paus vergeet
zijne plichten en drijft handel in de heilige zaken.
--Stil! zei Soetkin, spreek niet zoo luide, gij zoudt ons gedrieën
op den brandstapel brengen!
--Dus, vervolgde Klaas, Judocus heeft aan dezen braven bode gezegd,
aangezien hij strijden ging onder de troepen van Frederik van Saksen,
wien hij vijftig goed gewapende mannen bezorgde, hij zooveel geld
niet van noode had, want dat het, bij rampspoed, toch zou worden
gestolen door een of anderen landsknecht. Breng dus, zoo sprak hij,
met mijnen zegen, die zevenhonderd karolusgulden aan Klaas, mijnen
broeder en zeg hem dat hij goed leve en het heil zijner ziel gedenke.
--Ja, sprak de ruiter, want 't is tijd: God geeft een ieder naar zijne
werken en handelt met een iegelijk volgens de verdiensten zijns levens.
--Heer, sprak Klaas, 't zal mij ondertusschen toch niet verboden
zijn mij in de goede tijding te verblijden? Verweerdig u hier te
blijven. Om uwe boodschap te vieren, zullen wij eten heerlijke pensen,
menigvuldige karbonaden, een hammetje dat daar even zoo rond en zoo
lekker bij den spekslager lag, dat mijne tanden wel een voet lang
uit mijnen mond kwamen.
--Laas! sprak de man, alleen de goddeloozen denken aan genuchten,
terwijl de blikken des Heeren op hen zijn gevestigd.
--Nu, bode, sprak Klaas, wilt gij met ons eten en drinken of niet?
De man antwoordde:
--De geloovigen zullen hunne zielen aan de aardsche genoegens mogen
wijden, als de Babylonische Hoer ten gronde zal liggen!
Daar Klaas en Soetkin een kruis sloegen, wilde hij heengaan.
Klaas sprak tot hem:
--Zoo het U behaagt aldus met een slecht onthaal te vertrekken,
geef dan den vredekus aan mijn broeder Judocus en waak over hem in
't gevecht.
--Ik zal het doen, sprak de man.
En hij toog henen, terwijl Soetkin eten ging halen om dit uit de
lucht gevallen fortuin te vieren. Dien avond kreeg de ooievaar twee
grondelingen en een kabeljauwskop.
De mare verspreidde zich weldra te Damme, dat de arme Klaas, door
het toedoen van zijn broeder Judocus, de rijke Klaas was geworden. En
de deken zei, dat Katelijne zeker Judocus betooverd had, daar Klaas
van hem een groote somme gelds had gekregen en dat hij niet eens een
kleedje aan Onze-Lieve-Vrouw had geofferd.
Klaas en Soetkin waren gelukkig; Klaas wrocht op het veld of verkocht
zijne kolen, en Soetkin bleef de wakkere huisvrouw.
Maar Soetkin, altoos droefgeestig, zocht steeds, met de oogen, heuren
zoon Uilenspiegel op de wegen.
En alle drie smaakten het geluk, dat God hun zond, in afwachting van
hetgeen de menschen hun zouden jonnen.
LII.
Keizer Karel ontving dien dag uit Engeland een brief, in denwelken
zijn zoon hem schreef:
"Heer en Vader,
"Het mishaagt mij grootelijks te moeten leven in een land, waar
de gevloekte ketteren vermenigvuldigen als vlooien, rupsen en
sprinkhanen. Het vuur en het zweerd zouden niet te veel zijn om ze
te rukken van den stam des levendmakenden booms die onze Moeder de
Heilige Kerk is. Alsof mijn leed nog niet voldoende ware, beschouwen
mijne onderdanen mij niet als een koning, maar als den echtgenoot
van hunne koningin, die zonder haar geenerlei gezag zou hebben. Zij
spotten met mij, zeggende in kwaadwillige boekskens, waarvan niemand
den schrijver of drukker kan vinden, dat de Paus mij betaalt om
stoornis en verderf te brengen in het koninkrijk, door ketteren te
hangen en te branden en, zoo ik een dringende schatting opleggen
wil--want meermaals laten zij mij met opzet zonder geld--antwoorden
zij in boosaardige paskwils, dat ik er maar te vragen heb aan Satan,
voor denwelken ik werk. Die van 't Parlement bieden mij, uit vreeze,
hoogst nederig hunne verontschuldiging aan, maar zij geven toch niets.
"Doch de muren van Londen zijn bedekt met opschriften, waarin ik
voorgesteld word als een vadermoorder, gereed om Uwe Majesteit te
treffen, om van hem te erven.
"Maar gij weet, Heer en Vader dat onaangezien rechtmatigen trots,
ik aan Uwe Majesteit nog lange en glorierijke dagen wensch.
"Ook verspreiden zij in de stad eene prent, geëtst op koper,
waarop ik afgebeeld word staande bij eene klavecimbel, in dewelke
katten opgesloten zijn, die met hare pooten op de snaren slaan
en wier steerten steken uit ronde gaten, waaraan zij met ijzeren
roeden vastgemaakt zijn. Een man, die ben ik, verbrandt de steerten
met een gloeiend ijzer, om de dieren met de pooten op de toetsen
te doen slaan en erbarmlijk te doen kermen. Ik ben afgebeeld zoo
wanstaltig en met zulken grijnslach, dat ik mij niet wil bezien. En
gij weet, Heer en Vader, of ik mij ooit aan zulk onheilig vermaak
overleverde. Ongetwijfeld deed ik wel eens, voor mijn pleizier,
katten mauwen, doch ik lachte niet. Als echte muitmakers, rekenen
zij mij dit alles als eene misdaad aan, hoewel de dieren geene ziel
hebben, en een iegelijk, en inzonderheid vorstelijke personen, zich
van hen mag bedienen tot nut en verzet. Maar in Engeland is men zoo
verzot op dieren, dat men ze beter behandelt dan de dienstknechten;
stallen en hondehokken zijn hier paleizen en hier zijn heeren, die
in den stal bij hun peerd slapen.
"Daarenboven is mijne gade en koningin onvruchtbaar. Om mij te
beleedigen zeggen ze, dat ik, niet zij--die jaloersch, onhandelbaar,
en bovenmate minneziek blijft--daarvan de schuld is. Mijnheer en Vader,
alle dagen bid ik deemoedig Onzen Heere, dat Hij mij Zijne genade
schenke, in de hoop dat Hij mij een anderen troon geve, al was het
bij de Turken, in afwachting van dien tot denwelken eenmaal geroepen
zal worden de zoon Uwer Allerglorierijkste en Allerzegevierendste
Majesteit.
"Ondertekend: Philippus."
De keizer antwoordde als volgt:
"Mijnheer en Zoon,
"Uwe vijanden zijn groot, ik betwist het geenszins, doch tracht
zonder grammoedigheid een schitterender kroon te verbeiden. Reeds
meermalen heb ik het voornemen uitgedrukt, mij terug te trekken uit
de Nederlanden en uit mijne andere bezittingen, want ik voel dat ik,
oud en jichtig als ik word, niet meer zal kunnen wederstaan aan Hendrik
van Frankrijk, den tweeden van dien naam, want de Fortuin lacht steeds
den jongeren toe. Verlies ook niet uit het oog, dat gij, meester van
Engeland, door uwe macht, Frankrijk, onzen vijand, kwetst en vernedert.
"Ik werd deerlijk verslagen vóór Metz, alwaar ik veertig duizend man
verloor; ik moest vluchten voor den koning van Saksen. Als God mij
door Zijne Goedertierenheid in mijn vroegere kracht en macht niet
wil herstellen, ben ik van zins, Mijnheer en Zoon, U mijne rijken af
te staan.
"Heb dus geduld en doe ondertusschen uwen plicht tegen de ketterijen,
van dewelke gij niemand moet sparen, noch mannen, noch vrouwlieden,
noch kinderen, want mij is niet zonder leed ter kennis gekomen,
dat Mevrouw de koninginne hun dikwijls genade wil schenken.
"Uw verkleefde vader,
Onderteekend: Karel."
LIII.
Daar Uilenspiegel lang, zeer lang gegaan had, waren zijne voeten tot
bloedens toe gekwetst. Doch in het bisdom Mentz ontmoette hij eenen
wagen met pelgrims, die hem naar Rome bracht.
Toen hij in die stad kwam en uit den wagen stapte, zag hij aan de
poort eener afspanning een poezele vrouwe staan, die hem toelachte.
Heur minnelijk gezichtje beviel hem ten volle.
--Weerdin, sprak hij, wilt gij een reizenden pelgrim herbergen, die,
met zonden overladen, den Heiligen Vader om genade komt smeeken?
--Wij herbergen al degenen, die betalen.
--Ik heb honderd dukaten in mijne tassche, antwoordde Uilenspiegel,
die er maar éénen had, en met u wil ik den eersten verteren; laat
ons een bottel ouden Roomschen wijn drinken.
--De wijn is niet duur in deze heilige stede, sprak zij; kom binnen
en drink voor een soldo.
Zij dronken samen lang en ledigden, onder vriendelijk gekeuvel,
zulke menigte flesschen, dat de weerdin aan heure meid zeggen moest
de klanten in heure plaats te gerieven, terwijl zij en Uilenspiegel
in een marmeren achterkamer zaten, waar het koel was als in den winter.
Heur hoofd op zijn schouder leunend, vroeg zij hem wie hij was.
--Ik ben messire van Geenland, grave van Nergensthuis heere van
Vastendonk, en 'k heb te Damme, dat mijne geboorteplaats is, vijf en
twintig bunders maneschijn.
--Waar ligt dat land? vroeg de weerdin, uit Uilenspiegel's beker
drinkend.
--'t Is een land, sprak hij, waar men stoute verbeelding, onzinnige
verwachtingen en ijdele beloften zaait; een land, waar gij niet
vandaan zijt, met uwe lichtbruine huid, met uwe oogen die flonkeren
als perelen; ze zijn van de kleur van de zonne, die goudbruine
lokken; 't is het erfdeel van Venus, die gevleesde schouderen, die
goddelijke borsten, die ronde armen, die fijne handjes. Willen wij
samen avondmalen?
--Schoone pelgrim uit Vlaanderen, sprak zij, wat komt gij hier doen?
--Den paus spreken, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Laas! sprak zij, den paus spreken! Ik, die hier vandaan ben, heb
het nog nooit gekunnen.
--Ik zal het kunnen, sprak Uilenspiegel.
--Maar, sprak zij, weet gij waar hij gaat, hoe hij is, en kent gij
zijne levenswijze?
--Onderweg zegde men mij, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, dat hij Julius de
derde heet, dat hij ontuchtig, lichtzinnig is, dat hij goed klapt en
snedig antwoordt. Men zei ook mij, dat hij een ongemeene vriendschap
opgevat heeft voor een zwarten, vuilen bedelaar, die met een aapje
de aalmoes vroeg, dat hij hem tot kardinaal gemaakt heeft en dat hij
ziek is als hij hem een dag niet ziet.
--Drink, sprak zij, en spreek niet zoo luide.
--Men zei ook, vervolgde Uilenspiegel, dat hij eens vloekte als een
soldenier, toen hij een kouden pauw niet terugvond, dien hij had doen
wegzetten voor zijn avondmaal, en dat hij sprak: Ik, de stadhouder
Gods, mag wel vloeken om een pauw, wanneer mijn meester grammoedig
om eenen appel was! Gij ziet liefste, dat ik den paus ken en weet
wie hij is.
--Laas! zegde zij, spreek daarvan aan anderen niet. Maar gij zult
hem niet zien.
--Ik zal hem spreken, zei Uilenspiegel.
--Als gij dát kunt, betaal ik U honderd florijnen.
--Ik heb ze gewonnen! sprak Uilenspiegel.
Hoewel zijne beenen vermoeid waren, doorliep hij 's anderen daags
de stad en vernam hij, dat de paus dien dag de misse zou lezen in de
kerk van San Giovanni in Laterano. Uilenspiegel toog er henen, ging
zoo dicht bij den paus staan als hij kon, en telkens dat de paus den
kelk of de hostie ophief, keerde Uilenspiegel den rug naar het autaar.
De paus was bijgestaan door een schelmschen, zwaarlijvigen kardinaal,
die, met een aapje op den schouder, het volk het sacrament gaf,
met menigvuldige ontuchtige gebaren daarbij. Hij deed den paus de
handelwijze van Uilenspiegel kennen, en als de misse gedaan was,
kwamen vier groote pijkeniers zich meester maken van den pelgrim.
--Van welk geloove zijt gij? vroeg hem de paus.
--Van hetzelfde als mijne hospita, Zeer Heilige Vader, antwoordde
Uilenspiegel.
De paus ontbood de vrouwe.
--Wat gelooft gij? vroeg hij haar.
--Alles wat Uwe Heiligheid gelooft, antwoordde zij.
--En ik van 's gelijken, sprak Uilenspiegel.
De paus vroeg hem, waarom hij den rug naar het autaar gekeerd had.
--Ik voelde mij onweerdig het te aanschouwen, antwoordde Uilenspiegel
deemoedig.
--Zijt gij pelgrim? vroeg hem de paus.
--Ja, sprak hij, en 'k kom uit Vlaanderen om vergiffenis voor mijne
zonden te vragen.
De paus zegende hem en Uilenspiegel ging henen met de weerdin, die
hem honderd florijnen telde. Met de tassche gevuld, verliet hij Rome
om naar Vlaanderenland terug te keeren.
Maar zeven dukaten moest hij betalen voor het perkament, op hetwelk
zijne vergiffenis geschreven stond.
LIV.
Te dien tijde kwamen twee premonstratenzer broeders te Damme aflaten
verkoopen. Boven hunne monnikspij, droegen zij een schoon fijn hemde,
met kant bezet.
Aan de deur der kerke, bij helder weder, en onder 't portaal als het
regenachtig was, hingen zij hun tarief uit; daarin gaven zij voor zes
duiten, voor een oortje, voor een half pond parisis, voor zeven, voor
twaalf karolusgulden, honderd, tweehonderd, driehonderd, vierhonderd
jaar aflaat, en, al naarvolgens de prijzen, halven aflaat en vollen
aflaat en de vergiffenis voor de afschuwelijkste schelmstukken, ja
zelfs voor het koesteren van begeerten ten opzichte van de Heilige
Maagd. Maar dát kostte zeventien gulden.
Aan de klanten die betaalden, stelden zij kleine stukjes perkament
ter hand, op dewelke het cijfer van de jaren aflaat geschreven was. En
daaronder stond het opschrift:
      Is er iemand die niet en wil zijn
        Gebraeden ofte geroosterd fijn,
      Bij duizend jaer in 't vaegevuer,
    Of in de Helle voor allen duer,
      Hij coope de aflaten maer
      De gratiën en de kwijtscheldingen te gaer
        Voor ietswat geld ende goed:
      God hem dan het loonen moet.
En er kwamen koopers van tien uren in 't ronde.
Een van de goede broeders preekte dikwijls voor het volk; hij had
roode kaken en een driedubbele kin.
--Ongelukkige! sprak hij, een of anderen zijner toehoorders beziende;
ongelukkige! daar zijt gij in de helle! Het vuur verbrandt u
wreedelijk: men legt u te koken in een ketel vol vet, in denwelken
men oliekoekjes voor Astarte bakt; gij zijt niets meer dan eene worst
in Lucifer's panne, een hamelbout in die van Gielgirot, den grooten
duivel, want men snijdt u eerst aan stukken! Zie nu dien grooten
zondaar, die de aflaten versmaadde; zie dien schotel stoverije: hij
is 't, hij is 't, zijn goddeloos lichaam, zijn vermaledijd lichaam
is vaneengekookt tot eene brij. En met welke saus! sulfer, pek en
teer! En al die arme zondaren worden alzoo opgegeten om opnieuw tot
hunne smerte in 't leven te komen. En 't is een gedurig geween en
tandengeknars. Ontferm U onzer, genadige God! Ja, daar ligt gij in de
helle, arme verdoemde, al die smerten te lijden. Zoo men voor u maar
éénen denier gaf, dan zoudt gij bereids verlichting aan de rechterhand
gevoelen; met nog een halven denier bij, waren uwe twee handen uit
het vuur. Maar de rest van uw lichaam? Voor één gulden slechts, zou
de dauw des aflaats op u nedervallen. O, verkwikkende koelte! En in
tien dagen, in honderd dagen, in duizend jaar, al naar gelang dat men
betaalt, geen gebraad, geen oliekoekje, geen stoverije meer! En als
't voor u niet is, zondaar, liggen er soms geen vrienden of magen
van u, geene gade of geen liefje in de gruwelijke diepte des vuurs?
En dit zeggende, stiet de monnik met den elleboog tegen den broeder,
die met een zilveren schotel naast hem stond. En op dat teeken sloeg
de broeder de oogen neer en schudde devotelijk den schotel om het
geld bij te roepen.
... Hebt gij, vervolgde de monnik, hebt gij in het helsche vuur
soms geen zoon, geene dochter, geen kindje, dat gij lief hadt? Zij
schreeuwen, zij weenen, zij roepen U. Zoudt gij doof blijven voor hun
bange klachte? Dat kunt gij niet; uw hert van ijs gaat smelten, maar
dat zal u een karolus kosten. En kijk, bij den klank van dien karolus
op dit verachtelijk metaal ... (de andere monnik schudde nogmaals
zijn schotel) maakt zich eene ruimte in het vuur, en stijgt de arme
ziele tot aan den mond van eenen vuurberg. Daar is zij in de versche,
in de vrije lucht! Waar zijn de smerten des vuurs? De zee is nabij,
de arme ziele werpt er zich in, zij zwemt op den rug, op den buik, op
de golven. Hoor, hoe zij schreeuwt van vreugde, zie, hoe zij duikelt
in 't water! De engelen bezien haar en zijn gelukkig. Zij wachten
heur, maar zij kan uit het water niet weg, zoo goed, zoo koel is het
daar. Zij weet niet, de arme ziele, dat daarboven heerlijke geurige
baden heur wachten, in dewelke groote stukken kandijsuiker drijven,
en die koel zijn als ijs. Daar komt een haai: zij vreest hem niet. Zij
klimt op zijnen rug, maar hij voelt heur niet; zij wil met hem in
't diepste der zee dringen. Zij gaat er de zeenimfen groeten, die
waterzooi eten in koralen ketels en versche oesters in perelmoeren
tellooren. En zij wordt goed ontvangen, onthaald en gevierd; de engelen
roepen heur altijd omhoog. Gansch verkwikt, gelukkig, begint zij te
zingen als een leeuwerik en vliegt zij naar 't hoogste der hemelen,
alwaar God glorierijk op Zijnen troon is gezeten. Zij vindt daar al
heure vrienden en magen terug, behalve diegenen, die de aflaten en
Onze Moeder de Heilige Kerke versmaadden en branden in het diepste
der helle. En dat voor altijd, altijd, altijd, in de eeuwigheid der
eeuwigheden. Maar de andere ziele, zij is bij den Heere; zij verkwikt
zich in welriekende baden en knabbelt kandijsuiker. Koopt aflaten,
mijne broeders: men heeft er tegen alle prijzen, tegen dukaten,
tegen gouden florijnen, Engelsche sovereings! Kopergeld wordt niet
versmaad. Koopt! koopt! alhier is de heilige winkel; armen en rijken
worden gediend, maar krediet geeft men niet, mijne broeders, want
koopen zonder klinkende munt is eene misdaad in de oogen van den Heer."
De broeder, die niet preekte, rammelde met den schotel. Guldens,
dukaten, lammeren, oortjes, stuivers en deniers vielen er in als
hagelsteenen.
Klaas, die nu geld had, betaalde een gulden voor tienduizend jaar
aflaat. De monniken gaven hem daarvoor een stuksken perkament.
Eindelijk ziende, dat er in Damme niemand overbleef dan de
hertevreters, die geen aflaten zouden koopen, trokken de beide broeders
naar Heist.
LV.
Gekleed met zijne pelgrimspij en met eene absolutie in regel op zak,
verliet Uilenspiegel de heilige stede. Hij ging recht voor zich en
kwam te Bamberg, waar de smakelijkste groenten der wereld zijn.
Hij kwam in eene afspanning, waar een vroolijke weerdinne hem vroeg:
--Jonge meester, wilt gij eten voor uw geld?
--Ja, sprak Uilenspiegel. Maar voor hoeveel eet men hier?
De hospita sprak:
--Aan de tafel der heeren eet men voor zes gulden; aan de tafel der
poorters voor vier, en aan de huistafel voor twee.
--Hoe meer, hoe liever! antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
Hij ging dus aan de tafel der heeren zitten. Als hij wel zijne bekomst
en zijn maal met Rijnwijn begoten had, sprak hij tot de weerdin:
--Bazin, ik heb goed gegeten voor mijn geld: geef mij mijne zes gulden.
De weerdinne sprak:
--'t Is om te lachen, zeker! Betaal mij maar gauw!
--Liefste bazinne, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, gij ziet er geen slechte
betaalster uit; integendeel, gij ziet er zoo eerlijk, zoo rechtschapen
uit, dat gij mij nog liever achttien gulden zoudt geven, dan mij de
zes te weigeren die gij mij schuldig zijt. Wat schoone oogen! 't is
de zonne, die mij bestraalt, die mijne liefde hooger doet schieten dan
't hondsgras in een verlaten kluis.
De weerdinne sprak:
--Ik heb geen zaken noch met uwe liefde noch met uw hondsgras, betaal
mij en trek op!
--Optrekken, sprak Uilenspiegel, en u niet meer zien. 'k Zei nog
liever vaarwel aan 't leven. Bazinne, zoete bazinne, ik, arme pelgrim,
pleeg niet voor zes gulden te eten; ik heb mij vol gepropt en straks
laat ik de tong hangen als een hond in de zonne: wil mij betalen, ik
verdiende eerlijk de zes gulden door het lastige werk mijner tanden;
geef ze mij, en 'k zal u streelen, u zoenen, u kussen, met meer vuur
dan wel zeven en twintig minnaars te zamen.
--Zoo spreekt gij voor 't geld, antwoordde zij.
--Moet ik u voor niets opeten? vroeg hij.
--Neen, sprak zij, hem afwerend.
--Ah! zuchtte hij, steeds naderend, uwe huid is als room zoo zacht,
uw haar als gebraden fazant, en uwe lippen als rijpe kersen! Maar
zijn er lekkerder kersen dan gij?
--Ik vind het goed, leelijke stouterik, sprak zij glimlachend, mij op
den koop toe nog zes gulden te vragen! Wees tevreden dat ik u eten gaf,
zonder betaling te eischen.
--Wist gij, sprak Uilenspiegel, hoeveel plaats er nog is!
--Vertrek, sprak de hospita, eer mijn man komt!
--Zie, sprak Uilenspiegel, ik zal een redelijke schuldeischer zijn,
geef mij slechts één gulden voor den dorst, die zal komen.
--Daar, stouterik, sprak zij.
En zij gaf hem een gulden.
--Mag ik nog terugkomen? vroeg Uilenspiegel.
--Wilt gij wel heengaan! sprak zij.
--Wél heengaan, zei Uilenspiegel, dat ware naar u toe gaan, maar 't
is een slecht heengaan, die schoone oogen te moeten verlaten. Als ge
mij wilt houden, zal ik alle dagen maar voor één gulden eten....
--Moet ik een stok nemen?
--Wilt gij den mijnen? antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
Zij lachte, maar hij moest henengaan.
LVI.
Rond dien tijd kwam Lamme Goedzak weder te Damme wonen, mits het land
van Luik niet meer rustig was, ter oorzake van de ketterij. Zijne
vrouw kwam volgeerne mede, omdat de Luikenaars, spotters van nature,
lachten met Lamme's lamlendigheid.
Lamme ging dikwijls bij Klaas, die sedert hij geërfd had, veel in de
taveerne den Blauwen Toren verbleef, alwaar hij eene tafel gekozen had
voor zich zelven en zijne gezellen. Aan de naburige tafel zat een man
profijtelijk zijn kapperken te drinken; 't was Judocus Grijpstuiver,
de gierige deken der vischverkoopers, die niets dan haring at en
meer van zijn geld hield dan van zijner ziele zaligheid. Klaas droeg
in zijn tassche het stuk perkament, op hetwelk zijn aflaat van tien
duizend jaar geschreven stond.
Op een avond dat hij met Lamme Goedzak, Jan van Roosebeke en Mathijs
van Assche in den Blauwen Toren zat, en Judocus Grijpstuiver er ook
was, ging Klaas lustig aan 't drinken; Jan van Roosebeke zegde tot hem:
--'t Is zonde Gods van zoo te drinken!
Klaas antwoordde:
--Voor elk pintje te veel brandt men maar een halven dag. En 'k heb
tienduizend jaar aflaat in mijn tassche. Wie wil er honderd jaar,
om zonder vrees voor de pijnen der hel, den god Bacchus te dienen?
Allen riepen:
--Hoeveel vraagt gij er voor?
--Eene pinte, antwoordde Klaas, maar honderd vijftig jaar geef ik
voor eene portie konijn.
En een ieder kwam bij en betaalde aan Klaas pinten, kuite en
muskens, hesp en konijn, en voor een ieder sneed hij een stuksken
perkament. Doch 't was niet Klaas die alles at en dronk, maar wel
Lamme Goedzak, dewelke at dat hij oogenschijnlijk opzwol, terwijl
Klaas met zijne waar de taveerne rondging.
Grijpstuiver keerde zijn schrokkig gezicht naar hem.
--Kunt gij tien dagen missen? vroeg hij.
--Neen, antwoordde Klaas, dat is moeilijk om passen.
Iedereen lachte, en Grijpstuiver kropte zijne woede op.
Toen trok Klaas naar zijne hut, gevolgd door Lamme, die stapte alsof
hij wollen beenen aan zijn lijf had.
LVII.
Rond het einde van heur derde jaar ballingschap, keerde Katelijne te
Damme terug naar heur huis. En gedurig sprak zij uitzinnig: "Vuur op
het hoofd, de ziele klopt, maakt een gat, zij wil er uit". En altijd
vluchtte zij weg, bij het zien van ossen en schapen. En zij zette
zich neer op de bank onder de linden achter heure hut, en schudde
het hoofd, terwijl zij, zonder ze te herkennen, die van Damme bekeek,
dewelke tot elkander lispten: "Daar is de zottinne".
Doch reizend over velden en wegen, zag Uilenspiegel een ezel, getuigd
met leder en koperen nagelen, en den kop versierd met roodwollen
kwasten en kwispels.
Eenige oude wijven stonden rond den ezel en zeiden, allen te gelijk
sprekend: "Niemand mag hem vastnemen; 't is het afgrijselijke rijbeest
van den grooten toovenaar, den baron von Raiz, die levend verbrand
werd, om acht kinderen aan den duivel geofferd te hebben.--Zoo rap is
hij gevlucht, dat niemand hem krijgen kon; Satan houdt de hand boven
zijnen kop.--Want terwijl hij, vermoeid op den weg, een oogenblik
stilstond om adem te halen, zijn de stadsserjanten gekomen om hem te
pakken, maar hij balkte en sloeg zoo geweldig met zijne achterpooten,
dat zij niet naderen dorsten.--En 't is niet 't gebalk van een ezel,
maar 't gebalk van een duivel.--Men heeft hem dus distelen laten
eten zonder hem voor de vierschaar te dagen of als toovenaar levend
te branden?--Die mannen, die mannen, zij hebben geen greintje moed
in hun lijf".
Niettegenstaande al deze schoone reden, namen allen schreeuwend de
vlucht, zoodra de ezel de ooren spitste of met den steert zijne zijden
sloeg; en tienmaal kwamen zij aldus nader al kakelend en snaterend,
om tienmaal weder de vlucht te nemen.
Maar Uilenspiegel zag haar van verre en sprak lachend tot zich zelven:
--Zie ze parlesanten! Hoe ouder ze zijn, hoe meer ze babbelen: de
jongeren zitten meer met minnarijen in 't hoofd.
Den ezel beziende, ging hij voort:
--Dat betooverde grauwtje staat goed op zijne pooten, dunkt mij;
ik ga het ergens berijden of verkoopen.
Zonder een woord te spreken, kocht hij een maatje haver, hetwelk
hij den ezel vóór zette. Hij sprong vervolgens gezwind op den rug
van het dier, nam den teugel vast, keerde zich naar het Noorden,
het Oosten en het Westen en zegende de oude wijven. Dezen, van schrik
bevangen, vielen op de knieën, en 's avonds vertelden zij aan den hoek
van den heerd, dat een engel verschenen was met een vilten hoed met
fazanteveeren en heur allen gezegend had en dat hij, door bijzondere
gunste van God, weggereden was op den ezel des toovenaars.
En Uilenspiegel ging met zijn ezel te midden van malsche beemden, waar
peerden huppelden, en koeien en veerzen loom in de zonne herkauwden.
En hij heette hem Jef.
De ezel was blijven staan en deed zich deugd aan de distelen. Somwijlen
nochtans, huiverde hij over gansch zijne huid en sloeg hij met den
steert op zijne zijden om de vraatzuchtige horzels te verdrijven die,
evenals hij, wilden eten, doch van zijn vleesch en zijn bloed.
Uilenspiegel, wiens maag naar eten riep, was weemoedig en sprak:
--Gij zoudt wel gelukkig zijn, mijnheer de ezel, zoo gij kondt blijven
smullen zonder dat iemand u stoort en u herinneren komt dat gij
sterfelijk zijt, dat wil zeggen geboren om te lijden en te verduren.
... Evenals gij, vervolgde hij, heeft de man met de Heilige Muil zijne
horzel en dat is mijnheer Luther; en Zijne Genadige Majesteit Karel
heeft ook de zijne, dat is messire Frans de eerste, de koning met
zijn langen neus en zijn nog langeren degen. Ik, arme zwerveling,
mag dus ook mijne horzel wel hebben, mijnheer de ezel. Laas! in
al mijne zakken zijn gaten, en langs de gaten schaveelen dukaten,
guldens en daalders, gelijk een legioen muizen die vluchten voor den
klauw eener kat. Ik weet niet waarom het geld van mij niet houdt,
ik houde nochtans zooveel van het geld. 't Is eene leugen, dat de
Fortuin eene vrouw is, want zij bemint maar de oude gierigaards, die
haar vrekkig sluiten in kisten, in koffers, in zakken, en haar nooit
met het tipje van heur gouden neusje aan 't venster laten komen. Dat
is de horzel die mij bijt en mij knaagt, die mij kittelt zonder mij
te doen lachen. Maar gij luistert niet, mijnheer de ezel, gij denkt
maar aan eten. Ha! buikvuller, uwe lange ooren blijven doof voor den
kreet mijner ledige maag. Aanhoor mij, ik wil het!
En hij zweepte hem. De ezel begon te balken.
--Laat ons gaan, nu gij gezongen hebt, sprak Uilenspiegel.
Maar de ezel verroerde zich niet meer dan een paal en scheen van zins
al die distelen van den weg tot de laatste naar binnen te jagen. En
hij sloeg er geen enkele over.
Dat ziende, steeg Uilenspiegel af; hij sneed een bussel distelen,
stak die onder den bek van den ezel en mende dezen bij den neus tot
op het grondgebied van den landgraaf van Hessen.
--Mijnheer de ezel, sprak Uilenspiegel onderweg, gij loopt achter
mijn bos distelen en versmaadt de lekkere planten waarmede de lange
weg volstaat. Gij zijt lijk de mannen die loopen achter eenen bos
roem, eenen bos gewin, eenen bos liefde, dien de Geluksgodin onder
hunnen neus steekt. Op het einde van den weg zien zij, gelijk gij,
dat de nagejaagde buit weinig weerde heeft, terwijl zij onderweg èn
rust èn werk èn gezondheid lieten.
Aldus met zijn ezel klappend, bereikte Uilenspiegel het kasteel van
den landgraaf.
Twee kapiteins der boogschutters speelden op de trap met dobbelsteenen.
Een hunner, ros van haar en groot van gestalte, bezag Uilenspiegel,
die zediglijk op Jef zat en hen aankeek.
--Wat wilt gij, met uwe hongerige en reizende tronie? sprak hij.
--'k Heb inderdaad honger, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, en reize geenszins
voor mijn vermaak.
--Zoo gij honger hebt, sprak de kapitein, kunt gij met den hals de
koorde opeten, die zwiert aan de eerste galge die gij ontmoet.
--Heer kapitein, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, als gij mij de schoone gouden
koorde geeft die rond uwen hoed ligt, zal ik mij met de tanden gaan
ophangen aan die vette hesp, die ginder bij dien spekslachter zwiert.
--Van waar komt gij? vroeg de kapitein.
--Uit Vlaanderen, was 't antwoord van Uilenspiegel.
--Wat wilt gij?
--Aan Zijne Landgrafelijke Hoogheid eene schilderij van mijne hand
toonen.
--Kom binnen, als gij een schilder en van Vlaanderen zijt, sprak de
kapitein, ik zal u bij mijnen meester brengen.
Toen Uilenspiegel bij den landgraaf was, groette hij hem drie reizen
en nog meer.
--Uwe Hoogheid, sprak hij, verweerdige mij aan zijne edele voeten eene
schilderij neder te leggen, die ik voor hem maakte, en op dewelke
ik het konterfeitsel verbeeldde van de Allerheiligste Maagd Maria,
in haren vorstelijken dos.
... Die schilderij zal misschien de eer hebben Uwe Hoogheid te
bevallen, vervolgde hij, in welk geval ik mij vermete te hopen het
ambt te verkrijgen van schilder Uwer Grootmoedigheid.
De landgraaf bezag het doek, dat goed gemaald was, en sprak:
--Gij zult onze schilder zijn; neem plaats in dien zetel.
En Uilenspiegel kuste hem op beide wangen en nam plaats in den zetel.
--Gij ziet er niet rijk uit, sprak de landgraaf.
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Inderdaad sire; Jef, mijn ezel kon distelen eten, doch drie dagen
reeds leef ik van ellende en eet ik rook van hope.
--Straks krijgt gij beters, sprak de landgraaf lachend, maar waar is
uw ezel?
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Ik liet hem op de Groote Markt, rechtover 't kasteel Uwer Genade;
ik ware gelukkig zoo Jef dezen nacht op stal was.
De edele landgraaf gebood dadelijk aan een zijner schildknapen den
ezel van Uilenspiegel als zijn eigen beest te behandelen.
Weldra kwam het uur des avondmaals, dat een recht festijn was. En de
spijzen rookten op tafel, en de wijn liep als een stroom door de kelen.
Uilenspiegel en de landgraaf werden zoo rood als hanen. Uilenspiegel
was vol vreugd, maar de landgraaf bleef nadenkend.
--Schilder, sprak hij eensklaps, gij zult mijn portret moeten maken,
want 't is een groote voldoening voor een sterfelijken vorst, aan
zijne nazaten de geheugenis zijner trekken te laten.
--Sire, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, uw wensch is mijn wil, maar 't
schijnt mij, nietsweerdige, dat uwe Edelheid in de toekomende eeuwen
niet veel genoegen zal smaken, zoo alleene op het doek te staan. Hij
moet vergezelschapt wezen door zijne adellijke gemalinne, mevrouw de
Landgravin, door zijne edelvrouwen en heeren, door zijne dapperste
kapiteins, te midden waarvan zijne Hoogheid en Mevrouwe schitteren
zullen als twee zonnen te midden van lanteernen.
--Inderdaad, antwoordde de landgraaf, en wat moet ik u betalen voor
dat groot kunstwerk?
--Honderd gulden op voorhand of anderszins, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Hier zijn ze vooraf, sprak de edele landgraaf.
--Allergenadigste heer, hernam Uilenspiegel, gij giet olie in mijne
lamp, ze zal branden te uwer eere.
's Anderen daags vroeg hij aan den landgraaf de hovelingen vóór
hem te doen komen, welke de eer hadden hem op het doek te mogen
vergezelschappen.
Toen kwam de hertog van Luneburg, hoofdman der landsknechten in dienst
van den landgraaf. 't Was een dikke vent, die verging in zijn vet. Hij
naderde Uilenspiegel en fluisterde hem deze woorden in 't oor:
--Als gij mij op de schilderij de helft van mijnen buik niet afneemt,
laat ik u opknoopen door mijne soldaten.
En de hertog ging voort.
Toen kwam een lange dame, die een bochel op den rug had, terwijl haar
borst plat was als het zwaard der wrekende gerechtigheid.
--Heer schilder, sprak zij, als gij mij langs voren geen twee bochels
geeft, in stee van éénen langs achteren, doe ik u als giftmenger
vierendeelen.
En de hofdame ging voort.
Vervolgens kwam een jonge eerejuffer die blond, frisch en lieftallig
was, doch drie tanden miste in de bovenste rij.
--Heer schilder, sprak zij, als ge mij lachen doet en niet al mijne
tanden laat zien, doe ik u in stukskens kappen door mijn minnaar,
die daar staat.
En zij wees naar den kapitein van de boogschutters die den dag te
voren op de trappen van het paleis met de dobbelsteenen speelde;
daarop ging zij voort.
En allen gingen aldus hem voorbij; ten slotte bleef Uilenspiegel
alleen met den edelen landgraaf.
--Als gij het ongeluk hebt, sprak de edele landgraaf, alle die lieden
niet trouwelijk uit te schilderen, laat ik u het hoofd afkappen.
--Zonder hoofd, dacht Uilenspiegel, gevierendeeld, in stukskens
gekapt of voor het minste gehangen, zal het veel voorzichtiger zijn,
niemand te schilderen. Ik zal er over nadenken.
--Waar is de zaal op welker muren ik al die doorluchtige lieden moet
malen? vroeg Uilenspiegel aan den landgraaf.
--Volg mij, sprak de landgraaf.
En hij bracht hem naar een ruime kamer met groote witte muren.
--Hier is zij, sprak hij.
--Het ware goed, zei Uilenspiegel, dat men vóór die muren groote
gordijnen hing, om mijn schilderwerk te behoeden voor stof en voor
de beleediging der vliegen.
--Dat zal geschieden, sprak de edele landgraaf.
Toen de gordijnen hingen, vroeg Uilenspiegel drie leerjongens, om
zijne verven te malen, naar hij zeide.
Dertig dagen lang gastreerden Uilenspiegel en de leerjongens en lieten
zij zich de fijne vleezen en de oude wijnen goed smaken. De landgraaf
zorgde voor alles.
Doch den een en dertigsten dag stak hij zijn neus in de kamer, alwaar
Uilenspiegel gezegd had, dat niemand mocht binnenkomen.
--Hewel, Thijl, sprak hij, waar zijn de portretten?
--Ze zijn verre, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Mag ik ze zien?
--Nog niet.
Den zes en dertigsten kwam hij weer met zijn neus voor de deur.
--Hewel, Thijl? vroeg hij.
--Edele landgraaf, zij gaan op hun laatste.
Den zestigsten dag maakte de landgraaf zich kwaad en, de kamer
binnentredend, sprak hij:
--Op staanden voet gaat gij mij het schilderwerk toonen.
--Ja, geduchte heer, sprak Uilenspiegel, maar gelief het gordijn niet
te openen, alvorens de kapiteins en de edelvrouwen van uw hof hier
binnen te roepen.
--Dat zij komen, sprak de edele landgraaf.
Op dit bevel traden allen binnen.
Uilenspiegel stond voor het dichtgesloten gordijn.
--Doorluchtige Landgraaf, sprak hij, en gij, mevrouwe de Landgravinne,
en gij, hertog van Luneburg, en gij allen, schoone damen en
dappere kapiteins, achter dit gordijn heb ik, op mijn beste, uw
lieve of krijgshaftige gezichten geschilderd. Een iegelijk zal zich
dadelijk herkennen. Gij zijt nieuwsgierig uw konterfeitsel te zien;
't is redelijk, doch verweerdigt u geduld te nemen en laat mij nog
een woord of vijf zeggen. Gij, schoone damen en dappere kapiteins,
die allen van edelen bloede zijt, kunt mijn schilderwerk zien en
bewonderen, maar mocht onder u zich iemand bevinden van onadellijk
bloed, niets zou hij zien dan een witten muur. En nu, verweerdigt U
uwe doorluchtige oogen te openen.
Uilenspiegel schoof het gordijn weg.
--Alleen de edelen kunnen iets zien; lieden van gemeene afkomst
blijven blind voor dit kunststuk.
Al de hovelingen sperden de oogen open, gebaarden in bewondering
te staan, zich zelven en anderen wederzijds te herkennen, doch in
werkelijkheid zagen zij niets dan een naakten muur, hetwelk hen
gansch onthutste.
Doch de nar die aanwezig was, sprong drie voet hoog, en, zijn
narrenstok zwaaiend, sprak hij:
--Men mag mij uitmaken voor boer, en daarenboven voor schurk, voor
deugniet, maar 'k zal het roepen en schreeuwen van de daken, dat ik
daar een witte muur, een naakten muur, een blooten muur voor mijnen
neus heb! Zoo helpe mij God en alle zijne santen.
Uilenspiegel sprak:
--Als de zotten spreken, is 't tijd dat de wijzen optrekken.
Hij wilde het paleis verlaten, als de landgraaf hem tegenhield.
--Snaak, sprak hij, die overal gaat en komt om het schoone en goede
te prijzen en luidkeels te spotten met de dwaasheid; gij, die in
tegenwoordigheid van zooveel grooten der aarde, als man uit het volk,
zoo onbermhertig dorst spotten met hunne blazoenen en voorrechten,
gij zult eens gehangen worden om uw stoute tong.
--Als de koord van goud is, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, zal zij breken
van schrik als ze mij ziet komen.
--Daar, sprak de landgraaf, hem vijftien gulden in de hand stoppend,
zie hier een stukje van de koorde!
--Hertelijk dank, genadige heer, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, elke
afspanning van den weg krijgt er een vezel van, een gouden vezel,
die al die dieven van weerden tot rijkaards maakt.
En hij sprong op den ezel en reed weg, met zijn hoedeken fier naar
omhoog.
LVIII.
De bladeren verdorden op de boomen en de Octoberwind begon te
waaien. Soms was Katelijne gedurende eenige uren bij heur verstand. En
Klaas zei dan dat de geest Gods heur in zijne zoete ontferming kwam
bezoeken. In die oogenblikken had zij de macht, door woorden en
gebaren, Nele te betooveren en dan zag het meisje, meer dan honderd
uren verder, alles wat omging op pleinen, in straten of in huizen.
Op een dag dat Katelijne bij heure zinnen was en oliekoeken at, wel
begoten met dobbele kuite, in gezelschap van Klaas, van Soetkin en
Nele, sprak Klaas:
--'t Is heden de troonafstand van Zijne Heilige Majesteit keizer
Karel. Zeg, Nele, liefste, zoudt gij tot Brussel, in Brabant,
kunnen zien?
--Ja, zoo Katelijne wil, antwoordde Nele.
Katelijne deed het meisje op eene bank zitten en betooverde heur door
woorden en teekenen, en Nele viel zachtjes in slaap.
Katelijne zegde heur:
--Ga in het kleine huis omtrent de Warande, het geliefkoosd verblijf
van keizer Karel.
--Ik ben, sprak Nele stille, in een kleine kamer, groen
geschilderd. Daar zit een man van vier en vijftig jaar, grijs en kaal,
met blonden baard op een vooruitstekende kin, met onheilspellenden
blik in zijne sluwe, wreede en listige oogen. Dien man heet men
Heilige Majesteit. Hij is aamborstig en hoest. Naast hem zit nog
een man, jonger, met een afschuwelijk gelaat gelijk een aap met een
waterhoofd. Ik zag hem te Antwerpen, 't is koning Philippus. Zijne
Heilige Majesteit verwijt hem, dat hij zeker weer bij eene of andere
slet in eene kroeg van de benedenstad uitgeslapen heeft. Hij zegt hem
dat zijn haar naar de taveerne riekt, en dit geen vermaak is voor een
koning die te kiezen heeft tusschen de aanbiddelijkste vrouwen met
satijnen huid, die uit geurige baden komen, wat beter is, zegt hij,
dan een vuile smots die met moeite uit de armen komt van een dronken
soldaat. Geene vrouw, onder de schoonsten en edelsten, 't zij maagd,
gehuwd of weduw, zegt hij hem, zou hem willen wederstaan; trotsch
zouden zij heure minnarijen verlichten met den gloed van wierookvaten,
in stee van het walmende licht eener stinkende vetkeers.
De koning antwoordt Zijne Heilige Majesteit, dat hij hem in alles
gehoorzaam zal wezen. Ik zie dat Zijne Heilige Majesteit een hoestbui
krijgt en eenige slokken kruidenwijn drinkt.
Hij zegt tot Philippus: Aanstonds zullen voor Ons verschijnen de
Staten-Generaal, prelaten, edelen en poorters: Oranje de Zwijger,
Egmond de IJdele, Hoorn de Onbeminde, Brederode de Leeuw en
allen die van het Gulden Vlies, van hetwelk ik u grootmeester zal
maken. Honderden liefhebbers voor dat speelgoed zult gij zien die
zich den neus zouden laten afsnijden, zoo zij het op den borst aan
een gouden ketting mochten dragen, tot teeken van hoogen adel.
Op jammerenden toon vervolgt Zijne Heilige Majesteit tot koning
Philippus: Gij weet mijn zoon, dat ik te uwen voordeele afstand doe,
aan de wereld een grootsch schouwspel ga geven, en voor eene groote
menigte spreken zal, hikkend en hoestend,--want wederom heb ik te
veel gegeten, mijn zoon,--en gij zoudt een steenen hert moeten hebben,
zoo gij, na mij aanhoord te hebben, niet eenige tranen wildet storten.
--Ik zal weenen, vader, antwoord koning Philippus.
Vervolgens spreekt Zijne Heilige Majesteit tot zijn dienstknecht
Dubois.
--Dubois, zegt hij, geef mij een stukje suiker met Madeira: ik heb den
hik. Als mij dat maar niet overkomt terwijl ik het woord voer. Zal
die gans van gisteren dan nooit zakken? Als ik een beker wijn van
Orléans dronk? Neen, die is te hard. Als ik eenige ansjovisjes at? Ze
zijn zoo vettig. Dubois, geef mij een glas Romagne-wijn.
Dubois geeft aan Zijne Heilige Majesteit wat hij vraagt; vervolgens
doet men hem een karmozijnpannen kleed en een gouden mantel aan;
men gordt een zweerd om zijne lenden; in zijne handen steekt men den
schepter en den wereldbol, op zijn hoofd zet men de krone.
Zijne Heilige Majesteit treedt uit het huis der Waranda, gezeten op een
muilezel en gevolgd door koning Philippus en hooge personages. Zij gaan
naar een groot gebouw, dat zij het Paleis heeten, en vinden daar in een
kamer een rijkgekleeden, grooten mageren man, dien zij Oranje noemen.
Zijne heilige Majesteit spreekt dien man aan en zegt:
--Zie ik er goed uit, neef Willem?
--Maar de man geeft geen antwoord.
Daarop zegt Zijne Heilige Majesteit--half lachend, half grammoedig:
--Neef, zult gij dan altijd zwijgen, zelfs om aan een oude pruik de
waarheid te zeggen? Moet ik nog regeeren of moet ik afstand doen,
Zwijger?
--Heilige Majesteit, antwoordt de magere man, als de winter daar is,
laten de sterkste eiken hunne bladeren vallen.
Drie uren slaat de klok.
--Zwijger, zegt hij, leen mij uwen schouder, dat ik er op leune.
En Zijne Majesteit gaat met hem en zijn gevolg een groote zaal binnen,
zet zich neder onder een verhemelte, behangen met karmozijnzijde. Daar
zijn drie stoelen. Zijne Heilige Majesteit neemt den middelste,
die schooner en hooger is dan de andere en waarop een keizerlijke
kroon prijkt; koning Philippus neemt den tweede, en de derde is voor
eene vrouwe, ongetwijfeld eene koningin. Rechts en links zitten,
op gestoffeerde banken, mannen in 't rood gekleed, die om den hals
een gulden schaap dragen. Achter hen staan meerdere personages, die
zeker heeren en prinsen zijn. Rechtover Zijne Heilige Majesteit,
een paar treden lager, zitten in laken gekleede mannen op houten
banken. Ik hoor hen zeggen dat zij zoo zediglijk gekleed en gezeten
zijn, omdat zij alleen alle lasten betalen. Iedereen is rechtgestaan
als Zijne Heilige Majesteit binnenkwam, doch weldra zette hij zich
neer en deed hij iedereen teeken hetzelfde te doen.
Langen tijd spreekt hij over het jicht, daarna overhandigt de vrouw,
die eene koningin schijnt te wezen, Zijne Heilige Majesteit eene rol
perkament, waarop dingen geschreven staan die Zijne Heilige Majesteit
hoestend en met zwakke stemme afleest:
--Ik heb menigvuldige reizen gedaan in Spanje, in Italië, in de
Nederlanden, in Engeland en in Afrika, dit alles voor de glorie Gods,
den roem mijner wapenen en het welzijn mijner volkeren.
Ten slotte zegt hij dat hij zwak en vermoeid is, en dat hij de kroon
van Spanje, de graafschappen, hertogdommen, heerlijkheden van deze
landen wil leggen in de handen van zijnen zoon Philippus.
Hij weent en allen weenen mede.
Nu staat koning Philippus recht en, op de knieën vallend, roept
hij uit:
--Heilige Majesteit, is het mij toegelaten die krone uit uwe handen
te ontvangen, terwijl gij nog zoo bekwaam zijt die met eere te dragen?
Zijne Heilige Majesteit fluistert hem toe een welwillende aanspraak
te houden tot de mannen, die op de gestoffeerde banken zitten.
Koning Philippus keert zich naar hen en zegt op gemelijken toon,
zonder recht te staan:
--Ik ken tamelijk goed Fransch, doch niet genoeg om het woord tot
ulieden te richten. Gij zult hooren wat de bisschop van Atrecht,
mijnheer Granvelle, u mijnentwege zal zeggen.
--Slecht geproken, mijn zoon, lispt Zijne Heilige Majesteit.
En inderdaad, de vergadering mompelt, als zij den jongen koning zoo
fier en zoo trotsch ziet. De vrouwe, die de koningin is, spreekt mede
zijnen lof; nu komt de beurt aan een ouden doctor en als deze gesproken
heeft, geeft Zijne Heilige Majesteit een teeken van dankzegging. Als
die aanspraken en plechtigheden gedaan zijn, verklaart Zijne Heilige
Majesteit zijne onderzaten ontslagen van hunnen eed van getrouwheid;
hij teekent de akten, stapt van zijnen troon en doet er Philippus op
plaats nemen. En iedereen weent. Vervolgens trekken zij terug naar
het huis der Warande.
Daar zijn zij weder getweeën in de groene kamer; zijne Heilige
Majesteit schaterlacht en zegt tot koning Philippus, die niet lacht:
--Hebt gij gezien hoe gauw men met spreken, hikken en lachen die
menschen verteedert? Wat tranenvloed! En die dikke Maes die, op 't
einde zijner aanspraak, begon te weenen gelijk een kind. Gij zelf
scheent ontroerd, doch niet genoegzaam. Dat zijn de vertooningen die
't volk moet hebben. Wij mannen, hebben die minnaressen 't liefst,
die ons 't duurst kosten. En zoo ook is het volk. Hoe meer wij
ze doen betalen, hoe liever ze ons zien. In Duitschland duldde ik
den hervormden eeredienst, dien ik in de Nederlanden strengelijk
strafte. Als de prinsen van Duitschland katholiek geweest waren, dan
ware ik Lutheraan geworden om hunne goederen verbeurd te verklaren. Zij
denken dat mijn ijver voor 't Roomsch geloove oprecht is, en 't spijt
hun dat ik hen verlaat. Door mijn toedoen zijn, in de Nederlanden,
uit hoofde van ketterije, vijftig duizend hunner dapperste mannen en
bevalligste meidekens om hals gebracht. Zonder de verbeurdverklaringen
te rekenen, deed ik hun meer schattingen en beden betalen dan Indië
en Peru samen: zij zijn droef mij te verliezen. Ik heb den vrede van
Cadzand gescheurd, Gent, de fiere stad, getemd, uit den weg geruimd wat
mij hinderen kon; vrijheden, keuren en privileges, alles is onderworpen
aan 't gezag van de keizerlijke ambtenaren. Die goede menschen wanen
zich vrij, omdat ik hun toelaat boogschietingen te houden en hunne
gildevaandels plechtiglijk door de straten te dragen. Zij voelen mijn
meesterschap; in eene kevie gestoken, bevinden zij er zich goed: zij
zingen en betreuren mij. Mijn zoon, wees met hen, lijk ik het was:
zoet van woorden, ruw van daden; geef likjes zoolang gij niet bijten
moet. Zweer, zweer altijd op hunne vrijheden, keuren en privileges,
doch vernietig ze, zoodra ze u een gevaar kunnen worden. IJzer zijn
zij, als men ze met schuchtere handen aanraakt, glas als men ze met
een sterken arm breekt. Bestrijd de ketterije, niet om haar verschil
met den Roomschen godsdienst, maar omdat zij, in de Nederlanden,
eindigen zou met ons gezag te vernielen; zij die den Paus met zijne
drie kronen aanvallen, zouden gauw gedaan krijgen met vorsten die er
maar ééne dragen. Maak als ik van de vrijheid van geweten eene daad
van majesteitsschennis, met verbeurte van goederen, en gij zult erven,
gelijk ik heel mijn leven geërfd heb; en als gij hen zult verlaten
om afstand te doen of te sterven, zullen zij zeggen: Heil! de goede
vorst! En zij zullen weenen!
--En ik hoore niets meer, vervolgde Nele; Zijne Heilige Majesteit is
op een praalbed gaan liggen en slaapt, en koning Philippus, trotsch
en vermetel, staart hem koel en liefdeloos aan.
Op die woorden werd Nele gewekt door Katelijne.
En Klaas bleef, in gedachten verslonden, kijken naar de vlam die in
den heerd flikkerde.
LIX.
Uilenspiegel verliet den landgraaf van Hessen en besteeg zijn
ezel. Toen hij over de Groote Markt reed, zag hij verbolgen gezichten
van eenige heeren en damen, maar dat deerde hem niet.
Weldra kwam hij op het grondgebied van den hertog van Luneburg en
ontmoette daar een troep Smadelijke Broeders, lustige Vlamingen van
Sluis, die alle Zaterdagen geld uitlegden om eens per jaar eene reize
in Duitschland te doen.
Zij zaten in een open wagen, bespannen met een kloek peerd uit het
Veurne--Ambacht, en zoo reden zij zingend en juichend door de wegen
en sompen van het hertogdom Luneburg. Er waren er die op de pijp,
de schalmeie, den vedel, den doedelzak speelden, en dat alles maakte
groot lawaai. Naast den wagen liep veeltijds een dikzak die op een
rommelpot speelde, in de hope wat te vermageren.
Zij waren aan hun laatsten gulden; als zij Uilenspiegel
zagen komen, riepen zij hem eene afspanning binnen om hem te
trakteeren. Uilenspiegel nam gereedelijk aan. Daar hij zag dat de
Smadelijke Broeders tot elkaar knipoogden en heimelijk lachten,
terwijl zij hem inschonken, begreep hij dat men hem eene poets wilde
bakken. Hij ging buiten, doch bleef aan de deur luisteren. Hij hoorde
den dikzak zeggen:
--'t Is de schilder van den landgraaf, die hem meer dan duizend gulden
gaf om zijn portret te maken. Onthalen wij hem op bier en op wijn,
en hij zal dobbel en dik tegenbetalen.
--Amen, zegden de anderen.
Uilenspiegel zadelde zijn ezel, bracht hem duizend passen verder,
bij een pachter en gaf twee oortjes aan de meid om op het dier te
letten. Vervolgens keerde hij terug naar de taveerne en zette zich neer
bij de Smadelijke Broeders, zonder van iets te gebaren. Ze schonken
hem in en betaalden 't gelag. Uilenspiegel liet de guldens van den
landgraaf in zijne tassche rinkelen en zei, dat hij zoo even aan
eenen boer zijnen ezel verkocht had voor zeventien zilveren daalders.
De dikzak die op den rommelpot speelde, ging bij den baas en sprak,
naar Uilenspiegel wijzend:
--'t Is de schilder van den landgraaf, hij zal alles betalen.
Als de baas guldens en daalders in Uilenspiegel's tassche hoorde
rammelen, bracht hij eten en drinken op tafel. Uilenspiegel
liet het zich goed smaken. En altijd rinkelde het geld in zijne
beurze. Menigwerf had hij ook op zijnen hoed geslagen en gezegd dat
daar zijn grootste schat stak. Als de smulpartij twee dagen en eenen
nacht geduurd had, zeiden de Smadelijke Broeders tot Uilenspiegel:
--Laat ons opkramen en 't gelag betalen.
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Als een rat in een kaas zit, vraagt zij om ergens elders te gaan?
--Neen, spraken zij.
--En als een mensch goed eten en drinken heeft, vraagt hij naar het
stof van de wegen of naar 't water van de grachten die vol echelen
steken?
--Neen, spraken zij.
--Laat ons dus hier blijven, vervolgde Uilenspiegel, zoolang mijne
guldens en daalders ons dienen tot trechters om de goddelijke dranken
van den baas in onze kelen te gieten.
En hij zei tot den baas van nog wijn en nog worsten te brengen.
Terwijl zij aten en dronken, sprak Uilenspiegel:
--Ik betaal alles, nu ben ik eens de landgraaf. Als mijne beurze
ledig was, wat zoudt gij doen, kameraden? Als dat ongeluk overkomt,
neemt dan mijn vilten hoedeken: het steekt vol gouden karolussen.
--Laat ons eens tasten, spraken allen te gader.
En zuchtend, voelden zij tusschen hunne vingeren groote geldstukken
die gouden karolussen moesten zijn. Doch een hunner bleef den hoed
met zooveel vriendschap vasthouden, dat Uilenspiegel hem den hoed
moest afnemen, zeggende:
--Ongeduldige koeier, wacht ten minste tot het uur van melken daar is.
--Geef mij de helft van uw hoedeken, sprak de Smadelijke Broeder.
--Neen, sprak Uilenspiegel, want schadelijk ware het voor uwe hersenen
half in de zonne en half in de schaduw te loopen.
En, zijn hoofddeksel aan de baas gevend, sprak hij:
--Houd hem goed vast, het is wat te warm. Ik ga mij wat lichter maken.
Hij ging buiten en de baas hield het hoedeken vast.
Maar Uilenspiegel liep naar den boer, steeg op zijn ezel en sloeg
den weg in naar Emden.
Als de Smadelijke Broeders, hem niet zagen terugkomen, zeiden zij
tot elkander:
--Zou hij weg zijn? Wie zal dan 't gelag betalen?
De baas kreeg argwaan en sneed Uilenspiegels hoed middendoor.
Maar in stee van karolussen, vond hij tusschen het vilt en de voering
niets dan kwade koperen penningen.
Toen voer hij heftig uit tegen de Smadelijke Broeders.
--Diefelijke broeders, gij gaat niet uit mijn huis, vóór dat gij mij
al uwe kleederen gelaten hebt, behalve uwe hemde, sprak hij.
En zij moesten zich uitkleeden om hun gelag te betalen. In hun hemde
reden zij aldus over velden en wegen, want zij hadden hun peerd noch
hun wagen willen verkoopen.
En een iegelijk onderweg had medelijden met hen en gaf hun geerne wat
brood, wat bier en soms ook een stuk vleesch; want overal zegden zij
dat zij door dieven uitgeschud waren.
En zij hadden in 't gelijk maar ééne hooze.
Zoo kwamen zij naar Sluis terug, in hun hemde op de wagen dansend en
op den rommelpot spelend.
LX.
Intusschen reed Uilenspiegel op zijn ezel door de landen en sompen
van den hertog van Lunenburg, het Watersignoorken, zooals de Vlamingen
hem heetten.
Jef gehoorzaamde Uilenspiegel als een hondje, dronk bruinbier, danste
beter dan een Hongaarsche dansmeester en legde zich, bij het minste
teeken, op den rug met de vier pooten omhoog.
Uilenspiegel wist dat de hertog van Lunenburg--verbolgen omdat hij,
te Darmstadt, in tegenwoordigheid van den landgraaf van Hessen, met
hem den spot had gedreven--hem op straffe van den strop den toegang
tot zijn grondgebied ontzegd had.
Plotseling zag Uilenspiegel Zijne Hertogelijke Hoogheid in persoon
aankomen en mits hij zijn geweldig karakter kende, werd hij bang. Hij
sprak tot zijn ezel:
--Jef, jongen, daar komt de hertog van Lunenburg. Aan den hals voel
ik een groote krieuweling; nu, Jef, ik zou niet geerne gehangen
worden. Gedenk dat wij broeders in ellende en in lange ooren zijn;
gedenk ook welk een goeden vriend gij aan mij zoudt verliezen.
En Uilenspiegel wischte zich de oogen en Jef begon te balken.
--Wij leven samen gelukkig, vervolgde Uilenspiegel, of rampspoedig,
naarvolgens de omstandigheden; gedenk dat, Jef!--De ezel balkte
voort, want hij had honger.--En nooit zult ge mij vergeten, sprak
zijn meester, want welke liefde is sterker dan die, welke dezelfde
vreugde beleeft en denzelfden rampspoed beweent? Jef, jongen, gij
moet u op den rug leggen.
De zachtaardige ezel deed wat zijn meester begeerde en de hertog zag
hem met de vier pikkels omhoog liggen. Uilenspiegel zette zich neer
op den buik van den ezel.
--Wat doet gij daar? sprak de hertog. Weet gij dan niet dat ik, bij
mijn laatste plakkaat, u verboden heb uwe stoffige voeten in mijne
gewesten te zetten?
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Genadige heer, heb erbarming met mij.
En naar zijn ezel wijzend:
--Gij weet wel, heer, dat hij, die tusschen zijne vier palen woont,
bij wet en recht immmer vrij is.
De hertog antwoordde:
--Verlaat mijne gewesten of gij zult sterven!
--Genadige heer, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, met een paar gulden zou ik
er rapper buitenrollen.
--Nietdeug, sprak de hertog, het is u niet genoeg ongehoorzaam te zijn,
ge vraagt er mij nog geld bij!
--Ik moet het wel vragen, heer, mits ik het niet nemen kan.
De hertog gaf hem een gulden.
Toen sprak Uilenspiegel tot zijn ezel:
--Jef, sta op en groet Zijne Hoogheid.
De ezel stond op en begon te balken. Toen gingen beiden hun weg.
LXI.
Soetkin en Nele zaten aan een der vensteren van de hut en keken naar
de straat. En Soetkin sprak tot Nele:
--Liefste, ziet gij mijn zoon Uilenspiegel niet komen?
--Neen, sprak Nele, dien leelijken landlooper zien wij nooit meer
terug.
Nele, antwoordde Soetkin, gij moogt niet kwaad zijn, maar gij moet
hem beklagen, omdat hij niet bij ons is, de arme jongen!
--Ik weet het, sprak Nele, maar hij heeft elders een huis, verre van
hier, een huis, rijker dan 't zijne, waar hij zeker door een schoone
dame getroeteld wordt.
--'t Ware gelukkig voor hem, zei Soetkin; daar eet hij misschien
ortolanen.
--Dat men hem keien te eten gaf, zuchtte Nele, gauw zou hij hier zijn
de slokker.
Soetkin lachte en zei:
--Van waar, liefste, die boosheid?
Maar Klaas, die stil in zijn hoekje mutsaards bond, antwoordde:
--Ziet gij dan niet dat Nele verliefd is?
--Wel, sprak Soetkin, wat doortrapte meid, die mij daar nooit een
woord over sprak. Is 't waar, liefste, hebt gij er zin in?
--Geloof er niets van, sprak Nele.
--Gij zult, zei Klaas, een goeden man aan hem hebben, met een grooten
mond, een hollen buik en een lange tonge, die van de guldens duiten
zal maken en nooit een oortje van zijnen arbeid, een straatlooper en
een nietdeug.
Doch, blozend en kwaad, antwoordde Nele:
--Waarom hebt gij hem niet anders gemaakt?
--Daar weent ze nu, sprak Soetkin, zwijg toch, man.
LXII.
Als Uilenspiegel te Neurenberg kwam, gaf hij zich uit voor grootmeester
in de medicijnen, overwinnaar van alle kwalen, wereldberoemd
lichaamzuiveraar, die pest, koorts en alle ziekten verdreef.
In het gasthuis van die stad lagen zooveel zieken dat men ten einde
raad was. De overste had de komst van Uilenspiegel vernomen; hij ging
hem bezoeken en vroeg of hij werkelijk allerlei ziekten genezen kon?
--Uitgenomen de laatste, antwoordde Uilenspiegel; maar beloof mij
tweehonderd gulden voor genezing der overigen; doch ik wil geen duit,
als al uwe zieken niet zeggen, dat zij genezen zijn en het gasthuis
kunnen verlaten.
's Anderen daags trad hij, met doctorale waardigheid de ziekenzaal
binnen. Hij ging overal rond, bezocht elken zieke afzonderlijk en zei:
--Zweer mij dat gij aan niemand zult zeggen wat ik u in het oor ga
vertellen. Welke ziekte hebt gij?
De kranke zei het hem, en zwoer bij hoog en leeg te zullen zwijgen.
--Weet, sprak Uilenspiegel, dat ik morgen een uwer tot asch moet
verbranden, om daarmede een wonderbaar geneesmiddel te bereiden, dat
alle zieken zullen te drinken krijgen. Hij, die niet gaan kan, wordt
tot pulver verbrand. Morgen kom ik terug met de overste, en ik zal
roepen: "Dat al degenen die niet ziek zijn, hun pak maken en heengaan."
Den volgenden morgen kwam Uilenspiegel en riep gelijk hij gezegd
had. Al de zieken, kreupelen, jichtlijders, koortslijders, wilden om
't zeerste buiten. En zelfs zij die in geen tien jaar uit hun bedde
waren gekomen, liepen de straat op.
De overste vroeg of zij genezen waren en of zij gaan konden.
--Ja, antwoordden zij, in 't gedacht dat er één op de binnenplaats
tot assche verbrand werd.
Toen sprak Uilenspiegel tot den overste:
--Betaal mij; gij ziet, allen zijn buiten en verklaren dat zij
genezen zijn.
De overste betaalde hem tweehonderd gulden, en Uilenspiegel spoedde
zich buiten de stad.
Maar twee dagen nadien zag de overste alle zijne zieken zieker
terugkomen, behalve één dien de frissche lucht genezen had, en die nu
dronken door de straten liep, al zingende: "Hoezee voor den grooten
dokter Uilenspiegel!"
LXIII.
Als de tweehonderd gulden verteerd waren, kwam Uilenspiegel te Weenen,
alwaar hij zich verhuurde bij eenen wagenmaker, die zijne gasten
gedurig beknorde, omdat zij den blaasbalg van de smidse niet vlug
genoeg trokken.
--Op maat schreeuwde hij, en volgt met den blaasbalg.
Eens dat de baas naar zijnen hof ging, maakte Uilenspiegel den
blaasbalg los, schouderde hem en volgde aldus zijnen meester. Als
deze verwonderd opkeek, sprak Uilenspiegel.
--Baas, gij hebt mij geheeten met den blaasbalg te volgen, waar moet
ik hem leggen, terwijl ik de anderen haal?
--Jongen, antwoordde de baas, dat heb ik u niet gezegd, breng den
blaasbalg op zijne plaats terug.
Maar de baas wilde hem die poets betaald zetten. Hij stond, van
dien dag af, te middernacht op, maakte zijne gasten wakker en deed
hen werken.
De werklieden spraken:
--Baas, waarom wekt gij ons te midden van den nacht?
--Ik heb de gewoonte, antwoordde de baas, mijne gasten de eerste
zeven dagen maar een halven nacht te laten slapen.
Den volgende nacht, wekte hij weer zijne gasten te
middernacht. Uilenspiegel, die op den zolder sliep, bond zijn bed op
zijnen rug en kwam aldus de smidse binnen.
De baas sprak tot hem:
--Zijt gij zot? Waarom laat gij uw bed niet op zijne plaats?
--Ik heb de gewoonte, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, de eerste zeven dagen
van de week de helft van den nacht op mijn bed en de andere helft
onder mijn bed te slapen.
--Zoo, antwoordde de meester, maar ik heb nog een tweede gewoonte, dat
is van mijne onbeschaamde gasten op straat te smijten, met toelating
de eerste week boven den grond, en de tweede onder den grond door
te brengen.
--In uwen kelder, baas, bij de tonnen bruinbier?
LXIV.
Als Uilenspiegel den wagenmaker verlaten had, verhuurde hij zich,
op de terugreis naar Vlaanderen, als leerknaap bij eenen schoenmaker,
die liever aan zijne deur stond, dan met zijne else op den stoel zat.
Uilenspiegel, die hem voor de honderdste maal zag opstaan, vroeg hoe
hij de overleeren moest snijden.
--Snijdt er, sprak de baas, voor groote en middelmatig voeten, opdat
zij passen aan al wie groot of klein vee drijft.
--Zoo zal geschieden, baas, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
Als de schoenmaker weg was, sneed Uilenspiegel overleeren die alleen
goed waren voor merriën, ezelinnen, veerzen, zeugen en ooien.
Als de baas terug in zijn werkhuis kwam en zijn leder versneden zag,
riep hij uit:
--Wat steekt gij daar uit?
--Wat gij mij gezegd hebt, was 't antwoord van Uilenspiegel.
--Ik heb u gezegd, hernam de baas, schoenen te snijden die passen
aan allen die ossen, varkens en schapen drijven, en nu snijdt gij
schoenen voor die beesten.
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Baas, in dit seizoen waarin alle beesten minneziek zijn, wie anders
dan de zeug, de ezelin, de veers en de ooie mennen den beer, den ezel,
den stier en den ram?
Hij maakte zich buiten, doch hij mocht niet meer binnen.
LXV.
Het was in de Grasmaand, de lucht was zoet, doch nadien begon het te
vriezen en de hemel zag grijs als op Allerzielen. Uilenspiegel's derde
jaar ballingschap was sedert lang verstreken, en Nele verwachtte alle
dagen heuren hertsvriend terug.
--Laas! sprak zij, 't gaat sneeuwen op de kersebloesems, op de
bloeiende seringa's, op al de arme planten die bij de zoele warmte
eener vroege lente vol hope ontloken waren. Lichte sneeuwvlokjes
vallen reeds op de wegen. En 't sneeuwt ook op mijn arm herte.
Waar zijn zij, de heldere zonnestralen, die de gezichten verblijden,
de daken rooder maken, den hemel blauw en de ruiten vlammend? Waar
zijn zij die warmte schenken aan aarde, lucht, aan vogelen en
insecten? Laas! nu heb ik dag en nacht koude van droefheid en bangen
twijfel. Waar zijt gij mijn lief, mijn Uilenspiegel?
LXVI.
Uilenspiegel naderde Ronse, en hij had honger en dorst, doch wilde
niet klagen; hij beproefde de menschen te doen lachen om aan brood
te geraken. Maar het ging hem niet af, de menschen kwamen en gingen
en gaven hem niets.
Het was koud, beurtelings sneeuwde, regende en hagelde het op den
rug van den zwerver. Als hij een hond een been zag afknagen, kwam
het water hem in den mond. Hij had wel een gulden willen verdienen,
doch wist niet hoe hij een gulden in zijne tassche zou krijgen.
Omhoog zoekend, zag hij duiven die van hunne piere witte plakjes
op den weg lieten vallen, maar guldens waren het niet. Hij zocht
langs de groote wegen, maar ook tusschen de kasseien schoten geene
guldens omhoog.
Rechts zoekend, zag hij wel een grimmige wolk in de lucht drijven,
maar hij wist wel dat, zoo er uit dien gieter iets moest vallen,
het geene guldenbui zou wezen. Links vorschend, zag hij een grooten,
luien kastanjelaar, die leefde en waste zonder iets te verrichten.
--Ha! sprak hij, waarom zijn er ook geen guldenaars? Daar zouden
schoone vruchten aan groeien.
Eensklaps barstte de zwarte wolk, en de hagelsteenen vielen en sloegen
geducht op Uilenspiegel's rug.
--Laas, sprak hij, ik voel het wel, 't is alleen naar dwalende honden
dat men steenen smijt.--Toen zette hij het op een loopen.--'t Is
mijne schuld niet, vervolgde hij, als ik geen paleis of zelfs geen
tent heb om mijn schraal lichaam te beschutten. Ho! die leelijke
hagelsteenen, zij zijn hard als kogels. Neen, 't is mijne schuld
niet, als ik in lompen gehuld de wereld rondzwerf, 't is enkellijk
omdat het mij behaagt. Waarom ben ik geen keizer? Die hagelsteenen
willen, lijk slechte woorden, halsstarrig in mijne ooren dringen.--En
hij liep.--Arme neus, voegde hij erbij, weldra zijt gij doorboord,
en kunt gij dienen tot pepervat op de festijnen van de grooten der
aarde, op wie het nooit te hagelen pleegt. En zijne kaken afwisschend,
sprak hij:--Deze kunnen weldra dienen tot schuimspanen voor de koks,
die het te warm bij hunne ovens hebben. Ha! verre herinnering aan
heerlijke pastijen van weleer! Ik heb honger. Ledige buik, beklaag
u niet, jammerende ingewanden, houdt u stil. Fortuin, waar zit gij
nu? breng mij ergens waar ik te eten vind.
Terwijl hij aldus tot zich zelven sprak, werd de hemel helder; het
hagelde niet meer, de zonne vertoonde zich en Uilenspiegel sprak:--Daar
is de zonne, mijne eenige vriendin, die mij komt drogen! Maar eensklaps
zag hij van verre op den weg een gespikkelden hond op zich afkomen,
met hangende tong en puilende oogen.
--Dat beest is razend, riep Uilenspiegel. Hij raapte een grooten steen
op en klom gezwind in een boom; nauwelijks had hij den eersten tak
bereikt, of de hond was dáár, en Uilenspiegel smeet hem den steen op
den kop. De hond bleef staan, trachtte nog Uilenspiegel te bijten,
maar hij kon niet en viel dood ten gronde.
Dat deed Uilenspiegel geen genoegen en te minder daar hij, beneden
gekomen, zag dat de hond geen drogen muil had, gelijk gewoonlijk bij
dolle honden 't geval is. Vervolgens het vel beziende, zei hij tot
zich zelven dat het schoon genoeg was om te verkoopen; hij stroopte
het, waschte het, hing het aan een paal, liet het in de zonne wat
drogen en stak het in zijne tassche.
Daar honger en dorst hem kwelden, ging hij eenige hoeven binnen,
doch dorst het vel niet te koop bieden, uit vreeze dat de hond aan
den boer toebehoord had. Hij vroeg een stuk brood, maar men weigerde
het hem. De nacht kwam. Zijne beenen waren vermoeid en hij ging een
kleine afspanning binnen. Daar zag hij een oude bazin, die een ouden
hond streelde, wiens vel op dat van den doode geleek.
--Van waar komt gij, reiziger? vroeg de oude bazinne.
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Ik kom van Rome, alwaar ik den hond van den Paus van eene verkoudheid
genas, die hem grootelijks hinderde.
--Hebt gij den Paus gezien? vroeg zij, een glas bier tappend.
--Laas! zei Uilenspiegel, het glas ledigend, het is mij alleen
toegestaan geweest zijn heilige voeten en zijn doorluchtige muilen
te kussen.
De oude hond van de bazinne kuchte, doch spuwde niet.
--Wanneer deedt gij dat? vroeg de oude.
--Nu twee maanden geleden, antwoordde Uilenspiegel. Men verwachtte
mij, ik kwam en klopte:--Wie is daar? vroeg de aartsdoorluchtige,
aartsgeheime en aartsbuitengewone kardinaal-kamerheer van Zijne
Zeer Heilige Heiligheid.--Ik, heer kardinaal, antwoordde ik, ik
kom opzettelijk uit Vlaanderen om de voeten van den Paus te kussen
en zijnen hond van het slijm te verlossen.--Ha! zijt gij het,
Uilenspiegel? sprak de Paus langs den anderen kant, achter een
deurken. Het zou mij veel genoegen doen u te zien, maar nu is dat
onmogelijk. De heilige Decretalen verbieden mij mijn gezicht aan de
vreemdelingen te toonen, als men er met het heilige scheermes over
gaat--Laas! zei ik, het slaat mij erg tegen, ik was uit verre landen
gekomen om de voeten Uwer Heiligheid te kussen en zijn hond van het
slijm te genezen. Moet ik onverrichter zake terugkeeren?--Neen, sprak
de Heilige Vader; vervolgens hoorde ik hem roepen:--Aartskamerheer,
schuif mijn stoel tot bij de deur en open het schuifken. Zoo
werd gedaan.--En door het schuifje zag ik twee voeten steken met
gouden muilen aan, en 'k hoorde eene stem die als de donder rolde,
zeggen:--Dit zijn de doorluchtige voeten van den Prins der Prinsen,
den Koning der Koningen, den Keizer der Keizers. Kus, geloovige,
kus de heilige muilen. En ik kuste de heilige muilen en mijn neus was
gansch vervuld met den hemelschen geur die uit die voeten opsteeg. Toen
ging het schuifken weder toe en dezelfde geduchte stemme gebood mij te
wachten. De deur ging toen open en daar kwam een hond te voorschijn,
om de waarheid te zeggen, een ruige, kuchende hond met loopende oogen
en zoo opgeblazen, dat hij schier niet gaan kon.
De Heilige Vader verweerdigde zich nog mij te zeggen:--Uilenspiegel,
gij ziet mijnen hond; hij heeft slijm en andere ziekten gekregen met
te knagen aan het gebeente van geradbraakte ketteren. Genees hem,
mijn zoon, gij zult er u wel mee bevinden.
--Drink, sprak de oude.
--Schenk, antwoordde Uilenspiegel. Zijne rede vervolgend, sprak hij:
Ik deed den hond purgeeren door middel van een wonderbaar drankje,
dat ik zelf gereedgemaakt heb. Hij piste drie dagen en drie nachten
aan één stuk, en was toen genezen.
--Jezus, Maria! sprak de oude, laat mij u kussen, doorluchtige pelgrim,
die den Paus gezien hebt en ook mijn hond kunt genezen.
Doch Uilenspiegel, die niet erg ingenomen was met de kussen der oude,
sprak:--Zij, wier lippen de heilige muilen aangeraakt hebben, mogen,
twee jaar lang, geene kussen van eenige vrouwe ontvangen. Geef mij
wat goede karbonaden, een koppel bloedworsten en bier in overvloed,
en ik zal uwen hond zulke heldere stem geven, dat hij gemakkelijk
zal kunnen meezingen op de okzaal in de groote kerk.
--Mocht het waar zijn, sprak de oude, ik gaf u een gulden voor
uwe moeite.
--Ik zal het doen, sprak Uilenspiegel, maar slechts na het eten.
Zij diende hem alles wat hij gevraagd had. Hij at en dronk zijn
bekomst en had wel, uit erkentelijkheid, de oude gekust, hadde hij
niet gezegd dat dit niet mogelijk was.
Terwijl hij sprak, kwam de oude hond met zijne pooten op zijne
knieën om een stuksken te vragen. Uilenspiegel gaf er hem meerdere;
vervolgens sprak hij tot de hospita:
--Wat zoudt gij doen, als iemand bij u at en niet wilde betalen?
--Ik zou den dief zijn opperste kleed afnemen, sprak de oude.
--Goed, sprak Uilenspiegel; daarna nam hij den hond in den arm en
ging er mee naar den stal, alwaar hij hem opsloot met een been. Hij
nam het vel van den dooden hond en, bij de oude terugkomend, vroeg
hij haar of zij bij heur woord bleef, dat zij het opperste kleed zou
uitdoen van dengene die at zonder betalen.
--Zeker, antwoordde zij.
--Wel, uw hond heeft met mij medegegeten zonder betalen; en ik heb
hem volgens uw voorschrift zijn opperste en eenig kleed uitgedaan.
En hij toonde heur de huid van den dooden hond.
--Ha! snikte de oude, dat is wreed van u, mijnheer de dokter. Arm
hondje! het was mij als een kind. Waarom ontnaamt gij mij den eenigen
vriend, dien ik op aarde bezat? Nu mag ik sterven!
--Ik zal hem weder in 't leven roepen, sprak Uilenspiegel.
--Weder in 't leven! sprak zij. En hij zal mij nog streelen, nog
aankijken, nog likjes geven? Doe het, mijnheer de dokter; niet
alleenlijk zult gij voor niet een lekker maal hebben genoten, maar
'k geef u nog een gulden op den koop toe.
--Ik zal hem weder in 't leven roepen, sprak Uilenspiegel, maar ik
moet warm water hebben, siroop om de voegen van het nieuw vel toe
te plakken, eene naald en garen, en saus van karbonaden, en men moet
mij alleen laten.
De oude gaf hem alles wat hij vroeg; en hij trok met het vel van den
dooden hond naar den stal.
Daar streek hij saus aan den snoet van den ouden hond, die hem liet
begaan; van onderen op zijnen buik en aan zijne pooten maakte hij
groote streepen met siroop.
Hij stiet driemaal een grooten schreeuw en sprak: Sta op! sta op! ik
beveel het, vuile hond!
Vervolgens stak hij gezwind het vel van den dooden hond in zijne
tassche, gaf den levenden hond een schop en joeg hem alzoo de
gelagkamer binnen.
Als de oude heuren hond levend en likkebaardend terugzag, wilde zij
hem kussen van geluk. Maar Uilenspiegel liet het haar niet toe.
--Gij moogt uwen hond maar streelen, sprak hij, als hij al de siroop
afgelikt heeft die aan zijn vel plakt; dan eerst zullen de naden goed
dicht zijn. Tel mij nu mijne tien gulden.
--Eén had ik gezeid, sprak de oude.
--Eén voor het nieuw vel en negen om den hond in 't leven te roepen.
En zij telde ze hem. Uilenspiegel toog henen en smeet het vel van den
dooden hond in de gelagkamer, zeggende:--Daar, vrouwe, bewaar het oude
vel, het kan dienen om het nieuwe te vermaken, als de mot er in komt.
LXVII.
Dien Zondag ging te Brugge de Heilig-Bloedprocessie uit. Klaas zei
tot zijne vrouw en tot Nele van er heen te gaan, daar zij misschien
Uilenspiegel in de stad zouden ontmoeten. Hij zelf zou thuis blijven
om den pelgrim te ontvangen, mocht hij terugkomen.
De vrouwen vertrokken getweeën. Klaas bleef aan zijne deur zitten
en vond Damme doodsch en verlaten. Hij hoorde niets dan het kleppen
van eene of andere dorpsklok in 't ronde, terwijl de wind, bijwijlen
uit Brugge, het getintel van den beiaard en een groot geraas van
falkonetten en van vuurpijlen bracht, die ter eere van het Heilig
Bloed afgeschoten werden.
Klaas zocht droomerig Uilenspiegel op de wegen, doch hij zag niets
dan een blauwen, onbewolkten hemel, eenige honden die met hangende
tong in de zonne lagen, wat musschen die tjilpend zich wentelden in
't stof, eene kat die ze beloerde, en het zonnelicht dat vriendelijk
in al de huizen drong en er de koperen ketels en tinnen pateelen op
den schoorsteen glinsteren deed.
Doch Klaas was treurig te midden van al die vreugd en, zijn zoon
zoekend, tuurde hij in den dikken damp, die over de weiden hing en
spitste het oor om te luisteren of hij hem niet hoorde tusschen het
blijde geritsel der bladeren en het vroolijk gekweel der vogelen in
de boomen. Eensklaps zag hij op den weg van Maldegem een man van
lange gestalte afkomen, maar seffens zag hij dat het Uilenspiegel
niet was. Hij zag hem stilstaan bij een rapenveld en gulzig eenige
dier knollen opeten.
--Die moet grooten honger hebben, sprak Klaas.
Nadat hij hem een oogenblik uit het zicht verloren had, zag hij
hem weder te voorschijn komen aan den hoek van de Reigerstraat,
en hij herkende den bode van Judocus, die hem zevenhonderd gouden
karolusguldens gebracht had. Hij ging hem tegemoet en sprak:
--Kom binnen!
De man antwoordde:
--Gezegend zijn zij, die goed zijn jegens den dolenden reiziger.
Buiten op de vensterbank lagen broodkruimelen, die Soetkin voor de
vogelen had gestrooid. Zij kwamen daar 's winters hun eten zoeken. De
man nam de brokkelingen en at ze gulzig op.
--Gij hebt honger en dorst, sprak Klaas.
--Voor acht dagen werd ik uitgestroopt door de roovers, sprak de man,
en sedert dien voed ik mij met rapen en wortelen langs de wegen.
--'t Is dus tijd eenige versterking te nemen. Hier is, sprak Klaas,
de schapraai openend, hier is eene teil vol boonen, hier zijn eieren,
pensen, hesp, Gentsche worst, en nog hier is waterzooi. Beneden in
den kelder ligt Leuvensche wijn te rusten, die bereid is naar de wijze
van Bourgondië, als robijn zoo rood en zoo klaar. Hij vraagt maar om
gedronken te worden. Nu, wij gaan wat hout op het vuur doen. Hoort
gij de pensen zingen op den rooster? Dat is een liedje van wellust.
Klaas keerde de pensen op den rooster en sprak:
--Hebt gij mijn zoon, mijn Uilenspiegel, niet gezien?
--Neen, antwoordde hij.
--Brengt gij nieuws van Judocus, mijn broeder? vroeg Klaas, terwijl hij
alles opdiende: gerooste pensen, een eierpannekoek, kaas, twee groote
bekers en Leuvenschen wijn, die helder en rood in de bottels flikkerde.
De man antwoordde:
--Uw broeder is te Sippenaken gestorven op het rad. En dit om, als
ketter, de wapenen tegen den keizer te hebben gevoerd.
Klaas was als waanzinnig en beefde, over gansch zijn lijf, zoo groot
was zijn gramschap.
--De beulen, de moordenaars! Judocus! mijn arme broeder!
--Onze vreugde en onze smerten zijn niet van deze wereld, zegde de man.
En hij begon te eten. Vervolgens sprak hij:
--Ik heb uw broeder bijgestaan in het gevang, ik deed mij doorgaan
voor een zijner neven. Ik kom alhier, omdat hij mij zeide: Ga bij mijn
broeder Klaas, als gij voor 't geloove niet sterft als ik; zeg hem van
in den vrede des Heeren te leven, door werken van bermhertigheid te
plegen en zijn zoon heimelijk in de wet van Christus op te brengen. Het
geld dat ik hem gaf, werd genomen van het arme, onwetende volk; dat hij
het gebruike om Thijl op te voeden in de leering van God en zijn woord.
Op die rede, gaf de bode aan Klaas den vredekus.
En Klaas jammerde:
--Op het rad gestorven! mijn arme broeder!
En zoo groot was zijn smert, dat hij niet tot bezinning kon
komen. Doch, daar hij zag dat de man dorst had en zijn glas uitstak,
schonk hij hem wijn in, maar hij at en dronk zonder vreugde.
Soetkin en Nele bleven zeven dagen weg; gedurende dien tijd bleef de
bode de gast van den koolbrander.
Al die nachten hoorden zij Katelijne huilen:
--Het vuur! het vuur! Maak open, maak open; de ziel wil er uit!
En als Klaas naar heure hut ging, stilde hij heur met zoete woorden.
Na zeven dagen toog de vreemde henen, zonder iets van Klaas te willen
aanveerden dan twee karolussen, om onderwege te eten en te slapen.
LXVIII.
Nele en Soetkin waren van Brugge teruggekomen. Klaas zat in de keuken
als een kleermaker, knoopen aan een oude hooze te naaien. Nele stond
naast hem en hitste tegen den ooievaar Titus Bibulus Snuffius op, die
beurtelings vooruit en achteruit sprong en kefte. De ooievaar stond,
op één poot, hem ernstig te bezien, met zijn langen hals in de pluimen
zijner borst. Als Titus Bibulus Snuffius hem zoo vreedzaam zag, kefte
hij nog meer. Maar de vogel, wien die muziek op den duur verveelde,
gaf eensklaps eenen slag met zijn bek in den rug van den hond, die
jankend en jammerend wegvluchtte.
Klaas lachte, Nele insgelijks en Soetkin keek gedurig naar de straat
of Uilenspiegel niet afkwam.
Eensklaps sprak zij:
--Daar is de provoost met vier sergeanten. 't Is toch zeker niet voor
ons. Twee van de mannen loopen de hut om.
Klaas hief zijn hoofd op.
--En de twee anderen blijven staan voor de deur, vervolgde Soetkin.
Klaas stond recht.
--Wien gaat men hier vangen? sprak zij. Jezus God! man, zij komen
hier binnen.
Klaas sprong van de keuken in den hof, gevolgd door Nele en zei:
--Red de karolussen, ze steken achter den brandmuur van den
schoorsteen.
Nele begreep hem: toen zag ze dat hij over de haag sprong, dat de
serjanten hem bij den kraag vatten, dat hij worstelde om los te
geraken en zij weende en riep:
--Hij is onschuldig! hij is onschuldig! doet geen kwaad aan Klaas, aan
mijn vader! Uilenspiegel, waar zijt gij? Gij zoudt ze den kop inslaan!
En zij sprong naar een der serjanten en reet zijn gezicht met
heure nagelen vaneen. En zij riep: Zij gaan hem dooden! en zij viel
machteloos op het gras van den hof.
Op het gerucht kwam Katelijne toegeloopen, en stijf en onbeweeglijk
aanzag zij het schouwspel.
--Het vuur! het vuur! Maakt open: de ziel wil er uit!
Soetkin onkundig van hetgeen er gebeurde, sprak op vroolijken toon
tot de serjanten, die binnengekomen waren:
--Mijne heeren, wien zoekt gij hier in deze arme woning? Als 't mijn
zoon is, die is verre. Hebt gij lange beenen?
Doch op dit oogenblik schreeuwde Nele om hulp; Soetkin liep in den
hof. Daar zag zij heuren man tegenspartelend medegesleept door de
beide serjanten.
--Sla ze dood! riep zij. Uilenspiegel waar zijt gij?
En zij wilde heuren man ter hulp komen, maar een der serjanten greep
heur vast, niet zonder moeite.
Klaas verweerde zich zoo geducht, dat hij ware ontsnapt, hadden de
twee andere serjanten hunne gezellen de hand niet geleend.
En, met de handen gebonden, brachten ze hem terug naar de keuken,
waar Soetkin en Nele heete tranen weenden en snikten.
--Heer provoost, sprak Soetkin, wat heeft mijn arme man gedaan,
dat gij hem bindt als een dief?
--Ketter, sprak een der serjanten.
--Ketter? hernam Soetkin, zijt gij een ketter, gij? Die duivels liegen!
--Ik stel mijn vertrouwen op God, antwoordde Klaas.
Hij werd buitengeleid; Nele en Soetkin volgden hem weenend, in den
waan dat zij ook voor den rechter moesten verschijnen. Mannen en
vrouwlieden kwamen bij heur; maar als zij hoorden dat Klaas opgeleid
werd onder verdenking van ketterije, kregen zij zulken schrik dat zij
haastelijk weer in huis liepen en de deuren toededen. Alleen eenige
meisjes dorsten bij Klaas komen en hem vragen:
--Waar gaat gij alzoo gekoord en gebonden, kooldrager?
--Op Gods genade, meidekens, antwoordde hij.
--Men bracht hem naar het Steen; Soetkin en Nele zetten zich neer
aan de poort. Als het avond werd, zei Soetkin tot Nele te gaan zien
of Uilenspiegel niet teruggekomen was.
LXIX.
Weldra liep de mare in de omliggende dorpen, dat een man gevangengezet
was uit hoofde van ketterije en dat de kettermeester Titelman, deken
van Ronse, bijgenaamd de Inquisiteur Zonder Genade, het onderzoek
zou bestieren.
Uilenspiegel verbleef toen te Koolkerke, in de beste vriendschap met
een schoone pachterse, een jonge weduwe die hem niets weigeren kon
van hetgeen heur eigendom was. Hij werd daar gevierd en geliefkoosd,
tot op den dag dat een verraderlijke medeminnaar, een schepene der
gemeente, hem in den morgen afwachtte als hij uit de taveerne kwam
en hem afrossen wilde. Maar Uilenspiegel, om zijne woede te stillen,
smeet hem in een vijver, waaruit de schepene met de grootste moeite
klaveren kon, groen als een kikvorsch en nat als een spons.
Uilenspiegel duchtte de weerwraak van den schepene en maakte dat hij
zoo gauw mogelijk uit Koolkerke kwam.
En hij liep regelrecht naar Damme.
De avond viel: hij hadde thuis willen zijn; in zijnen geest zag
hij Nele zitten naaien, Soetkin het avondmaal bereiden, Klaas zijne
mutsaards binden en Titus Bibulus Snuffius knagen aan een been.
Een rondleurder vroeg hem in 't voorbijgaan:
--Waar loopt gij zoo haastig?
--Naar Damme, naar mijn huis, was 't antwoord van Uilenspiegel.
De rondleurder sprak:
--De stad is niet meer veilig, ter oorzake van de ketteren die men
er pakt.
En hij ging voort.
Aan de afspanning het Roode Schild gekomen, ging Uilenspiegel er
binnen, om een glas dobbele kuite te drinken.
De baas zei hem:
--Zijt gij de zoon van Klaas niet?
--Die ben ik, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Haast u, sprak de baas, want het uur van rampspoed is voor uwen
vader geslagen.
Uilenspiegel vroeg wat hij zeggen wilde.
De baas antwoordde, dat hij het ongelukkiglijk maar al te gauw
zou weten.
En Uilenspiegel liep voort.
Toen hij Damme binnen kwam, liepen de honden die op de zullen der
deuren zaten, hem keffend en blaffend achterna. Op dat gerucht kwamen
de vrouwen buiten en allen vroegen hem te gelijk:
--Van waar komt gij? Hebt gij nieuws van uwen ongelukkigen vader? Waar
is uwe arme moeder? Zit zij ook in het Steen? Laas! als zij hem maar
niet levend verbranden!
Uilenspiegel liep nog harder.
Hij kwam Nele tegen, die hem zegde:
--Thijl, ga niet naar huis: die van de stad hebben er een bewaker
gesteld van wege den keizer.
Uilenspiegel bleef staan.
--Nele, sprak hij, is 't waar dat zij Klaas, mijn vader in 't gevang
hebben gestoken?
--Ja, sprak Nele, en Soetkin weent aan de poort van het Steen.
Het hert van den verloren zoon bonsde van smerte en hij zei tot Nele:
--Ik wil ze zien.
--Neen, dat moet gij niet doen, sprak Nele, maar wel volbrengen hetgeen
Klaas gezegd heeft, vóóraleer hij gepakt werd: Red de karolussen,
zij steken achter den brandmuur van den schoorsteen. Die moet gij
eerst redden, want zij zijn 't erfdeel van Soetkin, van de arme vrouwe.
Uilenspiegel luisterde niet, maar liep tot aan de poort van het
Steen. Daar vond hij Soetkin zitten; hij kuste heur snikkend en zij
weenden beiden. Door hun jammeren was het volk in menigte naar 't
gevang toegeloopen. Maar de serjanten kwamen, en verjoegen de arme
Soetkin en Uilenspiegel.
Moeder en zoon gingen toen naar het huis van Nele, naast hunne
woonstee, vóór dewelke zij een der landsknechten zagen, die men uit
Brugge ontboden had, uit vreeze voor de onlusten, die tijdens de
uitspraak en gedurende de lijfstraf konden uitbreken. Want Klaas werd
geerne gezien door de burgers van Damme.
De soldenier zat vóór de deur, en zoog de laatste droppelen uit eene
bottel brandewijn. Toen zij ledig was, smeet hij ze waar ze vliegen
wilde. Vervolgens trok hij zijn jachtmes en stak hij kasseien uit.
Snikkend kwam Soetkin bij Katelijne binnen.
En schuddebollend sprak Katelijne: "Het vuur! Maakt open, mijne ziel
wil er uit!"
LXX.
De burgstorm had geluid om de rechters ter vierschare te roepen;
omtrent vier uren zaten zij rond den boom der justitie.
Klaas werd vóór hen geleid en hij zag onder het verhemelte den Baljuw
van Damme zitten; aan zijne zijden waren de drossaard, de schepenen
en de griffier.
Op het geluid van de klokke kwam het gemeen in groote menigte
toegeloopen, en het sprak:
--Vele onder de rechters zitten daar niet om naar recht te vonnissen,
maar als slaven in dienst van den Keizer.
De griffier verklaarde dat de rechtbank zich voorafgaandelijk
ter vierschare rond den lindeboom vergaderd hebbende, beslist had
dat, gehoord de aantijgingen en getuigenissen, de genaamde Klaas,
koolbrander, geboortig van Damme, echtgenoot van Soetkin, dochter van
Joostens, bij den lijve moest gevat worden. En nu, voegde hij er bij,
gaan wij tot het verhoor der getuigen over.
Hans Barbier, buurman van Klaas, werd eerst onderhoord. Nadat hij den
eed afgelegd had, sprak hij: "Op mijner ziele zaligheid bevestig en
verzeker ik dat Klaas, alhier tegenwoordig, door mij gekend is meer
dan vijftien jaar; dat hij altijd eerlijk geleefd heeft volgens de
wetten Onzer Moeder de Heilige Kerk; dat hij nooit smadelijk over
haar gesproken of bij mijn wete nooit eenigen ketter geherbergd heeft,
noch het boek van Luther verborgen, noch over gemeld boek gesproken,
noch iets gedaan dat hem in verdenking kan brengen, de wetten en
ordonnantiën van het keizerrijk overtreden te hebben. Zoo helpen mij
God en al zijne santen."
Jan Van Roosebeke werd vervolgens onderhoord en zei "dat, gedurende de
afwezigheid van Soetkin, vrouw van Klaas, hij verscheidene reizen in
het huis van den beschuldigde twee mannenstemmen had meenen te hooren
en dat hij dikwijls, na de avondklokken, in een kleine zolderkamer,
een licht en twee klappende mannen gezien had, waaronder Klaas. Wat
betreft te zeggen of de andere man al of niet een ketter was, dat kon
hij niet, daar hij hem van verre gezien had. Maar wat Klaas betreft,
vervolgde hij, in volle waarheid moet ik zeggen dat hij, sedert ik hem
ken, geregeld zijn Paschen houdt, op de groote heiligdagen Onzen Heere
ontvangt, en alle Zondagen naar de misse gaat, uitgenomen nochtans
dien van het Heilig Bloed en de volgende. Meerder weet ik niet. Zoo
helpen mij God en al zijne santen."
Ondervraagd of hij Klaas, in de taveerne den Blauwen Toren, geene
aflaten had zien verkoopen en met het vagevuur niet had hooren spotten,
antwoordde Jan Van Roosebeke dat Klaas inderdaad aflaten verkocht had,
maar zonder eenigerlei verachting of spotternije, en dat hij, Jan Van
Roosebeke, er van hem gekocht had gelijk ook Judocus Grijpstuiver,
de deken der vischverkoopers, had willen doen.
De baljuw maakte nu de feiten en punten bekend, uit hoofde waarvan
Klaas voor de vierschare gedaagd was en sprak:
--De aanbrenger, toevallig eens te Damme gebleven, ten einde zijn
geld te Brugge niet in slemperijen en braspartijen te verteren,
gelijk dit meer gebeurt bij deze heilige gelegenheid, stond in
pais een luchtje te scheppen aan zijne zulle, toen hij een man de
Reigerstraat zag ingaan. Klaas, den man ziende, ging hem tegen en
groette hem. De man was in 't zwart gekleed. Hij ging bij Klaas
binnen en de deur bleef half open. Nieuwgierig om te weten wie
die man was, ging de aanbrenger in de gang en hoorde Klaas met den
vreemdeling spreken over zekeren Judocus, zijn broeder, die, onder
de protestantsche troepen gevangengenomen, omtrent Aken geradbraakt
werd. De vreemdeling zei tot Klaas: aangezien het geld hetwelk
zijn broeder hem gegeven had, genomen was van het arme, onwetende
volk, hij het moest gebruiken om zijn zoon op te brengen in den
hervormden eeredienst. Ook zette hij Klaas aan om den schoot Onzer
Moeder de Heilige Kerk te verlaten, en nadat hij allerlei goddelooze
woorden uitgesproken had, antwoordde Klaas alleenlijk: De beulen! De
moordenaars! Mijn arme broeder! En dusdoende lasterde de beschuldigde
Onzen Heiligen Vader den Paus en Zijne Koninklijke Majesteit, omdat zij
de ketterije terecht willen straffen als eene misdaad van goddelijke
en menschelijke majesteitsschennis. Als de man gedaan had met eten,
hoorde de aanbrenger Klaas uitroepen: "Arme Judocus, dat God zich
uwer ontferme; zij waren wreed jegens u." Daardoor beschuldigde hij
God zelf van goddeloosheid, door te willen veronderstellen dat Hij
ketteren in zijnen hemel zou ontvangen. En Klaas hield niet op te
zeggen: "Mijn arme broeder!" Gelijk een kettersch predikant, riep
de vreemdeling toen in woede uit: "Zij zal vallen, de Babylonische
Hoer, en het verblijf worden van duivelen en roofdieren." Klaas
riep daarop: "De beulen, de moordenaars! Mijn arme broeder!" De
vreemdeling, zijne rede vervolgende, sprak: "Want de engel zal eenen
steen oprapen, zoo groot als een molensteen. En hij zal hem in de
zee smijten en zeggen: Zoo wordt het groot Babylon weggeworpen en
nimmermeer teruggevonden."--"Heer, sprak Klaas, uw mond is vol
grammoedigheid; maar zeg mij wanneer de heerschappij zal komen
in dewelke de zachtmoedigen in pais op de wereld zullen kunnen
leven?"--"Nooit! antwoordde de vreemdeling, zoolang de antichrist
regeert, dat is de paus, die een vijand van licht en waarheid
is."--"Ha! sprak Klaas, gij spreekt zonder eerbied van Onzen Heiligen
Vader. Hij is onwetend van de wreede folteringen waarmede de arme
protestanten gestraft worden." De vreemdeling antwoordde: "Zeker
weet hij het, want het is op zijne bevelen dat zij worden om hals
gebracht door den keizer, nu door den koning, die profijt trekt uit
de verbeurdverklaringen, die van de gestorvenen erft en juist liefst
de rijken uit hoofde van ketterije voor de Vierscharen daagt." Klaas
antwoordde: "Overal spreekt men ervan in Vlaanderenland, ik moet het
gelooven. Het vleesch des menschen is zwak, al is het ook koninklijk
vleesch. Mijn arme Judocus!" En Klaas gaf alzoo te verstaan dat het
uit een verachtelijk winstbejag is dat Zijne Majesteit de ketteren
doet straffen. Mits de vreemdeling wilde voortgaan, antwoordde Klaas:
"Gelief, Heere, met deze reden niet voort te gaan, want werden zij
gehoord, ik zou het duur moeten bekoopen."
... Klaas stond op om naar den kelder te gaan, waaruit hij met een
kan bier terugkwam: "Ik ga de deur toedoen", sprak hij vervolgens,
en de aanbrenger hoorde niets meer, want hij moest haastelijk het huis
verlaten. Maar met valavond werd de deur weer geopend. De vreemdeling
ging heen, maar weldra kwam hij weder kloppen, zeggende: "Klaas,
't is koud; ik weet niet waar slapen; verleen mij eene schuilplaats;
niemand heeft mij zien binnenkomen; alles is stil." Klaas liet hem
binnen, stak eene lanteerne aan en men zag hem,--den ketter den weg
wijzend,--de trap opgaan en den vreemdeling brengen in een kleine
dakkamer waarvan het venster uitzicht geeft in den hof.
--Wie anders, riep Klaas uit, kan dat alles overgedragen hebben dan
gij, deugniet van een vischverkooper? Stondt gij dien Zondag niet stijf
als een paal aan uwe zulle, schijnheilig naar de zwaluwen te kijken?
En hij wees naar Judocus Grijpstuiver, deken der vischverkoopers,
die met zijn leelijke tronie tusschen het volk te zien was.
De vischverkooper grijnslachte, toen hij hoorde dat Klaas aldus zich
zelven verried. Allen die van 't gemeen, mannen, vrouwen en meidekens,
zeiden tot elkaar:
--Arme man, die woorden kosten hem het leven!
Doch de griffier ging voort:
--De ketter en Klaas spraken dien nacht en ook de zes volgende
nachten langdurig met elkander; men kon den vreemdeling vele gebaren
van dreigement of van zegening zien maken, de handen ten hemel zien
heffen, als zijne gelijken in ketterije plegen te doen. Klaas scheen
zijne reden goed te keuren. Voorzeker spraken zij die dagen, avonden
en nachten smadelijk over de misse, de biecht, de aflaten en Zijne
Koninklijke Majesteit....
--Niemand heeft dat gehoord, sprak Klaas, en zonder bewijzen mag men
mij daarvan niet beschuldigen!
De griffier hernam:--Men heeft andere dingen gehoord. Als de
vreemdeling den zevenden dag omtrent den valavond vertrok, hebt
gij hem uitgeleide gedaan tot aan den paalsteen van Katelijne's
akker. Daar vroeg de vreemdeling u wat gij gedaan hadt met de leelijke
afgodenbeelden--en de baljuw sloeg een kruis--van de Allerheiligste
Maagd, van Sint-Nikolaas en van Sint-Maarten? Gij antwoordet dat
gij ze gebroken en in den put gesmeten hadt. Zij werden inderdaad,
verleden nacht, in uwen put gevonden, en de stukken ervan liggen in
de folterkamer.
Op die rede scheen Klaas verstomd. De baljuw vroeg hem of hij niets
te antwoorden had; Klaas zegde van neen.
De baljuw vroeg hem of hij de vermaledijde gedachte niet herroepen
wilde, die hem de beelden had doen breken, alsmede de goddelooze doling
dewelke hem smadelijke woorden ten opzichte van Zijne Goddelijke
Majesteit en ten opzichte van Zijne Koninklijke Majesteit had doen
uitspreken.
Klaas antwoordde dat zijn lijf aan Zijne Koninklijke Majesteit,
maar dat zijn geweten aan Christus behoorde, wiens wet hij wilde
opvolgen. De baljuw vroeg hem of die wet diegene van de Heilige
Kerk was.
--Zij staat geschreven in de Heilige Schrift, antwoordde Klaas.
Aangemaand te antwoorden op de vraag of de Paus de Stadhouder van
Christus op dees aarde is, sprak hij:
--Neen!
--Ondervraagd of hij geloofde dat het verboden was de beelden van
de Heilige Maagd en van de Heiligen te aanbidden, antwoordde hij,
dat het afgoderij was. Ondervraagd over het stuk of de oorbiecht goed
is en heilzaam, antwoordde hij:
--Christus heeft gezegd: Belijdt uwe zonden aan malkander.
Hij was kloekmoedig in zijne antwoorden, hoewel hij in den grond
treurig en angstig scheen.
Acht uren had de klok geslagen en de avond viel: de heeren der
rechtbank stelden de uitspraak uit tot den volgenden dag.
LXXI.
In Katelijne's hut weende Soetkin, waanzinnig van smerte. En gedurig
sprak zij:
--Mijn man! mijn arme man!
Uilenspiegel en Nele omhelsden heur met oneindige teederheid. Zij
drukte hen toen in heure armen en weende in stilte. Dan deed zij hun
teeken heur alleen te laten. Nele sprak tot Uilenspiegel:
--Laat heur, zij wil het; wij zullen de karolussen redden.
En zij togen henen; Katelijne liep rond Soetkin en sprak:
Maak open: mijne ziel wil er uit!
En Soetkin, met strakke oogen, keek heur aan zonder heur te zien.
De hutten van Klaas en van Katelijne paalden aaneen, die van Klaas
stond wat achteruit en had een hofje van voren. Bij het huisje van
Katelijne hoorde een boonenveld, dat op de straat uitgaf. Dat veld
was afgesloten met een groene haag, waarin Uilenspiegel en Nele,
toen ze jong waren, een gat gemaakt hadden, om bij malkander te komen.
Uilenspiegel en Nele gingen in het boonenveld en van daar zagen zij
den landsknecht welke, met waggelenden kop in de lucht spuwde, maar
het speeksel viel terug op zijn wambuis. Een flesch lag nevens hem.
--Nele, sprak Uilenspiegel stille, die dronken soldaat heeft niet
genoeg gedronken, hij moet nog meer drinken. Eerst dan zullen wij
hem meester zijn. Laat ons de flesch nemen.
Bij den klank hunner stemmen, keerde de soldenier zijn zwaren kop
naar hen toe; hij zocht zijne flesch en, die niet vindende, spuwde hij
voort in de lucht om in den maneschijn zijn speeksel te zien vallen.
--De brandewijn zit tot aan zijne tanden, sprak Uilenspiegel, ziet gij,
Nele, hoe moeilijk hij spuwt?
Als de soldenier opnieuw gespuwd en in de lucht gekeken had, stak hij
de hand uit naar de flesch. Hij vond ze, zette ze aan zijn mond, stak
zijn hoofd achteruit, klopte zachtjes op de flesch om er de laatste
droppelen uit te halen en lokte er aan als een kind aan de borst
zijner moeder. Er niets meer in vindende, smeet hij de flesch weg,
vloekte toen in het Hoogduitsch, spuwde weer, liet den kop rechts en
links vallen, knauwde een onverstaanbaar vaderons en sliep in.
Uilenspiegel, die begreep dat die slaap niet van langen duur wezen
zou, zegde dat zij hem nog zwaarder moesten doen ronken; hij kroop
door de haag, nam de flesch van den dronkenlap, gaf ze aan Nele,
die ze met brandewijn vulde.
De soldaat snorkte door; Uilenspiegel kroop weder door het gat van
de haag, stak de volle flesch tusschen de beenen van den dronkaard
en keerde terug in het boonenveld, waar hij met Nele bleef wachten.
De koelte van de versch gevulde flesch deed den soldaat de oogen
openen, en onwillekeurig tastte hij naar het voorwerp, dat hem koude
veroorzaakte.
Zijn dronkaards-instinct zei hem, dat het wel eene volle flesch kon
wezen, en hij greep ze vast. Uilenspiegel zag hem, in den maneschijn,
de flesch schudden om te hooren of er iets in was, er van proeven,
lachen en verwonderd zijn dat zij zoo vol was, dan een slok drinken,
de flesch neerzetten, weernemen en nog drinken.
Toen zong hij:
    Komt in 't blauw heer Maneschijn
    's Avonds bij vrouw Zee....
Bij de Hoogduitschers is vrouwe Zee de gemalinne van heer Maan,
die de meester der vrouwen is. Hij zong dus:
    Komt in 't blauw heer Maneschijn
    's Avonds bij vrouw Zee,
    Vrouwe Zee dan biedt hem aan
    Heet haar grooten roemer wijn,
    Komt in 't blauw heer Maneschijn.
    Met hem zal ze aan tafel gaan,
    Om zijn hals haar armen slaan,
    En is 't rijke maal gedaan,
    In haar bed hem liggen gaan,
    Komt in 't blauw de heere Maan.
    Dien' me zoo mijn lievekijn,
    Lekker eten, heeten wijn,
    Dien' me zoo mijn lievekijn,
    Komt in 't blauw heer Maneschijn.
Na elk referein nam hij een slok en na het laatste ledigde hij de
flesch. En toen viel hij in slaap. En hij hoorde niet dat Nele zegde:
"Ze steken in eenen pot achter den brandmuur van den schoorsteen",
noch dat Uilenspiegel langs het stalleken in de keuken van Klaas
drong. Uilenspiegel hief de plaat van den brandmuur op, nam den pot en
de karolussen en ging toen de karolussen begraven naast den steenput
van Katelijne, daar hij wel wist dat men ze misschien in den put,
doch geenszins er nevens zou zoeken.
Vervolgens keerden zij terug bij Soetkin, die weende en zuchtte:
--Mijn man! mijne arme man!
Nele en Uilenspiegel bleven heel den nacht bij heur waken.
LXXII.
Den volgenden dag riep de burgstorm de rechters ter vierschare.
Als zij op de vier banken rond den boom der justitie zaten,
onderhoorden zij nogmaals Klaas en vroegen hem of hij zijne dolingen
wilde herroepen.
Klaas hief de handen ten hemel en sprak:
--Christus, mijn Heer, ziet mij van omhoog. Ik bekeek de zonne toen
mijn Thijl ter wereld kwam. Waar is hij nu, de zwerver? Soetkin,
mijn goede, mijn zoete vrouwe, zult gij kloekmoedig zijn in 't ongeluk?
Toen bezag hij den lindeboom en vloekte hij hem:
--Storm en droogte! dat de boomen van den grond onzer vaderen liever
verschroeien dan te gedogen, dat men in hunne schaduw het vrije
geweten ten dood verwijst! Waar zijt gij, mijn jongen? Ik was hard
jegens u Mijne Heeren, ontfermt U mijner, en oordeelt mij gelijk Onze
Goedertieren Heere zou doen.
En allen die hem aanhoorden, moesten weenen, behalve de rechters en
Judocus Grijpstuiver.
Toen vroeg hij of er voor hem geenerlei vergiffenis was, zeggende:
--Ik heb altijd veel gewrocht en weinig gewonnen; ik was goed jegens
den arme en gedienstig voor elkeen. Ik heb de Roomsche Kerke verlaten
om te gehoorzamen aan den geest Gods, die tot mij sprak. Ik smeek om
geen andere gratie dan de verandering van de straffe des vuurs in die
van eeuwigdurende verbanning uit Vlaanderenland, op verbeurte mijns
levens, straffe die voorwaar streng genoeg is.
Allen riepen:
--Genade, heeren! erbarming!
Maar Judocus Grijpstuiver riep niet mede.
De baljuw gaf de toehoorders teeken te zwijgen en zegde dat het door
de plakkaten strengelijk verboden was, genade voor ketteren te vragen,
maar dat, zoo Klaas zijne doling wilde afzweren, hij zou gehangen
worden in stee van verbrand.
En het volk sprak:
--Gehangen of verbrand, 't is toch de dood!
En de vrouwen weenden en de mannen morden.
--Ik zweer niets af, sprak Klaas. Doet met mijn lijf wat uwer genade
zal believen.
Titelman, de deken van Ronse, riep toen uit:
--Het is ondraaglijk zulk een kettergespuis tot zijne rechters het
hoofd te zien verheffen; het lichaam tot assche verbranden is een
kortstondige pijne; men moet de ziele redden en de ketteren, door
middel van de torture, dwingen hunne dolingen af te gaan, opdat zij
aan 't volk het gevaarlijk schouwspel niet geven van ketteren, die
in onboetveerdigheid sterven.
Op die rede weenden de vrouwen nog meer en zeiden de mannen:
--Hij heeft het stuk bekend: 't is dus de straffe, maar niet de
torture.
De rechtbank besliste dat, mits de tortuur niet voorgeschreven was
door de ordonnantiën, Klaas die niet moest verduren. Nogmaals tot
afzweren vermaand, antwoordde hij:
--Ik kan niet.
Krachtens de plakkaten, werd hij plichtig verklaard aan simonie,
wegens het verkoopen van aflaten, aan ketterije en aan het herbergen
van ketters en als dusdanig werd hij veroordeeld om "geëxecuteerd
te worden met den viere, zoo dat er de dood naar volge", vóór de pui
van het schepenhuis.
Zijn lichaam zou twee dagen aan den staak blijven hangen om tot
voorbeeld te dienen en daarna gevoerd worden ter plaatse patibulaire,
zooals zij het galgeveld heetten.
De rechtbank kende den aanbrenger Judocus Grijpstuiver--wiens' naam
niet genoemd werd--vijftig gulden op de eerste honderd karolusgulden
der erfenis en den tienden penning op het overige toe.
Als Klaas dat vonnis hoorde, sprak hij tot den deken der
vischverkoopers:
--Gij zult een kwaden dood sterven, slecht mensch, die voor een kleine
som gelds eene weduw en eenen wees, twee ongelukkigen maakt.
De rechters hadden Klaas laten uitspreken, want zij ook--behalve
Titelman--voelden groote verachting voor den deken der vischverkoopers
en zijne eerlooze aanklacht.
Grijpstuiver was bleek van woede en van schaamte.
En Klaas werd terug naar het Steen gebracht.
LXXIII.
Den volgenden dag, werd het vonnis aan Nele, Uilenspiegel en Soetkin
bekend gemaakt.
Zij vroegen den rechters om in het gevang te mogen gaan, hetwelk hun
toegestaan werd, behalve aan Nele.
Als zij binnenkwamen, zagen zij Klaas met een keten aan den muur
geklonken. Een klein houtvuur smeulde in den heerd, ter oorzake van de
wakheid. Want bij wet en recht is het in Vlaanderen voorgeschreven,
goed te zijn voor hen die moeten sterven, en hun brood, vleesch of
kaas, alsmede wijn te geven. Maar de schrokkige cipiers overtreden
dikwijls de wet, en talrijk zijn zij, die het grootste en beste deel
van het eten der arme gevangenen achterhouden.
Weenend vloog Klaas om den hals van Uilenspiegel en Soetkin, maar
hij was de eerste die ophield met weenen, want hij wilde sterk zijn,
als man en als hoofd van het huis.
Soetkin snikte en Uilenspiegel sprak:
--Kon ik die ijzers breken.
Soetkin snikte en sprak:
--Ik zal bij koning Philippus gaan, hij zal genade verleenen.
Klaas antwoordde:
--De koning erft van de martelaren.
Dan voegde hij er bij:
--Lieve vrouw en kind! treurig en smertvol ga ik deze wereld
verlaten. Zoo ik eenigen schrik koester voor het lijden mijns
lichaams, ben ik mede bedroefd als ik er aan denk dat, als ik dood
ben, gij beiden arm en ellendig zult zijn, want de koning zal u uwe
have ontnemen.
Uilenspiegel antwoordde met stille stemme:
--Gisteren heb ik met Nele alles gered.
--Dat doet mij genoegen, antwoordde Klaas; de aanbrenger zal niet
lachen op mijn lijk.
--Hij sterve, de judas, sprak Soetkin met haatvollen blik.
Maar Klaas dacht aan de karolussen en sprak:
--Dat was slim van u, Thijlken, mijn lieveling; Soetkin, mijn arme
Soetkin, zal dus in haren ouden dag geen honger hoeven te lijden.
En Klaas omhelsde heur, drukte heur tegen zijne borst, en zij snikte
nog harder, bij de gedachte dat zij weldra heuren braven beschermer
zou kwijt zijn.
Klaas bezag Uilenspiegel en sprak:
--Mijn zoon, dikwijls deedt gij kwaad, door langs de wegen te
slenteren als de rabauwen; dat moogt gij nimmermeer doen, mijn kind,
noch uw moeder alleen laten, want gij, als man, moet heur beschermer
en verdediger zijn.
--Dat zal ik, vader, sprak Uilenspiegel.
--O mijn arme man! zei Soetkin hem kussend. Welke misdaad bedreven wij
dan? Wij leefden getweeën gelukkig in eere en in deugd; wij beminden
elkander, dat weet gij, Heere God, die ons ziet! Wij stonden vroeg
op om te werken en 's avonds aten wij, U dankend, het zuur gewonnen
brood van den dag. Ik ga naar den koning; ik zal hem verscheuren met
mijne nagelen. Heere God, wij hebben niets misdaan!
Maar de cipier kwam binnen en zei dat ze moesten vertrekken.
Soetkin vroeg om te blijven. Klaas voelde heur arm gezicht branden
tegen het zijne, en de tranen van Soetkin maakten zijne wangen nat,
en heel heur lichaam trilde en huiverde in zijne armen. Hij vroeg om
heur bij hem te laten.
De cipier zei nog dat ze moesten henengaan en trok Soetkin uit de
armen van Klaas.
Klaas sprak tot Uilenspiegel:
--Waak over haar.
Uilenspiegel beloofde het hem. En de zoon de moeder ondersteunend,
togen Uilenspiegel en Soetkin henen.
LXXIV.
Den volgenden dag, die de dag van de lijfstraffe was, namen de buren
uit medelijden, Uilenspiegel, Soetkin en Nele mede naar Katelijne's
huis en sloten hen op.
Maar zij hadden er niet aan gedacht, dat zij van verre de kreten
van den martelaar hooren en, door het venster, de vlammen van den
brandstapel zien konden.
Schuddebollend dwaalde Katelijne door de stad, roepende:
--Maakt open: de ziel wil er uit!
Te negen uren werd Klaas in zijn hemde, met de handen op den rug
gebonden, uit de gevangenis gehaald. Volgens de sententie, was de
brandstapel opgericht in de Onze-Lieve-Vrouwestraat, rondom een staak,
die vóór de pui van 't schepenhuis geplaatst was. De beul en zijne
knechten waren nog bezig met het hout opeen te stapelen.
Klaas, omringd door zijne serjanten, wachtte geduldig, terwijl de
provoost te peerd, de staffieren van 't baljuwschap en de negen uit
Brugge ontboden landsknechten groote moeite hadden om het morrende
volk tegen te houden.
Allen zeiden dat het wreedheid was een man, die steeds goed, gedienstig
en neerstig was, in zijn ouden dag aldus te martelen.
Doch eensklaps knielden zij neder om te bidden. De doodklok begon
te kleppen.
De uitzinnige Katelijne stond vooraan in het volk.
Naar Klaas en den brandstapel kijkend, sprak zij:
--Het vuur! Het vuur! Maakt een gat: de ziel wil er uit.
Als Soetkin en Nele de klokke hoorden, sloegen beiden een kruis. Maar
Uilenspiegel deed het niet, zeggende dat hij God niet aanbad op de
manier van de beulen. De hut rondloopend, beproefde hij deuren en
vensteren open te breken, maar de buren, die buiten stonden, beletten
het hem.
Doch Soetkin sloeg eensklaps heur voorschoot vóór heur gezicht
en gilde:
--De rook!
De drie bedroefden zagen een groote zwarte rookwolk dwarrelend omhoog
stijgen. 't Was de rook van den brandstapel, waarop Klaas aan eenen
staak was gebonden en dien de scherprechter aan drie kanten aangestoken
had, in naam des Vaders, des Zoons en des Heiligen Geestes.
Klaas keek rond zich, en als hij Soetkin en Uilenspiegel in de menigte
niet zag, was hij tevreden dat zij hem niet zouden zien lijden.
Klaas bad, het hout knetterde, de mannen morden, de vrouwen weenden,
Katelijne sprak:--Doet het vuur uit, maakt een gat, de ziel wil er
uit,--en de doodklok klepte, en ander gerucht hoorde men niet.
Soetkin werd eensklaps bleek als de dood, zij huiverde over gansch
heur lichaam en wees naar den hemel. Een lange, smalle vlam was uit
den brandstapel opgestegen en verhief zich bijwijlen boven de daken
van de lage huizen. De vlam was bitter smertelijk voor Klaas, want al
naar gelang van de grillen des winds, knaagde zij aan zijne beenen,
verschroeidde en verbrandde zij zijn haar en zijnen baard.
Uilenspiegel drukte Soetkin in zijne armen en wilde heur van voor
het venster trekken. Zij hoorden een bangen kreet: 't was Klaas,
wiens lichaam aan eenen kant brandde. Maar hij zweeg en weende. En
zijne borst was nat van zijne tranen.
Toen hoorden Soetkin en Uilenspiegel een groot rumoer. 't Waren de
poorters, vrouwen en kinderen die riepen:
--Klaas werd niet veroordeeld om te sterven met zacht vuur, maar met
groote vlammen. Beul, pook het vuur aan!
De beul deed het, doch het vuur wilde niet laaien.
--Verworg hem, riepen zij.
En zij smeten steenen naar den provoost.
--De vlam! de groote vlam! huilde Soetkin.
Te midden van den rook, zag zij nu een roode vlam ten hemel stijgen.
--Hij gaat sterven, sprak de weduw. God, ontferm U der ziele van
den onschuldigen martelaar. Waar is de koning, dat ik hem met mijne
nagelen het hert uitrukke?
En de doodklok klepte.
Soetkin hoorde Klaas nog een grooten kreet slaken, maar zij zag noch
zijn lichaam dat zich wrong en kronkelde door de smerte des vuurs,
noch zijn gezicht dat ineentrok, zijn hoofd dat hij langs alle kanten
keerde en draaide en tegen den staak sloeg. Het volk ging voort met
roepen en fluiten, de vrouwen en kinderen smeten nog steenen, toen
plotseling heel de brandstapel ontgloeide, en allen, te midden van
rook en van vlammen, Klaas hoorden zuchten:
--Soetkin! Thijl!
En zijn hoofd viel op zijne borst alsof het van lood was.
En uit Katelijne's woning kwam een schellen, hertverscheurenden
kreet. En toen hoorde men niets meer dan de uitzinnige, die
schuddebollend sprak: "De ziel wil er uit".
Klaas was dood. De brandstapel viel ineen aan den voet van den staak,
aan denwelken het arme, verkoolde lichaam bij den hals bleef hangen.
En de doodklep klepte.
LXXV.
Met gebogen hoofd en gevouwen handen stond Soetkin zwijgend tegen
den muur van den keuken. En Uilenspiegel had zijne armen om heuren
hals geslagen, zonder spreken of weenen.
Hij was verschrikt van het koortsvuur dat in zijn moeders lichaam
brandde.
De buren, die terugkwamen, zeiden dat Klaas gedaan had met lijden.
--Hij is in den hemel, sprak de weduw.
--Bid voor hem, sprak Nele tot Uilenspiegel, en zij gaf hem heuren
rozenkrans; maar hij stiet dien van zich af, omdat, zoo hij zeide,
de bollekens door den paus gewijd waren.
De nacht was gevallen en Uilenspiegel zei:
--Moeder, ga slapen, ik zal bij u waken.
--Gij moet niet waken, sprak Soetkin, want de slaap doet goed aan
jonge menschen.
Nele maakte hun elk eene legerstee in de keuken en ging toen henen.
En zij bleven er getweeën, terwijl het vuur van de wortels in den
heerd uitbrandde.
Soetkin ging slapen, Uilenspiegel deed als zij en hoorde ze weenen
in heur bedde.
Buiten, in de nachtelijke stilte, deed de wind de boomen huilen lijk
de zee en joeg, als voorboden van den herfst, dwarrelende stofwolken
tegen de ruiten.
Het scheen Uilenspiegel dat hij een man zag over en weer gaan, dat
hij stappen hoorde in de keuken. Toen hij opkeek, zag hij den man
niet meer; maar hij luisterde en hoorde alleen den wind, die in den
schoorsteen huilde en Soetkin, die in heur bedde weende.
Dan opnieuw hoorde hij stappen, en, achter zich, tegen zijn hoofd,
een bangen zucht.--Wie is daar? sprak hij.
Niemand antwoordde, maar hij hoorde drie kloppen op de
tafel. Uilenspiegel, verschrikt en huiverend, vroeg nogmaals:--Wie is
daar? Hij kreeg geen antwoord, maar hoorde drie kloppen op de tafel
en voelde twee armen die hem vastgrepen, en over zijn gelaat zich
een ruig lichaam buigen, dat een groot gat in de borst had en naar
verbrand rook.
--Vader, sprak Uilenspiegel, is het uw arm lichaam, dat aldus op
mij drukt?
Hij kreeg geen antwoord, en, hoewel de schimme omtrent hem was,
hoorde hij buiten roepen: "Thijl! Thijl!" Soetkin stond schielijk op
en kwam aan Uilenspiegel's bed. "Hoort gij niets?" vroeg zij hem.
--'t Doet, vader die mij roept.
Ik, sprak Soetkin, ik heb een koud lichaam in mijn bedde gevoeld;
en de stroozakken schudden en de gordijnen gingen open en toe en
'k hoorde eene stemme die sprak: "Soetkin"; eene stemme die zwak
als een ademtocht was, en stappen zoo licht als het dansen der
muggen. Vervolgens tot den Geest van Klaas sprekend, zegde zij:
"Man, zoo gij iets begeert in den hemel alwaar God U opgenomen heeft,
moet gij het zeggen, opdat wij uwen wil kunnen volbrengen."
Eensklaps sloeg de wind met geweld de deur open en de kamer werd
met stof vervuld, en Uilenspiegel en Soetkin hoorden in de verte een
akelig ravengekras.
Zij kwamen samen buiten en gingen naar den brandstapel.
Het was stikdonker, behalve wanneer de gure Noordenwind de wolken in
den hemel als herten voortjoeg en de bleeke maan heur zilveren licht
ter aarde zond.
Een stadsserjant stond op wacht bij den brandstapel. Soetkin en
Uilenspiegel hoorden den klank zijner stappen op den harden grond en
het gekras eener raaf, die zekere raven bijriep, want het werd in de
verte beantwoord door andere raven.
Als Uilenspiegel en Soetkin bij den brandstapel waren, viel de raaf
op Klaas' schouderen neer, en zij hoorden heur pikken in het lijk,
en andere raven vlogen weldra bij.
Uilenspiegel wilde op den brandstapel springen om de raven te verjagen;
de serjant sprak tot hem:
--Tooveraar, 't is nuttelooze moeite die gij doen gaat, weet dat de
handen van verbranden het vermogen niet hebben onzichtbaar te maken
als die van gehangenen.
--Heer serjant, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, ik ben geen tooveraar, maar
de wees van hem die daar hangt, en deze vrouw is zijne weduwe. Wij
willen hem nogmaals kussen en een weinig van zijne assche meenemen,
tot gedenkenis. Laat het ons toe, heer, gij die geen vreemd soldenier,
maar een zoon van Vlaanderen zijt.
--Doet als gij vraagt, antwoordde de serjant.
De wees en de weduw klommen op het verkoold hout en kwamen bij het
lijk; weenend kusten zij Klaas zijn gezicht.
Ter plaats van het hert, waar de vlam een groot gat had geknaagd, nam
Uilenspiegel een weinig asch van den doode. Vervolgens nederknielend,
begonnen zij te bidden. En toen de ochtendschemering de kimmen lichtte,
zaten beiden daar nog; doch de sergeant deed hen heengaan, uit vreeze
voor straf.
Thuis, nam Soetkin een stukje roode en een stukje zwarte zijde; zij
maakte een zakje van, in hetwelk zij de assche stak; en zij naaide
twee linten aan het zakje, opdat Uilenspiegel het om den hals kon
dragen. Zij langde hem het zakje en sprak:
--Dat deze assche, die het hert van mijn man is, dit rood, dat zijn
bloed is, dit zwart, dat onze rouw is, steeds op uwe borst blijve,
als een vuur van wrake voor zijne beulen!
--Dat zal, zwoer Uilenspiegel.
En de weduw kuste den wees, en de zonne stond op.
LXXVI.
's Anderen daags kwamen de serjanten en omroepers der gemeente in de
hut van Klaas, om al het huisraad op straat te brengen en publiek te
verkoopen. Van uit Katelijne's huis zag Soetkin de wieg van ijzer en
kooper beneden komen die, van vader tot zoon, altijd in Klaas' huis
was geweest, waarin de arme doode geboren was en ook Uilenspiegel ter
wereld kwam. Vervolgens bracht men ook het bedde beneden, in hetwelk
Soetkin heuren zoon had ontvangen. En vervolgens de schapraai, en
de ketels, pateelen en potten, die niet meer blonken lijk weleer,
maar nu vuil van het stof waren.
En ook eene tonne enkele en een klein vaatje dobbele kuite en, in
een groote mande, ten minste dertig flesschen wijn; en alles werd op
straat gezet, tot den laatsten stoel uit het huis.
Met bloedend herte, doch zonder klagen, zag zij zich heur nederigen
rijkdom, alle die herinneringen van vroeger, alle die vrienden
ontnemen. De omroeper stak de keers aan en het huisraad werd stuk
voor stuk verkocht. De keers was bijkans op, als de deken der
vischverkoopers alles tegen een spotprijs gekocht had om het voort
te verkoopen. Hij scheen vergenoegd als een wezel, die de hersenen
eener henne uitzuigt.
Uilenspiegel zei in zich zelven: "Gij zult niet blijven lachen,
moordenaar."
De verkoop was gedaan en nochtans bleven de serjanten overal zoeken,
zonder de karolussen te vinden. De vischverkooper riep:
--Gij zoekt slecht: ik weet dat Klaas voor zes maanden zevenhonderd
karolussen bezat.
Uilenspiegel zei in zich zelven: "Gij zult niet erven, moordenaar."
Eensklaps keerde Soetkin zich naar hem en sprak, met den vinger naar
den vischverkooper wijzend:
--Dáár is de aanbrenger!
--Ik weet het, zei Uilenspiegel.
--Duldt gij, sprak zij, dat hij uws vaders bloed erve?
--Nog liever zat ik een heelen dag op de pijnbank, antwoordde
Uilenspiegel.
--Ik ook, sprak Soetkin, maar spreek niet uit medelijden, hoe groot
ook de smerte weze die ik lijde.
--Eilaas! gij zijt eene vrouwe, zei Uilenspiegel.
--Arme jongen, sprak Soetkin, ik bracht u ter wereld en kan tegen
't lijden. Maar gij, als ik u zag.... Vervolgens verbleekend: Ik zal
de Heilige Maagd bidden, die heuren zoon aan het kruis zag....
En zij weende, en kuste Uilenspiegel.
En aldus sloten zij een verdrag, dat hun haat en hunne kracht
versterkte.
LXXVII.
De vischverkooper moest maar de helft van de koopsom betalen, mits de
andere helft hem als aanbrenger toekwam, tot dat men de zevenhonderd
gouden karolussen vond, die hem tot zijn eerlooze daad aangezet hadden.
Soetkin weende 's nachts en werkte 's daags in het huishouden. Dikwijls
hoorde Uilenspiegel haar in zich zelve zeggen:
--Als hij erft, laat ik mij dooden.
Nele en hij, wisten dat zij doen zou wat zij zeide; zij deden hun
best om Soetkin te bewegen naar Walcheren te trekken, alwaar zij magen
had. Soetkin wilde niet, zeggende dat zij zich niet verwijderen wilde
van den bodem, die weldra heur gebeente zou ontvangen.
Ondertusschen ging de vischverkooper opnieuw tot den baljuw en zegde,
dat de aflijvige voor eenige maanden zevenhonderd karolussen geërfd
had, dat Klaas een spaarzam man was en dat hij dus die groote som
niet verteerd had, maar dat ze ergens verborgen moest zijn.
De baljuw vroeg hem wat kwaad Uilenspiegel en Soetkin hem hadden gedaan
om, na den eenen zijn vader en de andere heuren man te hebben ontnomen,
hen nu nog zoo wreedelijk te vervolgen.
De vischverkooper antwoordde dat hij, als hoogpoorter van Damme,
de wetten van den lande wilde doen eerbiedigen om 's keizers
goedertierenheid te verwerven.
Daarop liet hij in handen van den baljuw een geschrevene aanklacht en
hij bracht getuigen, die, in volle waarheid sprekende, huns ondanks
moesten bevestigen, dat de vischverkooper niet loog.
Op die getuigenissen verklaarden de heeren van de Schepenkamer,
dat de vermoedens van plichtigheid voldoende waren om de torture toe
te passen. Dienvolgens lieten zij het huis opnieuw afzoeken door de
serjanten, die last hadden moeder en zoon naar het Steen te brengen,
alwaar zij zouden opgesloten blijven, tot dat de scherprechter van
Brugge kwam, die men op staanden voet had ontboden.
Toen Soetkin en Uilenspiegel gekoord en gebonden door de straat kwamen,
stond de vischverkooper aan zijne deur naar hen te kijken.
En de poorters en poorteressen van Damme stonden ook aan hunne
deur. Mathijssen, de naaste gebuur van den vischverkooper, hoorde
Uilenspiegel tot den lafaard zeggen:
--Gij, die eene weduwe martelt, wordt gedoemd door den Heere!
En ook Soetkin, die zei:
--Gij, die eenen wees vervolgt, zult een kwaden dood sterven!
Toen die van Damme aldus vernomen hadden dat het op een tweede
aanklacht van Grijpstuiver was, dat men moeder en zoon naar 't gevang
bracht, jouwden zij den vischverkooper uit en smeten 's avonds steenen
in zijne ruiten. En zijne deur werd vol vuiligheid bestreken.
En hij dorst niet meer buitenkomen.
LXXVIII.
Omtrent tien uur des voormiddags werden Soetkin en Uilenspiegel in
de folterkamer gebracht.
Daar waren de baljuw, de griffier en de schepenen, de beul van Brugge,
zijn knecht en een chirurgijn-baardemaker.
De baljuw vroeg aan Soetkin of zij niets achterhield dat den keizer
toekwam. Zij antwoordde dat zij, mits zij niets bezat, niets kon
achterhouden.
--En gij? vroeg hij aan Uilenspiegel.
--Voor zeven maanden, antwoordde hij, erfden wij zevenhonderd
karolussen; eenigen daarvan zijn verteerd. En ik weet niet waar de
andere zijn, maar ik denk dat de reiziger, die tot onzen rampspoed
ten onzent verbleef, die heeft medegenomen, want nooit heb ik thuis
karolussen gezien.
De baljuw vroeg toen nog eens of beiden in hun gezegde bleven
volherden.
Zij antwoordden, dat zij geenerlei goed achterhielden dat den keizer
toekwam.
Ernstig doch vol medelijden, sprak de baljuw:
Mits de lasten tegen u beiden zwaar zijn, zult gij, zoo gij geen
bekentenis doet, de pijnbank moeten verduren.
--Spaar de weduw, sprak Uilenspiegel. De vischverkooper heeft alles
gekocht wat er was.
--Arme jongen, sprak Soetkin, de mannen kunnen geen smerten als de
vrouwen verdragen.
Als zij zag dat Uilenspiegel om harentwille wit als een doode was,
zeide zij nog:
--Ik haat en 'k ben sterk.
--Spaar de weduw, sprak Uilenspiegel.
--Neem mij in zijne plaats, zei Soetkin.
De baljuw vroeg aan den beul of alles gereed was om de waarheid
te ontrukken.
De beul antwoordde:
Alles is gereed.
De rechters, na beraadslaagd te hebben, besloten dat men moest beginnen
met de vrouw, om 't stuk te doen bekennen.
--Want, sprak een der schepenen, geen zoon is zoo wreedaardig dat hij
zijne moeder kan zien lijden, zonder te bekennen om heur te verlossen.
De baljuw sprak tot den scherprechter:
--Zet de vrouw op den stoel en doe de stokskens aan heure handen
en voeten.
De beul gehoorzaamde.
--Ho! doet dat niet, mijne heeren, riep Uilenspiegel. Bindt mij vast
in heure plaats, breekt mijne vingeren en teenen, maar spaart heur!
--De vischverkooper! riep Soetkin. Ik haat en 'k ben sterk.
Uilenspiegel werd nog bleeker, beefde en zweeg.
De stokskens, die van palmhout waren, werden tusschen de vingeren
gestoken. Door middel van koordjes waren zij tot een zoo vernuftigen
toestel gemaakt, dat de beul naar den wil van den rechter, al
de vingeren kon pletteren, of den lijder maar een geringe pijn
veroorzaken.
Hij stak de stokskens tusschen de vingeren en teenen van Soetkin.
--Trek aan, zei de baljuw.
De hangman deed het wreedelijk.
Toen sprak de baljuw tot Soetkin:
--Zeg mij waar de karolussen liggen.
--Ik weet het niet, antwoordde zij zuchtend.
--Nijp harder, sprak hij.
Uilenspiegel wilde zijne armen losrukken, die op zijnen rug waren
gebonden, om Soetkin te hulpe te komen.
--Doet niet prangen, heeren rechters, het zijn teere en broze
vrouwenvingeren. Een vogeltje zou ze aan stukken pikken. Prangt niet;
heer scherprechter, ik spreek geenszins tot u, want gij moet doen
wat die heeren u heeten. Spant niet, hebt medelijden.
--De vischverkooper! riep Soetkin.
En Uilenspiegel zweeg.
Doch, als hij zag dat de beul de stokskens harder deed spannen,
riep hij opnieuw:
--Erbarming, heeren! Daar breekt gij heure vingeren die zij noodig
heeft om te werken. Laas! heure voeten, nu zal zij niet meer kunnen
gaan! Erbarming, heeren!
--Vischverkooper, gij zult een bangen dood sterven! riep Soetkin.
En heure beenderen kraakten en 't bloed van heure voeten gutste
ten gronde.
Uilenspiegel zag het en sprak, bevend van smert en van gramschap:
--Vrouwenbeenderen, breekt ze toch niet, heeren rechters.
--De vischverkooper! zuchtte Soetkin.
En heure stem was zacht als de stem van eene schim.
--Heeren rechters, de handen en voeten zijn rood van 't bloed. Men
heeft heure beenderen gekraakt.
De chirurgijn-baardemaker raakte ze aan, en Soetkin stiet een kreet
van smerte.
--Beken in heure plaats, zei de baljuw tot Uilenspiegel.
Maar Soetkin bezag hem met opengesperde oogen, als die van een
doode. En hij begreep dat hij niet spreken mocht, en weende zonder
een woord te uiten.
--Daar die vrouwe de kloekmoedigheid des mans heeft, sprak toen de
baljuw, moet men ze beproeven door heuren zoon onder heure oogen uit
te rekken.
Soetkin hoorde niet, want zij lag in bezwijming, door de pijnen die
zij uitstond.
Men deed ze met azijn tot heur zelve komen.
Vervolgens werd Uilenspiegel ontkleed en bloot voor de oogen zijner
moeder gesteld. De beul scheerde hem zijn haar af, om te zien of
hij geenerlei tooverteeken verbolgen hield. Toen zag hij op zijn
rug een zwarte geboortevlek. Verscheidene reizen stak hij er in met
een lange naalde; er kwam bloed uit, en hij was van oordeel dat het
litteeken geen tooverije verborg. Op 't bevel van den baljuw, werden
Uilenspiegel's handen gebonden met twee koorden, die rond een wielken
aan een zolderbalk hingen, zoodat de beul, op bevel van de rechters,
hem met geweldige schokken kon optrekken en weer laten vallen; dit
deed hij wel negen reizen, na vooraf aan elk been een gewicht van
vijf en twintig pond te hebben gebonden.
Bij den negenden schok, scheurde de huid en werden polsen en enkels
ontwricht.
--Belijd, sprak de baljuw.
--Neen, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
Soetkin bezag heuren zoon, doch zij had de kracht niet om te roepen
of te spreken; zij stak alleenlijk heure bloedige handen uit, ten
teeken dat men die folteringen zou staken.
Maar de beul trok Uilenspiegel nogmaals op, om hem te laten vallen. En
het vel der polsen en enkels scheurde erger en zijn voeten werden
nog erger ontwricht; doch hij schreeuwde niet.
Soetkin weende en zwaaide met heure bloedige handen.
--Belijd, sprak de baljuw, en gij krijgt vergiffenis.
--De vischverkooper heeft vergiffenis noodig, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Is 't om met de rechters te spotten? vroeg een der schepenen.
--Spotten? Laas, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, ik heb er geen lust toe,
ge moogt mij gelooven.
Soetkin zag toen den beul, op bevel van den baljuw, een fornuis
aanstoken, terwijl een beulsknecht twee keersen deed branden.
Zij wilde rechtstaan op heure vermorzelde voeten, doch zij viel terug,
uitroepende:
--Weg met dat vuur! Ach! heeren rechters, spaart zijne jeugd. Weg
met dat vuur!
--De vischverkooper! riep Uilenspiegel, heur ziende wankelen.
--Trek Uilenspiegel een voet boven den grond, sprak de baljuw; stel
het fornuis onder zijne voeten en eene keers onder elken oksel.
De beul gehoorzaamde. Het haar onder de okselen knetterde en schroeide
onder de vlamme.
Uilenspiegel schreeuwde, en Soetkin sprak weenend:
--Doe dat vuur weg.
--Belijd, sprak de baljuw, en gij zult verlost zijn. Belijd voor
hem, vrouwe.
En Uilenspiegel sprak:
--De vischverkooper verdient het eeuwige vuur!
Soetkin schudde het hoofd tot teeken dat zij niets te zeggen
had. Uilenspiegel knarste op zijne tanden, en weenend keek Soetkin
met verwilderde oogen naar heuren zoon.
Nochtans toen de beul de keersen uitgeblazen had en het gloeiend
fornuis onder Uilenspiegels voeten plaatste riep zij uit:
--Heeren rechters, hebt medelijden met hem, hij weet niet wat hij zegt.
--En waarom niet? vroeg de baljuw listiglijk.
--Ondervraagt heur niet, heeren rechters, sprak Uilenspiegel, gij
ziet wel dat de smert heur waanzinnig maakt. De vischverkooper heeft
gelogen.
--Spreekt gij als hij, vrouw? vroeg de baljuw.
Soetkin knikte van ja.
--Verbrandt den vischverkooper! riep Uilenspiegel.
Soetkin zweeg, hief den arm tot vermaledijding omhoog.
Doch als zij het fornuis zag gloeien onder de voeten haars zoons,
riep zij uit:
--Heere God! Heilige Maria, die in de hemelen zijt, stelt toch een
einde aan die marteling! Ontferming! Doe het vuur weg!
--De vischverkooper! zuchtte Uilenspiegel nog.
Hij spuwde bloed door den mond en de neusgaten, en hij bleef met
gebogen hoofde, boven de gloeiende kolen hangen.
Toen riep Soetkin:
--Hij is dood! Zij hebben hem vermoord! Ha! hem ook! Rechters, doet
het vuur weg! Laat mij hem in mijne armen nemen, om getweeën te
sterven. Gij weet dat ik niet kan wegloopen, met mijn gebroken voeten.
--Geef de weduw haren zoon, sprak de baljuw.
Vervolgens gingen de rechters tot beraadslaging over.
De hangman maakte Uilenspiegel los en legde hem naakt en met bloed
overdekt op den schoot zijner moeder, terwijl de chirurgijn-baardemaker
de beenderen weer in de gewrichten bracht.
En Soetkin kuste Uilenspiegel, en weende en sprak:
Mijn zoon, arme martelaar! Ik zal u genezen, zoo de heeren rechters het
gedoogen; maar wordt toch wakker, Thijl, mijn zoon! Heeren rechters,
als gij hem gedood hebt, zal ik tot Zijne Majesteit gaan; want gij
hebt gehandeld tegen wet en recht, en gij zult zien wat een arme
vrouwe tegen de boozen vermag. Maar, heeren rechters, laat ons in
vrijheid. De hand Gods valt zwaar op ons neder, en wij zijn slechts
getweeën op de wereld.
Na beraadslaging, brachten de rechters de volgende sententie uit:
"Omme dieswille dat gij, Soetkin, weduwvrouwe van Klaas, en gij, Thijl,
zoon van Klaas, in de wandelinge Uilenspiegel, beschuldigd het goed
geroofd te hebben dat door verbeurdverklaring, niettegenstaande alle
privileges, aan Zijne Koninklijke Majesteit toebehoorde, in weerwil
van de pijnbank en voldoende beproevingen, niets beleden hebt;
"Overwegende het gebrek aan bewijzen, en gezien den erbarmlijken
staat uwer ledematen, vrouwe, en de tortuur die gij onderstaan
hebt, man, verklaart de vierschaar u beiden vrij en staat u toe,
niettegenstaande uwe armoede, te wonen bij hem of heur van de stede,
waar het u believen zal.
"Aldus gewijsd ende geprononcieerd te Damme, den drij en twintigsten
van Wijnmaand van 't jaar onzes Heeren 1558."
--Weest gezegend, heeren rechters, sprak Soetkin.
--De vischverkooper! zuchtte Uilenspiegel.
En moeder en zoon werden op eene kar naar 't huis van Katelijne
gevoerd.
LXXIX.
In dat jaar, het acht en vijftigste der eeuw, kwam Katelijne bij
Soetkin binnen en sprak:
"Dezen nacht heb ik mij laten vervoeren, door middel van eenen stok
met zalve bestreken, naar den Onze-Lieve-Vrouwetoren. Daar zag ik de
sylphen de gebeden der menschen overgeven aan de engelen, dewelke naar
het hoogste der hemelen vlogen om ze naar den troon Gods te dragen. En
heel het hemelrijk was met fonkelende sterren bezaaid. Eensklaps
verhief zich van op een brandstapel een zwarte gedaante, die omtrent
mij op den toren kwam zitten. Ik herkende Klaas gelijk hij was in
zijn leven, met zijne kooldragerskleeren.--Wat doet gij hier op
Onze-Lieve-Vrouwetoren? vroeg hij mij,--Maar gij zelf, antwoordde
ik, waar gaat gij henen, vliegend door de lucht als eene zwaluw?--Ik
ga, sprak hij, naar het oordeel; hoort gij de trompet van den engel
niet? Ik stond dicht tegen hem, en voelde dat zijn lichaam niet vast
was gelijk dat der levenden, maar zoo licht dat ik er doorging als
door een warmen damp. Aan mijne voeten, heel Vlaanderenland door,
flikkerden eenige lichtjes, en ik sprak in mij zelve: Zij die vroeg
opstaan en spade werken, zijn gezegend door God.
En heel den nacht hoorde ik de trompet van den engel schallen. En ik
zag een andere gedaante omhoog stijgen; ze kwam uit Spanje; deze was
oud en afgeleefd; siroop van kweeperen hing nog aan hare lippen. Om de
schouders droeg zij een karmozijnpannen mantel, gevoerd met hermelijn,
op het hoofd eene keizerskroon, in de eene hand eene ansjovis, in de
andere een beker bier.
Zij kwam, zeker uit vermoeienis, op Onze-Lieve-Vrouwetoren
zitten. Nederknielend vroeg ik haar: Gekroonde Majesteit, vol eerbied
lig ik voor U neder, doch ik ken U niet. Van waar komt gij, wat doet
gij op de wereld?--Ik kom, sprak zij, van Sint-Just in Estramadura,
en was keizer Karel de vijfde.--Maar, vroeg ik, waar vaart gij henen,
in dien kouden nacht, door dien hemel vol hagelwolken?--Ik ga, was
het antwoord, naar het oordeel.
Als de keizer zijne ansjovis wilde eten en zijn bier wilde drinken,
schalde de trompet van den engel. En de keizer verhief zich in de
lucht, grommend omdat hij niet voorteten kon. Ik volgde Zijne Heilige
Majesteit. Hij vloog door het luchtruim, hijgend van vermoeienis,
blazend van aamborstigheid, en soms brakend, want hij was van overdaad
gestorven. Wij klommen hooger en hooger, gelijk de pijlen uit eenen
boog van kornoelje-hout. De sterren vlogen ons voorbij en lieten
vurige strepen na. De trompet des engels weerschalde, met een machtig,
klaterend geweld. Bij elk geschal dat door de ruimte klonk, sloeg
de lucht uiteen, alsof een orkaan had geblazen. En aldus werd de weg
gebaand. Duizend uren hoog en nog meer, zagen we Christus, in al zijn
heerlijkheid op een sterrentroon gezeten. Aan zijne rechterzijde, zat
de engel die de daden der menschen opteekent in een bronzen boek, en
aan zijne linkerzijde, Maria, zijne moeder, die de zondaren voorsprak.
Klaas en keizer Karel knielden neder voor den troon.
De engel sloeg den keizer de krone van 't hoofd:--Christus alleen is
keizer, sprak hij.
Zijne Heilige Majesteit scheen verstoord, doch nederig vroeg hij:
Zou ik dit ansjovisje en dit bier niet mogen behouden, want 'k heb
honger van die lange luchtvaart?--Gelijk heel uw leven, antwoordde
de engel; nu, eet en drink maar.
Als hij gedaan had, vroeg Christus:
--Komt gij met zuivere ziele naar 't oordeel?
--Ik hoop het, zoete heer Jezus, want ik heb gebiecht, antwoordde
keizer Karel.
--En gij, Klaas? vroeg Christus; gij beeft niet lijk die keizer.
--Heer Jezus, antwoordde Klaas, geenerlei ziele is teenemaal zuiver,
doch ik heb geen angst voor U, die het opperste goed en de opperste
rechtveerdigheid zijt; maar ik vrees voor mijne zonden, die groot in
getal waren.
--Spreek, aardworm, sprak de engel tot den keizer.
--Heer, antwoordde Karel met verlegene stem, gezalfd door de hand uwer
priesteren, werd ik koning van Castilië, keizer van Duitschland en
Roomsch koning gewijd. Steeds nam ik de instandhouding van de macht,
die van U komt, ter herte, en ik ging de ketterije te keer te vuur
en te zweerd, met put en galg.
--Leugenaar, sprak de engel, gij wilt ons bedriegen. In Duitschland
duldet gij de ketteren, want gij vreesdet hen, maar gij deedt ze
onthalzen, branden, hangen en levend begraven in de Nederlanden,
dáár waar gij vreesdet niet genoeg te erven van die noeste bijen, zoo
rijk aan honig. Honderd duizend menschen werden ter dood gebracht,
niet omdat gij Christus, mijnen Heere, bemindet, maar omdat gij
een dwingeland, een landverwoester waart, die niemand bemindet, dan
zichzelven, en daarna het vleesch, de visch, het bier en den wijn,
want gij waart gulzig als een hond en dronkt als eene spons.
--En gij, Klaas, spreek, zegde Christus.
Doch de engel stond recht en sprak:
--Deze heeft niets te zeggen. Hij was goedhertig, neerstig, gelijk
heel het Vlaamsche volk, dat geerne werkt en geerne lacht, dat den
eed gestand bleef, denwelken het aan zijne vorsten gezworen had, in
den waan dat zijne vorsten ook den hunne zouden houden. Hij had geld,
hij werd in beschuldiging gesteld, en omdat hij een ketter gehuisd had,
werd hij levend verbrand.
Maria sprak toen:--Arme martelaar! doch in het hemelrijk zijn frissche
bronnen, fonteinen die melk en wijn spuiten; kom mee, kooldrager,
ik zal u leiden.
Nogmaals schalde de trompet van den engel en, van uit het diepste des
afgronds, zag ik een schoonen, naakten man verrijzen, met een ijzeren
krone op 't hoofd. En op den band van de krone stond geschreven:
Droef tot op den dag der gerechtigheid.
Hij naderde den troon en zeide tot Christus:
--Ik ben uw slaaf tot dat ik uw meester worde.
--Satan, sprak Maria, eens komt een dag waarop er geen meesters noch
slaven meer zijn, waarop Christus dewelke liefde is, en Satan, die
de hoogmoed is, beteekenen zullen: Macht en kennis.
--Vrouwe, gij zijt goed en schoon, zegde Satan.
En naar den keizer wijzend, vroeg hij aan Christus:
--Wat moet ik hiermee doen?
Christus antwoordde:
--Dien gekroonden worm zult gij brengen in eene zaal, waar al de
foltertuigen verzameld zijn, die onder zijne regeering gebruikt
werden. Telkens dat een arme onschuldige de pijne des waters
verduren zal, die de menschen opzwelt lijk blazen; of de pijne der
keersen, die hunne voetzolen en okselen verbranden; of de pijne
der radbraking, die de ledematen plettert; of de pijne der olie;
telkens dat een vrije ziel op den brandstapel den laatsten snik
zal geven, moet hij op zijne beurt dien dood, die smerten verduren,
opdat hij leere hoeveel kwaad een onrechtveerdig man doen kan, die
over millioenen gebiedt; hij verga in de gevangenissen, hij sterve
op de brandstapels, zuchte in ballingschap, ver van het Vaderland;
hij worde geschavotteerd, ontpoorterd, gegeeseld, gebrandmerkt; hij
weze rijk, opdat de bedezetters hem alles ontnemen; de afgunstige
klage hem aan en de verbeurdverklaring brenge hem ten onder. Gij zult
van hem maken een ezel, opdat hij zachtzinnig, mishandeld en slecht
gevoed weze; een arme, opdat hij bedele en beleedigingen erlange; een
arbeider, opdat hij zich afbeule en niet genoegzaam te eten krijge;
vervolgens, als hij als mensch naar ziel en lichaam alles geleden
heeft, maakt gij van hem een hond, opdat hij braaf weze en slagen
krijge; een slaaf, omdat hij aan den meestbiedende verkocht worde;
een soldenier, opdat hij vechte voor anderen en zich late dooden
zonder te weten waarom. En als hij na afloop van driehonderd jaar
aldus alle smerten, alle ellenden geproefd heeft, zult gij er een
vrijen man van maken. Is hij in dien staat goed, gelijk Klaas was,
geef dan in een lachend, lommerig oord, onder een schoonen boom, de
eeuwige ruste aan zijn gebeente, en zijne vrienden zullen aan zijn
graf komen weenen en bloemen strooien ter zijner gedachtenis.
--Genade, mijn zoon, zeide Maria, hij wist niet wat hij deed, want
macht doet het herte versteenen.
--Geene genade, sprak Christus.
--Ach, zeide Zijne Majesteit, had ik slechts een glas wijn van
Andalusië.
--Kom, sprak Satan, 't is uit met wijn, met gebraad en gevogelte.
En naar het diepste der helle bracht hij de ziele van den armen keizer,
die nog van zijn stukje ansjovis at.
Uit medelijden liet Satan hem begaan. Dan zag ik die Heilige Maagd,
die Klaas naar het hoogste des hemelrijks leidde, daar waar de sterren
met trossen aan 't gewelf hangen. En daar waschten de engelen hem,
tot dat hij schoon en jong was. En zij gaven hem rijstpap met zilveren
lepels. En de hemel sloot zich."
--Hij is in den hemel, sprak de weduwe.
--De assche klopt op mijn hert, zei Uilenspiegel.
LXXX.
Gedurende de volgende drie en twintig dagen, werd Katelijne bleek en
mager, en dorde zij, alsof zij verteerd werd door een inwendig vuur.
Zij riep niet meer: Het vuur! Maakt open! mijn ziel wil er uit! doch
in vervoering sprak zij gedurig tot Nele: Bruid ben ik; bruid moet
gij wezen. Schoon is hij; lang haar; vurige liefde; koude knieën en
koude armen!
En Soetkin bezag haar treuriglijk, en dacht dat het een nieuwe uiting
van waanzin was.
Heure rede vervolgend, sprak Katelijne:
--Driemaal drie is negen, een heilig getal. Hij alleen die 's nachts
fonkelende oogen als katoogen heeft, ziet de geheimenis.
Toen Soetkin heur op een avond zoo bezig hoorde, schudde zij
vertwijfeld het hoofd. Doch Katelijne sprak:
--Vier en drie, ongeluk onder Saturnus; onder Venus, een
bruiloftgetal. Koude armen! Koude knieën! Een herte van vuur!
Soetkin antwoordde:
--Gij moogt van die leelijke heidensche afgoden niet spreken.
Katelijne hoorde dit; zij sloeg een kruis en sprak:
--Gezegend zij de grijze ruiter. Nele moet een man hebben, een schoonen
man met een zweerd, een zwarten man met blinkend gelaat.
--Ja, sprak Uilenspiegel, eene mannenstoverij, voor dewelke ik met
mijn mes de saus zal maken.
Nele bezag teederlijk heuren vriend, want zij was gelukkig omdat hij
jaloersch was.
--Ik wil dien niet, sprak zij.
Katelijne antwoordde:
--Wanneer komt hij, die in 't grijs gekleed, en altijd anders geleersd
en gespoord is?
Soetkin sprak:
--Bidt God voor de uitzinnige.
--Uilenspiegel, zei Katelijne, haal ons twee stoopen dobbele kuite,
terwijl ik de heetekoeken bak.
Soetkin vroeg waarom zij den Zaterdag vierde, naar de wijs van
de Joden.
Katelijne antwoordde:
--Omdat het deeg gerezen is.
Uilenspiegel stond met den grooten kroes van Engelsch tin in de hand,
waarin juist twee stoopen gingen.
--Moeder, vroeg hij, wat moet ik doen?
--Ga, sprak Katelijne.
Daar zij geene meesteresse in huis was, wilde Soetkin niet
tegenspreken. Zij zegde tot Uilenspiegel:--Ga, mijn zoon.
Uilenspiegel liep naar den Staak en kwam terug met twee stoopen
dobbele kuite.
Weldra verspreidde de geur der heetekoeken zich in de keuken, en
allen hadden honger, tot zelfs Soetkin.
Uilenspiegel liet het zich goed smaken. Katelijne had hem een grooten
beker gegeven, zeggende dat, aangezien hij de eenige man, hoofd van
het huis, was, hij meer moest drinken dan de anderen en vervolgens
moest zingen.
En zij lachte heimelijk, maar Uilenspiegel dronk, doch zong niet. Nele
weende als zij Soetkin bleek en gansch ineengevallen zag zitten;
alleen Katelijne was vroolijk.
Na het avondmaal gingen Soetkin en Uilenspiegel naar boven op den
zolder slapen; Katelijne en Nele bleven in de keuken, alwaar heure
bedden nu stonden.
Rond twee uren des morgens als Uilenspiegel, door het zware bier,
al lang sliep, lag Soetkin gelijk alle nachten wakker, Maria biddende
dat zij heur slaap zou zenden, doch Maria aanhoorde heur niet.
Eensklaps hoorde zij den schreeuw van een nachtuil en, uit de keuken,
antwoordde een dergelijke kreet; vervolgens, in de verte, in den
kouter, weerklonken andere kreten en altijd scheen het heur dat men
die in de keuken beantwoordde.
Denkend dat het nachtvogelen waren, sloeg zij er niet verder
acht op. Zij hoorde peerdengehennik en hoevengetrappel op den
steenweg. Zij opende het venster en zag inderdaad twee gezadelde
peerden, die stampend het gras van den berm schoren. Toen hoorde zij
een schreeuwende vrouwenstem, een dreigende mannenstem, herhaalde
slagen, nieuwe kreten, eene deur met gedruis toeslaan en angstige
stappen de trap opklimmen.
Uilenspiegel snorkte en hoorde er niets van; de deur van den
zolder vloog open en, schier naakt, sprong Nele hijgend en snikkend
binnen. En in haast schoof zij eene tafel, stoelen, een oud komfoor en
al het huisraad dat zij vinden kon, tegen de deur. De laatste sterren
verbleekten aan het uitspansel; de hanen kraaiden; zij kondigden den
dageraad aan.
Op het gerucht dat Nele maakte, keerde Uilenspiegel zich om in zijn
bed, zonder wakker te worden.
Nele viel om Soetkin's hals en sprak:--Soetkin, ik ben bang, steek
eene keers aan.
Soetkin deed het en Nele zuchtte voortdurend.
Als de keers aangestoken was, bezag Soetkin het meisje, en ze zag dat
heur hemd op den schouder gescheurd was. Op heur voorhoofd, heure
kaken, in heuren hals zag zij bloedende schrammen, gelijk krabben
van nagels.
--Nele, vroeg Soetkin heur kussend, van waar komen die, schrammen?
Steeds bevend en zuchtend, sprak het meisje:
--Doe ons niet verbranden, Soetkin.
Doch Uilenspiegel werd wakker en wreef zich de oogen, verblind als hij
was door de klaarte der keers. Soetkin vroeg:--Wie is beneden? Nele
antwoordde:--Zwijg, 't is de man dien Katelijne mij geven wil.
Soetkin en Nele hoorden Katelijne plotseling schreeuwen, en heure
beenen knikten van schrik.--Hij slaat heur om mij, sprak Nele.
--Wie is er in huis? riep Uilenspiegel, uit zijn bed
springend. Vervolgens liep hij door de kamer tot dat hij een zwaar
stookijzer gevonden had, dat in eenen hoek lag.
--Niemand, sprak Nele, ga niet beneden, Uilenspiegel!
Maar hij luisterde niet, liep naar de deur, trok stoelen, tafels en
komfoor uit den weg. Katelijne schreeuwde nog altijd beneden. Nele
en Soetkin hielden Uilenspiegel vast, om zijn lijf, bij zijne beenen,
en spraken:--Ga niet beneden, Uilenspiegel, 't zijn duivelen.
--Ja, sprak hij, duivelsche man van Nele, ik breng u het stookijzer
tot gade. Een huwelijk van ijzer en vleesch. Laat mij, beneden!
Doch zij lieten hem niet los, want zij waren sterk, en klampten zich
vast aan de leun van de trap. Maar zij vermochten niet hem te houden,
en, naar beneden vliegend als een lawine, stormde hij de keuken
binnen. Daar zag hij Katelijne bleek en ontdaan, en hoorde haar
zeggen:--Hansken, waarom verlaat gij mij? 't Is mijne schuld niet;
Nele is stout.
Zonder te luisteren, opende Uilenspiegel de deur van het
stalleken. Hij vond er niemand; hij liep naar den kouter en van
daar op den steenweg: van verre zag hij twee dravende peerden in
den morgennevel verdwijnen. Hij wilde ze achterhalen, maar ze renden
gelijk de stormwind, die de droge bladeren opjaagt.
Vol gramschap en vertwijfeling kwam hij binnen, fluisterend:--Zij
hebben heur gehoond! En met een onheilspellend vuur in de oogen, bezag
hij Nele; deze, die huiverend voor Soetkin en Katelijne stond, sprak:
--Neen, Thijl, mijn geliefde, neen.
Dit zeggende, keek zij hem zoo droef en oprecht in de oogen, dat
Uilenspiegel zag dat zij de waarheid sprak. Toen ondervroeg hij heur:
--Van waar kwamen die kreten? Waar gingen die mannen? Waarom is
uw hemde gescheurd? Van waar komen die krabben op uwe kaken en uw
voorhoofd?
--Luister, Uilenspiegel, doe ons niet verbranden. Katelijne--God
beware heur voor de helle--heeft sedert drie-en-twintig dagen een in
't zwart gekleeden, geleersden en gespoorden duivel tot vriend. Zijn
gelaat blinkt lijk het vuur dat 's zomers, als 't warm is, schittert
op de baren der zee.
--Waarom zijt gij vertrokken, Hansken, mijn lieveling? sprak Katelijne,
Nele is stout.
Maar Nele, vervolgende, sprak:--Hij schreeuwt als een nachtuil om zijne
komst te melden. Moeder ziet hem alle Zaterdagen in de keuken. Zij
zegt, dat zijne kussen als ijs zijn en zijn lichaam als sneeuw. Hij
slaat heur als zij niet doet wat hij heet. Eens bracht hij heur enkele
guldens mee, doch hij nam heur al de andere af.
Bij dit verhaal vouwde Soetkin de handen, om voor Katelijne te
bidden. Katelijne sprak blijde:
--Mijn lijf en mijn geest, alles zij hem. Hansken, mijn liefste,
leid mij nog naar den Sabbat. 't Is Nele, die nooit komen wil! Nele
is stout.
--Bij de ochtendschemering toog hij henen, vervolgde het meisje,
's anderen daags vertelde moeder mij dan allerhande zonderlinge
dingen.... Maar bezie mij toch zoo kwaad niet, Uilenspiegel. Gisteren
zeide zij mij dat een schoon heer, in 't grijs gekleed en Hilbert
genaamd, mij ten huwelijk wilde en thuis zou komen, om zich te
toonen. Ik antwoordde dat ik geen man wilde, hij mocht schoon zijn of
leelijk. Zij deed mij opblijven om hen te verbeiden; want zij is dan
geenszins van heure zinnen, als 't minnarijen geldt. Wij waren half
ontkleed, gereed om te gaan slapen; ik sliep op genen stoel. Toen
zij binnenkwamen, werd ik niet wakker. Plotseling voelde ik iemand
die mij omhelsde, mij in mijnen hals kuste. En in den maneschijn zag
ik een helder gezicht, gelijk het schuim der branding in Hooimaand,
bij broeiend weer, en hoorde ik stille fluisteren:--Ik ben Hilbert,
uw verloofde; wees aan mij; 'k zal u rijk maken. Zijn gezicht stonk
naar visch. Ik stiet hem weg; hij wilde mij nemen met geweld, maar
'k was sterker dan tien mannen als hij. Doch hij scheurde mijn hemde,
kwetste mij aan mijn aangezicht en herhaalde: Wees aan mij, 'k zal
u rijk maken.--Ja, zei ik, lijk mijne moeder, wier laatsten duit gij
nemen zult.--Toen verdubbelde hij zijne pogingen, maar hij vermocht
niets tegen mij. Hij was nog leelijker dan een doode, en ik krabde
hem zoo geweldig met mijne nagelen in zijne oogen, dat hij kermde. Zoo
geraakte ik los, en kwam ik bij Soetkin vluchten.
Katelijne herhaalde gedurig:
--Nele is stout. Waarom zijt gij zoo gauw vertrokken, Hansken,
mijn liefste?
--Waar waart gij, slechte moeder, sprak Soetkin, terwijl men de eer
van uw kind wilde rooven?
--Nele is stout, zegde Katelijne. Ik zat bij mijn zwarten heer,
toen de grijze duivel met bloedend gelaat bij ons kwam en sprak: Kom
mede, kameraad, het deugt hier niet; de mannen willen ons doodslaan
en de vrouwen hebben messen aan heure vingeren. Daarop sprongen zij
te peerd en verdwenen zij in den nevel. Nele is stout!
LXXXI.
's Anderen daags, onder 't ontbijt, sprak Soetkin tot Katelijne:
--Gij ziet dat wee en smerte mij overal volgen, wilt gij mij uw huis
doen ontvluchten, met uwe verdoemde hekserijen?
Maar Katelijne sprak:
Nele is stout. Kom weder, mijn Hansken.
Den volgenden Woensdag kwamen de beide duivelen terug. Sedert den
Zaterdag sliep Nele bij de weduwe Vanden Houte, zeggende dat zij
niet langer bij Katelijne mocht vernachten, om Uilenspiegel, mits
dit opspraak zou verwekken.
Katelijne ontving heuren zwarten heer en zijnen vriend in de keete,
die tot waschhuis diende en waar de broodoven stond. En zij onthaalde
ze op ouden wijn en gerookte ossetong. De zwarte sprak tot Katelijne:
--Om een groot werk te verrichten, hebben wij veel geld van noode;
geef ons wat gij kunt.
Toen Katelijne hun maar één gulden geven wilde, dreigden ze heur met
den dood. Maar zij lieten heur los voor twee gouden karolussen en
zeven deniers.
--Komt 's Zaterdags niet meer, zeide zei. Uilenspiegel kent dien dag
en gewapend zal hij u wachten om u beiden te dooden, en na u zou ik
ook sterven.
--Wij zullen den naasten Dinsdag komen, zegden zij.
Dien dag sliepen Uilenspiegel en Soetkin zonder vreeze voor de
duivelen, want zij meenden dat ze 's Zaterdags kwamen.
Katelijne stond op en ging zien in de keete of heure vrienden daar
waren.
Zij was zeer ongeduldig, want sedert dat zij Hansken weergezien had,
was heure uitzinnigheid grootelijks verminderd, daar het minnegekheid
was, naar men zeide.
Als zij hen niet zag, was zij droef en troosteloos; maar in het veld,
uit de richting van Sluis, hoorde zij 't geschreeuw van den nachtuil
en zij ging er op af. En langs eenen dijk van rijshout en graszoden
stappend, hoorde zij aan den anderen kant van dien dijk de beide
duivelen samen in gesprek. De eene zei:
--Ik moet de helft hebben.
De andere antwoordde:
--Gij krijgt niets; wat Katelijne behoort, behoort mij.
Zij vloekten en twisten wie de have en de minne van Katelijne en Nele
al te gader hebben zou. Doch van schrik, bleef Katelijne roerloos
luisteren. Weldra hoorde zij ze vechten en een hunner zeggen: "Dat
ijzer is koud", dan een gereutel en den val van een zwaar lichaam.
Verschrikt, keerde zij naar heure woning terug. Rond twee uren van
den nacht hoorde zij opnieuw het gekras van den nachtuil, doch deze
reis was 't in hare lochting. Zij deed open en zag heuren vriend voor
de deur staan. Zij vroeg hem:
--Wat hebt gij met den andere gedaan?
--Hij zal niet meer komen.
Hij omhelsde en kuste haar. En zij vond hem nog kouder dan gewoonte. En
Katelijne was goed bij heur verstand. Toen hij heenging, eischte hij
twintig gulden, alles wat zij bezat: zij gaf er hem zeventien.
Door nieuwsgierigheid gedreven, keerde zij 's anderen daags terug
naar den dijk, maar zij vond niets dan op het gras eenen bloedplas zoo
groot als eene doodkist, 's Avonds wischte de regen de bloedvlek uit.
En den volgenden Woensdag hoorde zij opnieuw het gekras van den
nachtuil.
LXXXII.
Telkens dat Uilenspiegel geld noodig had om Katelijne 't
gemeenschappelijk verteer te betalen, ging hij 's nachts den steen
opheffen van het gat nabij den waterput, en nam hij eenen karolus.
Op een avond zaten de drie vrouwen te spinnen; Uilenspiegel maakte
eene doos, die de baljuw hem besteld had. Met veel vaardigheid sneed
hij er een schoone jachtpartij op, met eenen koppel Henegouwsche
honden, groote, bloeddorstige honden van Candia, Brabantsche honden
die getweeën loopen en ooreneters genoemd worden, verders allerhande
dikke en magere honden, alsmede mopsen en hazewinden.
Terwijl Katelijne daar was, vroeg Nele aan Soetkin of ze heuren
schat niet elders verbergen zou. De weduwe antwoordde argeloos,
dat hij niet beter kon zijn dan nevens den muur van den steenput.
Rond het midden van den Donderdagnacht, werd Soetkin gewekt door
Bibulus Snuffius, die zeer vinnig blafte, doch niet langdurig. Ze
dacht dat het niets was, en sliep weder in.
Toen Soetkin en Uilenspiegel Vrijdagsmorgens met den dageraad,
opstonden, zagen zij, dat Katelijne tegen heure gewoonte, in de keuken
niet was; en het vuur was niet aangestoken en de melk kookte niet. Zij
waren verwonderd en keken of ze bij toeval in de lochting niet was. In
weerwil van den motregen, zagen zij heur staan met loshangend haar,
in heur hemd, nat en bibberend, zonder te durven binnenkomen.
--Wat doet gij daar, schier naakt, in den regen?
--Ha! zegde ze, ja, ja, groot wonder!
En ze wees naar den hond die, verworgd, levenloos uitgestrekt lag.
Uilenspiegel dacht terstond aan den schat. Hij liep er henen. Het
hol was ledig en de aarde in 't ronde gestrooid.
Hij vloog naar Katelijne, en driftig heur slaande vroeg hij:
--Waar zijn de karolussen?
--Ja, ja, groot wonder! antwoordde Katelijne.
Nele, die toeliep, verdedigde heure moeder en smeekte:
--Sla niet, Uilenspiegel!
Hij hield op met slaan. Soetkin kwam toen bij en vroeg wat er scheelde.
Uilenspiegel wees naar den verworgden hond en het ledige gat.
Soetkin werd doodsbleek en sprak:
--Gij beproeft mij wel hard, heer God. Mijn arme voeten!
En zij zegde dat, om de smert die zij uitstond en om de pijniging
die zij nutteloos ondergaan had voor de gouden karolussen. Nele, als
ze Soetkin zoo verduldig zag, begon vertwijfeld te weenen. Katelijne
zwaaide met een stuk perkament en vervolgde:
--Ja, groot wonder is er geschied. Dezen nacht is hij gekomen, braaf
en schoon. Op zijn gelaat had hij dien witten schijn niet meer, die mij
steeds zoo verschrikte. Hij sprak mij liefdevol aan. Ik was verrukt en
mijn hert hoorde hem toe. Hij zegde mij: Nu ben ik rijk en weldra breng
ik duizend gouden florijnen.--Ja, zeide ik, dat doet mij meer genoegen
voor u dan voor mij, Hansken, mijn liefste.--Maar is hier niemand,
in huis, dien gij liefhebt en voor wien ik iets doen kan?--Neen,
antwoordde ik, zij die hier zijn, hebben niemand van noode.--Zijn
Soetkin en Uilenspiegel dan rijk? vroeg hij.--Zij leven zonder
iemands hulpe, antwoordde ik.--Niettegenstaande de verbeurte?--Daarop
antwoordde ik dat gij liever de pijnbank onderstaan hadt, dan uwe have
te laten ontnemen.--Dat wist ik, sprak hij. En stille en zachtjes
giegelend, begon hij te spotten met den baljuw en de schepenen,
omdat zij u geenerlei belijdenis konden ontrukken. En toen lachte ik
insgelijks. 't Ware ook dom geweest, sprak hij, van hunnen schat in
het huis te verbergen.... Ik lachte. "Of in den kelder?" Ik knikte
van neen. "Of in de lochting?" Ik antwoordde niet.--Ha! sprak hij,
dit ware zeer onvoorzichtig.--Integendeel, sprak ik, want water noch
muur zullen iets uitbrengen. En hij lachte voort.
--Dien nacht vertrok hij vroeger dan gewoonte, na mij een poeierken
gegeven te hebben met hetwelk ik, naar hij zeide, naar den schoonsten
sabbat zou gaan. Ik deed hem uitgeleide tot aan de deur van de
lochting, en ik was slaapdronken. Ik ging, zooals hij gezeid had,
naar den sabbat en kwam eerst met de ochtendschemering weder, hier
ter plaatse, waar ik den hond verworgd en het gat open vond. Dat is
een wreede slag voor mij, want ik beminde hem teederlijk en schonk
hem mijne ziel. Maar ik zal u alles geven wat ik bezit, en dag en
nacht werken om u te onderhouden.
--Ik ben als ijzer op het aambeeld; God en een dief treffen mij
tegelijk, zegde Soetkin.
--Zóó moogt gij niet spreken, antwoordde Katelijne; hij is geen dief,
maar een duivel. Ten blijke zal ik u het perkament toonen, dat hij
in de lochting achterliet. Daarop staat geschreven: "Vergeet nimmer
mij te dienen. Binnen driemaal twee weken en vijf dagen, krijgt gij
dobbel terug. Koester geen twijfel, of het kost u het leven."--En
hij zal woord houden.
--Arme zinnelooze! sprak Soetkin.
Het was heur laatste verwijt.
LXXXIII.
De twee weken waren driemaal voorbij en de vijf dagen insgelijks,
maar de duivel kwam niet terug. Doch Katelijne wanhoopte niet.
Soetkin werkte niet meer; zij stond gedurig bij het vuur, gebogen
en kuchende. Nele gaf heur de beste en geurigste kruiden; maar dat
alles kon niet baten. Uilenspiegel ging de hut niet meer buiten,
uit vreeze dat Soetkin onderwijl stierf.
Vervolgens kon zij niet meer eten of drinken zonder over te geven. De
chirurgijn-baardemaker kwam en deed heur eene lating; en toen was zij
zoo zwak, dat zij van heure bank niet meer kon opstaan. Eindelijk,
uitgeteerd van verdriet en van smert, sprak zij op een avond:
--Klaas, mijn man! Thijl, mijn zoon! Dank, de Heere neemt mij tot zich!
En zij blies den laatsten ademtocht uit.
Katelijne dorst bij heur niet waken, daarom deden Uilenspiegel en
Nele het getweeën, en heel den nacht baden zij voor de arme ziele.
Bij de ochtendschemering vloog een zwaluw het open venster binnen.
--De vogel der zielen, sprak Nele, dat is een goed teeken: Soetkin
is in den hemel.
De zwaluw vloog driemaal rond de kamer en verdween met een schellen
kreet.
Vervolgens kwam een andere zwaluw binnen, grooter en zwarter dan de
eerste. Zij vloog rondom Uilenspiegel en deze sprak:
--Vader en moeder, de assche klopt op mijne borst, ik zal doen wat
gij vraagt.
En de tweede zwaluw vloog kwetterend heen als de eerste. De oosterkim
verbleekte. Uilenspiegel zag duizenden zwaluwen rakelings over de
weide vliegen, en de zonne rees op.
En Soetkin werd op het armenveld begraven.
LXXXIV.
Sedert Soetkin's dood, liep Uilenspiegel droomend, treurig of
grammoedig de keuken op en neer; hij luisterde niet meer, at en dronk
wat men hem voorzette, zonder zelf iets te nemen. En dikwijls stond
hij 's nachts op.
Te vergeefs sprak de zoete stem van Nele hem moed in, te vergeefs zeide
Katelijne hem, dat zij wist dat Soetkin bij Klaas in den hemel was;
steeds antwoordde Uilenspiegel:
De assche klopt.
En hij geleek een waanzinnige en Nele weende als zij hem zoo
naargeestig zag.
En de vischverkooper bleef alleen in zijn huis als een vadermoorder,
en dorst slechts 's avonds buitenkomen; want de mannen en vrouwlieden
die hem zagen, jouwden hem uit en heetten hem moordenaar, en de
kleine kinderen vluchtten voor hem, daar men hun gezegd had, dat hij
de hangman was. En geschuwd door een iegelijk, dwaalde hij eenzaam in
't ronde, zonder eene taveerne te durven binnengaan; want men wees
er hem met den vinger, en, al bleef hij er slechts een korte wijl,
de andere klanten ledigden hun glas en gingen heen.
Daarom zagen de weerden hem noode komen, en zij sloten liever de deur
vóór zijn neus. Toen deed de vischverkooper hun nederig zijn beklag,
maar zij antwoordden hem, dat zij wel mochten tappen, maar dat zij
daartoe geenszins waren gedwongen.
Eindelijk ging de vischverkooper drinken in den Rooden Valk, eene
kleine herberg buiten de stad, aan de vaart naar Sluis. Daar wilde
men hem bedienen, want 't waren arme lieden, wien alle geldstukken
welkom waren. Maar de weerd of de weerdin uit den Rooden Valk spraken
nooit een woord tot hem. Daar waren twee kinderen en een hond: als
de vischverkooper de kleinen wilde streelen, liepen zij weg; en als
hij den hond riep, toonde deze brommend zijn tanden.
Op een avond stond Uilenspiegel aan de zulle; als Mathijssen, de
kuiper, hem zoo droomerig zag, zeide hij hem:
--Gij moet werken met uwe handen, om de smert te vergeten.
--De assche van Klaas klopt op mijne borst, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Ha! zei Mathijssen, de ellendige vischverkooper leidt een nog
treuriger leven dan gij. Niemand spreekt tot hem en elkeen schuwt hem,
zoodat hij genoodzaakt is bij de arme lieden uit den Rooden Valk te
gaan, om zijn kapperken bruinbier in eenzaamheid te drinken. 't Is
een groote straffe.
--De assche klopt! sprak nogmaals Uilenspiegel.
Dien zelfden avond, terwijl het negen uren sloeg op
Onze-Lieve-Vrouwetoren, ging Uilenspiegel naar den Rooden Valk en,
ziende dat de vischverkooper er niet was, ging hij traagzaam slenteren
onder de boomen langs de vaart. 't Was een heldere maneschijn.
Hij zag den moordenaar komen.
Juist als hij voorbij hem kwam, kon hij hem van dichtbij zien, en,
luide sprekend lijk de menschen die in alleenigheid leven, hooren
zeggen:--Waar mogen die karolussen steken?
--Waar de duivel ze gevonden heeft, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, en meteen
gaf hij hem een vuistslag in 't gezicht.
--Laas! sprak de vischverkooper, ik herken u, gij zijt de zoon, heb
medelijden, ik ben oud en krachteloos! Wat ik deed was geenszins uit
haat, maar om Zijne Majesteit te dienen. Schenk mij vergiffenis. Ik
zal u het huisraad afstaan dat ik gekocht heb, en gij moet er mij
geen oortje voor geven. Is 't niet genoeg? Ik kocht het voor zeven
gouden florijnen. Ik geef u alles en nog een halven gulden daarbij,
want ik ben niet rijk, dat moet gij niet denken.
En knielend vroeg hij vergiffenis.
Als Uilenspiegel hem zoo verachtelijk, zoo bang en zoo lafhertig zag,
smeet hij hem in de vaart.
En hij toog henen.
LXXXV.
De lichamen der slachtoffers walmden op de brandstapels. Aan Klaas
en Soetkin denkend, weende Uilenspiegel eenzaam in stilte.
Op een avond ging hij bij Katelijne, om heur hulp en raad te vragen.
Zij was alleen met Nele, die naaide bij het licht. Op 't gerucht
dat hij bij zijn binnenkomen maakte, hief Katelijne het hoofd op,
als iemand die uit een zwaren slaap schiet.
Hij sprak:
--De assche van Klaas klopt op mijne borst, ik wil Vlaanderenland
verlossen. Ik vroeg het aan den grooten God van hemel en aarde,
doch hij antwoordt mij niet.
Katelijne sprak:
--De groote God kon u niet hooren; gij moet eerst tot de sylphen
spreken, die tusschen hemel en aarde zweven en de klachten der menschen
ontvangen en overdragen aan de engelen, om ze naar den troon des
hemelrijks te brengen.
--Help mij daartoe, sprak hij, en 'k zal u met mijn bloed betalen,
als 't noodig is.
Katelijne sprak:
--Ik zal u helpen, zoo een meisje dat u bemint, u wil medenemen naar
den Sabbat der Lentegeesten, het Pascha van 't Levenssap.
--Ik zal hem meenemen, zegde Nele.
In een kristallen beker goot Katelijne een grijsachtig vocht, dat zij
streek aan hunne slapen, neusgaten, palmen der handen en polsen; zij
deed hun elk een snuifken witte poeier eten, en zei dat ze elkander
in de oogen moesten zien, opdat hunne zielen één zouden worden.
Uilenspiegel keek Nele aan, en de zoete oogen van 't meisje ontstaken
in hem een blakerend vuur; toen begon het vocht te werken en hij
voelde als duizenden spelden in zijn lijf steken.
Vervolgens ontkleedden zij zich, en zij waren schoon in hunne
schamelheid, verlicht door de lamp: hij in al zijn fiere kracht, zij
in heure liefelijke bevalligheid. Maar reeds half ingeslapen, zagen
zij elkander niet. Toen legde Katelijne het hoofd van het meisje in
Uilenspiegels arm en zijne hand op heur hert.
En zoo bleven zij naast malkander liggen.
Het scheen hun beiden, dat hunne elkander rakende lichamen de zachte
warmte hadden van de zonne, in de maand van de rozen.
Zij stonden op, gelijk zij later zeiden, klommen op de vensterbank,
vlogen van daar in de ruimte en voelden, dat de lucht hen droeg als
het water de schepen draagt.
Toen zagen zij niets meer, noch de aarde waar de arme menschenkinderen
sliepen, noch den hemel waarin zoo even de wolken voor hunne voeten
holden. En zij zetten den voet op Sirius, de koude sterre. Van daar
werden zij op de pool geworpen.
Daar zagen zij, niet zonder schrik, een naakten reus, den reus
Winter, met ruig haar, op schotsen, met den rug tegen eenen ijsmuur
gezeten. Een huilende troep ijsberen en zeehonden zwommen in de
plassen rond hem. Met heesche stemme riep hij op: hagel, sneeuw, koude
regenbuien, donderwolken, rosse, stinkende nevelen, dwarrelwinden en de
snerpende noordenwinden. En allen woedden te gelijk in dit akelig oord.
De reus lachte al dien rampspoed toe en vlijde zich neer op de bloemen
die zijne hand verwelkt, op de bladeren die zijn adem verdroogd
had. Dan zich vooroverbuigend en den grond met zijne nagelen krabbend,
er met de tanden in bijtend, groef hij een hol, ten einde het hert
der aarde te bereiken, om het te verslinden, en de lommerige bosschen
tot zwarte kolenbedden, de gouden korenaren tot verbrand stroo, de
vruchtbare landouwen tot dorre vlakten te verkeeren. Doch het herte
der aarde was van vuur, en hij dorst het niet naderen, maar trok zich,
bevreesd, terug.
Daar troonde hij als koning, en ledigde hij zijnen beker traan, te
midden van de beren en zeehonden en van de geraamten dergenen die hij
doodde op zee, op het land en in de hutten der armen. Blijde hoorde
hij de beren brommen, de zeehonden huilen, de beenderen kletteren van
de geraamten van menschen en beesten, onder de klauwen van gieren
en raven, die er een laatsten hap vleesch aan zochten, alsook het
gekrakkrak van de ijsschotsen, die in het doode water tegen elkander
stootten.
En de stem van den reus was gelijk het geloei van den orkaan, het
geschuifel van den storm en 't gehuil van den wind in de schoorsteenen.
--Ik heb koude en ben bang, zei Uilenspiegel.
--Hij vermag niets tegen de geesten, antwoordde Nele.
Plotseling ontstond een groote beweging onder de zeehonden, die ijlings
in 't water trokken, onder de ijsberen, die, met neerhangende ooren,
jammerlijk bromden en onder de raven, die, krassend van angst in de
wolken verdwenen.
En nu hoorden Nele en Uilenspiegel de doffe slagen van den stormram
tegen de muren van ijs, waarop de reus Winter gezeten was. En de muur
kloofde en waggelde op zijne grondvesten.
Doch de reus Winter hoorde niets, en hij huilde en tierde blijmoedig,
vulde en ledigde zijnen beker en zocht naar het hert van de aarde om
het te verstijven, maar hij dorst het niet aanraken.
De slagen weerklonken harder en harder, de muur spleet meer en meer,
en een regen van ijsscherven viel rondom hem.
En de beren gromden jammerlijk en de zeehonden huilden in de doode
wateren.
De muur stortte in, de zonne werd zichtbaar; een schoone, jonge man
met een gouden akst in de hand, daalde neder. Die man was Lucifer,
koning Lente.
Als de reus hem bemerkte, wierp hij zijn beker traan weg en smeekte
hem niet te dooden.
En bij den zoelen adem van koning Lente, verloor de reus Winter al
zijne kracht. Toen nam de koning een diamanten keten, en hij bond er
den reus mee vast aan de pool.
Dan riep hij, doch teeder en liefdevol. En uit den hemel daalde een
schoone, blonde vrouw. Zij zette zich nevens den koning en zeide
tot hem:
--Sterke man, gij zijt mijn overwinnaar.
Hij antwoordde:
--Hebt gij honger, eet; hebt gij dorst, drink; zijt gij bang, kom
bij mij: ik ben uw man.
--Ik heb honger en dorst alleen naar u, zegde zij.
De koning riep nog zeven reizen met verschrikkelijke stemme. En er was
een groot gedruisch van donders en bliksemen, en achter hen verrees een
gehemelte van zonnen en sterren. En beiden zetten zich op den troon.
Toen weerklonk een geroep des konings en der vrouwe; hun edel gelaat
verroerde niet, en hun gebaar was niet strijdig met hunne kracht
en waardigheid.
Op die kreten ontstond een golvende beweging in den grond, in den
harden steen, in de ijsschotsen. En Nele en Uilenspiegel hoorden een
gerucht lijk dat, welk reusachtige vogelen zouden maken, die de schaal
van ontzaglijke eieren wilden doorpikken.
En, in die rijzing en daling van den grond, gelijk de baren der zee,
waren vormen als van een ei.
Eensklaps rezen allerwegen boomen op, wier dorre takken zich
strengelden, wier stammen wankelden lijk dronken mannen. Dan scheidden
zij, een groote ruimte tusschen zich latend. Aardgeesten stegen uit den
geschokten grond; uit het diepst van het woud kwamen de boschgeesten,
uit de naburige zee de watergeesten.
Uilenspiegel en Nele zagen daar de ruige, gebochelde, grijnzende en
mismaakte dwergen, die de schatten bewaren; de vorsten der gesteenten;
de boschmannen, die leven als boomen en, in stee van mond en maag,
onderaan 't gezicht vezelige wortels dragen, om aldus hun voedsel uit
de aarde te zuigen; de bergvorsten, die niet kunnen spreken, hert noch
ingewand hebben, zich bewegen als ledepoppen in schittergewaad. Daar
waren dwergen van vleesch en beenderen, met hagedissteerten en
kikvorschkoppen, met eene lanteern op het hoofd, die 's nachts op
de schouders van de dronken voetgangers of vreesachtige reizigers
springen, en, hunne lanteern zwierend, hen leiden en brengen naar
sompen of spelonken, terwijl de arme verdwaalden meenen dat die
lanteern de keerse is, die flikkert in hunne woning.
Daar waren ook de bloemenmaagden, dochteren vol vrouwelijke kracht
en gezondheid, fier over heure schoonheid, en die heur krachtig haar
als een zijden mantel openspreidden.
Hare vochtige oogen schitterden als perelmoer in het water, het vleesch
van heur lichaam was vast, blank, zacht gebronsd door het licht;
uit heuren rooden mond kwam een adem, geuriger dan seringabloesem.
Zij zijn het, die, minneziek, 's avonds in waranden en hovingen
zwerven, ofwel in het diepst der bosschen, langs de lommerige paden,
op zoek naar de ziele eens mans, om de genieting der minne te
smaken. Zoodra een jongeling en zijne geliefde voorbij haar komen,
beproeven zij het meisje te dooden, of blazen het weerstand biedende
meideken liefdelust in, opdat zij heuren minnaar gehoor geve; want
dan krijgt de bloemenmaagd de helft van de kussen.
Nele en Uilenspiegel zagen ook uit het diepste der hemelen de
beschermgeesten der sterren nederdalen, alsmede de geniën van wind,
van dauw en van regen, gevleugelde jongelingen die de aarde bevruchten.
Dan verschenen aan alle punten des hemelrijks de vogelen der
zielen, de lieve zwaluwen. Met hunne komst scheen het licht
heller. Bloemenmaagden, vorsten der steenen en der bergen,
boschmannen, water-, vuur- en aardgeesten riepen allen te gader:
Licht! levenssap! glorie aan den koning Lente!
Hoewel het geschal van dien roep machtiger was dan 't geloei van de
woedende zee, en van 't losgeketend orkaan, klonk het als een zoete
muziek in de ooren van Nele en Uilenspiegel, die, stom en onbeweeglijk,
achter den knoestigen stam van een eikeboom neergehurkt zaten.
Maar heviger werd hunne vrees, toen de geesten, bij duizenden
zich zetten op zetels van reusachtige spinnekoppen, kikvorschen met
olifantssnuiten, ineengekronkelde slangen, krokodillen die recht op den
steert stonden en eene menigte geesten in den muil hielden, slangen die
meer dan dertig dwergen van beider kunne schrijlings op haar golvend
lijf droegen, en wel honderdduizend insecten, grooter dan reuzen,
gewapend met zweerden, spiesen, zeisen, vorken met zeven tanden,
en allerhande moordtuigen. Zij vochten met een ijselijk gedruisch,
en de sterken verslonden de zwakken, tot bewijs dat de Dood uit het
Leven en het Leven uit den Dood komt.
En uit heel de wemelende, dichte, verwarde menigte van geesten steeg
een gedruisch op, dat leek op het dof gerol van een verren donder en
het gerucht van honderden wevers, vollers, slotenmakers, die samen
aan den arbeid zijn.
Plotseling verschenen de geesten van het levenssap; zij waren kort,
dik, met lendenen zoo breed als het Heidelbergsche vat, dijen zoo dik
als wijnmudden, en spieren zoo forsig en sterk, dat men zou gezegd
hebben dat hun lichaam gemaakt was van groote en kleine eieren, het
een op het andere, met een rood vel overdekt, vettig en blinkend als
hun dunne baard en rossig haar; en in de handen hielden zij groote
bekers met een vreemdsoortig vocht.
Als de geesten ze zagen komen, ontstond er onder hen een groote
trilling van vreugde; boomen en planten bewogen zich en de aarde
scheurde open om te drinken.
En de geesten van het levenssap schonken wijn: terstond begon alles
te botten, te groeien, te bloeien; het gras was vol gonzende diertjes,
en de lucht vol vogels en pepels; de geesten schonken voort, en die van
beneden ontvingen den wijn zooals zij konden: de bloemenmaagden openden
den mond, of sprongen op heur rosse schenkers en kusten ze, om meer te
krijgen; de eenen vouwden de handen smeekend te zamen; anderen zaten
stille en lieten zich met wijn beregenen; doch allen, zoo dorstigen
als gelaafden, zochten den wijn en bij elk dropje dat zij kregen,
werden zij levendiger. En daar waren geene grijsaards, doch allen,
schoonen of leelijken, waren vol vinnige kracht en levende jeugd.
En zij lachten, riepen, zongen, terwijl zij elkander achtervolgden in
de boomen als eekhorentjes, in de lucht als vogelen; en elke man zocht
zijn wijfje en verrichtte onder Gods hemel het heilige werk der natuur.
En de geesten van het levenssap brachten aan den koning en aan de
koningin een grooten beker wijn. En de koning en de koningin dronken,
en kusten elkander.
Vervolgens omhelsde de koning de koningin, en hij stortte den beker
uit op boomen, bloemen en geesten, en riep:
--Glorie aan het Leven! glorie aan de vrije Lucht! glorie aan de
Kracht!
En allen riepen:
--Glorie aan de Natuur! glorie aan de Kracht!
En Uilenspiegel nam Nele in zijne armen. Aldus ineengestrengeld,
begon een dans, als een warreldans van droge bladeren in de macht
eener windhoos, in denwelke alles in beweging was, boomen, planten,
insecten, vlinders, hemel en aarde, koning en koningin, bloemenmaagden,
bergvorsten, watergeesten, gebochelde dwergen, vorsten der steenen,
boschmannen, lanteerndragers, beschermgeesten der sterren en de honderd
duizenden gruwelijke insecten, die hunne spiesen, zeisen en vorken met
zeven tanden ondereenmengden. En aan dien duiveldans, hollend door
de ruimte, namen de zon, de maan, de planeten, de sterren, de wind,
de wolken insgelijks deel.
De eik, waaraan Nele en Uilenspiegel zich vastklemden, draaide in de
dwarreling mee, en Uilenspiegel zeide tot Nele:
--Liefste, nu gaan wij sterven.
Een geest hoorde hen, en zag dat zij stervelingen waren.
--Aardelingen, sprak hij, aardelingen in dit oord!
En hij trok hen van den boom en smeet hen in 't gedrang. En
Uilenspiegel en Nele vielen zachtjes op den rug van de geesten,
die ze kaatsend naar malkander smeten en spraken:
--Gegroet, menschenkinderen! Welkom, aardwormen! Wie wil het knaapje
en het meideken? Zij komen ons bezoeken, de weekelingen.
--Genade! riepen Nele en Uilenspiegel, die van den een naar den
anderen vlogen.
Maar de geesten luisterden niet, en beiden vlogen in't ronde, met het
hoofd omlaag en de beenen omhoog, lijk pluimpjes in den winterwind,
terwijl de geesten spraken:
--Glorie aan de mannekens en aan de vrouwkens! Dat zij dansen als wij!
De bloemenmaagden wilden Uilenspiegel en Nele van malkander scheiden;
zij sloegen heur en hadden ze gedood, als de koning geen einde aan
den dans gesteld had, met deze woorden:
--Men brenge die beide aardwormen vóór mij!
Zij werden gescheiden; en elke bloemenmaagd trachtte Uilenspiegel
aan de andere te ontrukken, zeggende:
--Thijl, wilt gij sterven voor mij?
--Fluks, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
En de boschgeesten, die Nele droegen, zeiden:
--Waarom zijt gij geene ziel lijk wij, wij zouden u nemen!
--Hebt geduld, antwoordde Nele.
En zoo kwamen zij vóór den troon van den koning; en zij beefden,
als zij zijn gouden akst en zijn ijzeren kroon in het gezicht kregen.
Hij vroeg hun:
Wat komt gij hier doen, nietelingen?
Zij antwoordden niet?
--Ik ken u, tooveresseknop, voegde de koning er bij, en ook u,
kooldragerswelp; maar zoo gij door allerlei toovermiddelen in deze
werkplaats der Natuur zijt gedrongen, waarom houdt gij nu den bek
als volgepropte kapoenen?
Nele beefde als zij den verschrikkelijken duivel bezag, doch
Uilenspiegel hernam zijne mannelijke stoutmoedigheid en antwoordde:
--De assche van Klaas klopt op mijn hert. Doorluchtige vorst, in
naam des Pausen maait de Dood de krachtigste mannen, de bevalligste
vrouwlieden van Vlaanderenland; zijne privileges zijn verbroken, zijne
keuren vernietigd, de hongersnood ondermijnt het, zijne wollenwevers
verlaten het, om in den vreemde vrijen arbeid te zoeken. Het zal
sterven, als men het niet ter hulpe komt. Ik ben maar een arme
nieteling, die op de wereld kwam als een iegelijk, leefde als hij
kon, onvolmaakt, bekrompen, onwetend, geenszins deugdzaam, en de
menschelijke of goddelijke gratie teenemaal onweerdig. Doch Soetkin
stierf ten gevolge van de pijnen der tortuur en van droefheid, en
Klaas werd in een schrikkelijk vuur verbrand. Ik wilde hen wreken,
en ik deed het eenmaal; ik wilde dien bodem, bezaaid met de beenderen
zijner telgen, gelukkig zien, en vroeg aan God den dood zijner beulen,
maar hij aanhoorde mij niet. Moede van klagen, aanriep ik u door de
tooverkracht van Katelijne, en wij vallen u te voet, mijn bevende
gezellinne en ik, om u te bidden dit rampzalige land te verlossen.
De vorst en zijne vrouwe antwoordden samen:
    Door den krijg en door het vuur,
    Door den dood en door het zweerd,
      Zoek de Zeven.
    In den dood en in het bloed,
    In de puinen en de tranen,
      Vind de Zeven.
    Leelijk, wreede, boos, wanstaltig.
    Echte geesels der arme aarde,
      Brand de Zeven.
    Wacht, luister en zie,
    Zeg ons, kleine, zijt ge in uw schik niet?
      Vind de Zeven.
En al de geesten zongen samen:
    In den dood en in het bloed,
    In de puinen en de tranen,
      Zoek de Zeven.
    Wacht, luister en zie,
    Zeg ons, kleine, zijt ge in uw schik niet?
      Vind de Zeven.
--Maar, sprak Uilenspiegel, Hoogheid en gij, heeren geesten, ik
begrijp niets van uwe tale. Zeker spot gij met mij.
Doch zonder hem te aanhooren, gingen zij voort:
    Raakt het Noorden
    Kussend het Westen
    Rampspoed is uit.
    Vind de Zeven
    En den Gordel.
En dat met zooveel overeenstemming en machtigen maatklank, dat de aarde
beefde en de hemelen sidderden. En de vogelen floten, de raven krasten,
de musschen tjilpten, de nachtuilen kloegen en vlogen uitzinnig in
het ronde. En de dieren der aarde, leeuwen, slangen, beren, herten,
gemsen, wolven, honden en katten brulden, sisten, bromden, schreeuwden,
huilden, jankten, mauwden verschrikkelijk.
En de geesten zongen:
    Wacht, luister en zie,
    Heb de Zeven lief
      En den Gordel.
En de hanen kraaiden, en al de geesten verzwonden, buiten een booze
bergvorst, die Uilenspiegel en Nele elk bij een arm nam en ze vrij
onzacht naar beneden smeet.
Zij lagen naast elkander als om te slapen, als de frissche morgenwind
hen wakker maakte.
En Uilenspiegel zag Nele's lief gezicht, in gouden glans door de
rijzende zonne bestraald.
TWEEDE BOEK.
I.
Dien morgen, 't was in Herfstmaand, nam Uilenspiegel zijnen stok,
drie gulden die Katelijne hem gaf, eene snede brood met een stuk
verkenslever, en hij vertrok naar Antwerpen, op zoek naar de
Zeven. Nele sliep.
Onderwege werd hij gevolgd door een hond, die op den reuk van de
lever afkwam. Uilenspiegel wilde den hond wegjagen, maar deze bleef
halstarrig meeloopen, waarop Uilenspiegel hem de volgende rede hield:
--Hondje, mijn beestje, gij handelt verkeerd met uw huis te verlaten,
alwaar goede porties, lekkere kliekjes, mergbeenderen u wachten, om op
goed valle 't uit een zwerver te volgen, wien het zelfs aan wortelen
zal ontbreken om u toe te werpen. Geloof mij, onbezonnen hondje,
keer terug naar uwen baas. Vermijd regen, sneeuw, hagel, mist, ijzel
en andere liefelijkheden, die het lot van de zwervers zijn. Blijf u
warmen in den hoek van den heerd bij het lustige vuur, en laat mij
voortgaan in modder, in stof, in koude en hitte, heden gestoofd en
morgen bevroren, des Vrijdags verzadigd en 's Zondags verhongerd. Keer
terug van waar gij komt, hondje van weinig ondervinding, en gij zult
verstandig handelen.
Het beest scheen Uilenspiegel maar niet te begrijpen. Het
kwispelsteertte en sprong zoo hoog als het kon. Uilenspiegel meende
dat het uit vriendschap was, maar vergat de lever, die in zijne
tassche stak.
Hij ging voort, de hond volgde. Als zij alzoo bijna een uur gegaan
hadden, zagen zij op de baan eene kar, bespannen met een ezeltje,
dat den kop liet hangen. Op den berm van den weg, tusschen twee
distelstruiken, zat een man met in eene hand eenen hamelbout en in
de andere eene bottel, waaraan hij zich goed deed. Als hij niet at
of dronk, zuchtte en weeklaagde hij.
Uilenspiegel stond stil, de hond insgelijks. Bout en lever riekend,
beklom hij den berm. Daar ging hij nabij den man op zijn achterste
zitten, krabde aan zijn wambuis, om beetjes te vragen, doch de man
stiet hem terug met den elleboog, en zuchtte erbarmelijk met den bout
omhoog. De hond jankte uit begeerlijkheid; en de ezel, grammoedig
omdat hij, ingespannen, de distelen niet kon bereiken, begon te balken.
--Wat is er, Jan? vroeg de man tot den ezel.
--Niets, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, maar hij zou zich willen vergasten
aan de distelen, die naast u groeien; en deze hond zou evenmin boos
zijn, nadere kennis te maken met het been, dat gij in de hand hebt. In
afwachting daarvan, kan hij beginnen met de lever, die ik hier heb.
Toen de hond de lever binnen had, keek de man naar zijnen bout. Hij
beet er het laatste vleesch af, gaf toen het been aan den hond,
die er zijn pooten op stelde en het trachtte te kraken.
Toen keek de man naar Uilenspiegel.
Deze herkende Lamme Goedzak, van Damme.
--Lamme, vroeg hij, waarom zit gij hier te eten, te drinken en te
jammeren? Heeft een soldaat u misschien eene schudding gegeven?
--Laas! mijne vrouw! sprak Lamme.
Hij wilde zijne bottel wijn ledigen, maar Uilenspiegel hield hem tegen.
--Drink zoo niet, sprak hij, al te haastig doet geen deugd aan de
nieren. Beter zou het komen aan hem, die geene bottel op zak heeft.
--Ge spreekt goed, antwoordde Lamme, maar zoudt gij beter drinken?
En hij langde hem de bottel.
Uilenspiegel nam ze, dronk en gaf ze hem terug.
--Ge moogt mij Maraan heeten, sprak hij, als er genoeg overbleef voor
eene musch.
Lamme bezag de bottel, zuchtte en nam uit zijne tassche een andere
flesch en een stuk worst, dat hij in schijfjes sneed en weemoedig opat.
Eet gij standvastig, Lamme? vroeg Uilenspiegel.
--Veelal, mijn jongen, antwoordde Lamme, maar 't is om mijne droeve
gedachten te verjagen. Waar zijt gij, vrouwtje? weeklaagde hij,
terwijl hij een traan uit het het oog wischte.
En hij sneed tien schijfjes van de worst.
--Lamme, sprak Uilenspiegel, eet niet zoo gulzig en zonder medelijden
voor den armen pelgrim.
Lamme reikte hem weenend vier schijfjes en Uilenspiegel zuchtte om
den fijnen smaak.
Maar steeds weenend en etend, sprak Lamme:
Mijne vrouw, mijne goede vrouw, ze was zoo zoet en zoo goed gevormd van
lichaam, licht als de vlinder, vlug als de bliksem, en zij zong als een
leeuwerik! Maar toch hield zij te veel van schoone kleeren. Laas! zij
hingen heur zoo goed! Immers, hebben de bloemen ook geen schitterenden
dos? Zie, hadt gij heure handjes gezien, die tot streelen gemaaakt
schenen, nooit hadt gij heur potten of pateelen laten aanraken. Het
vuur van de keuken hadde heure hagelblanke tint verzengd. En die
oogen! Ik moest ze maar bezien, en ik verging van liefde.--Drink
een slok wijn, Thijl, 'k zal na u drinken.--Ha! waarom is zij niet
dood! Ik deed alles in huis, om heur den minsten arbeid te sparen:
ik veegde den vloer, maakte het huwelijksbed, in hetwelk zij zich
's avonds behaaglijk uitstrekte, ik waschte de schotels, alsmede het
linnen, hetwelk ik zelven ook streek.--Eet, Thijl, 't is Gentsche
worst.--Soms, als zij gaan wandelen was, kwam zij te laat naar huis
voor het noenmaal, maar heur zien was zulk een groote vreugde voor mij,
dat ik niet kijven dorst, hoogst gelukkig nog, als ze mij 's nachts
den rug niet toekeerde. Ik heb alles verloren.--Drink dien wijn, Thijl,
't is Brusselsche wijn, bereid naar de wijze van Bourgondië.
--En waarom liet zij u zitten? vroeg Uilenspiegel.
--Weet ik het? hernam Lamme Goedzak. Waar is de tijd, als ik ten
narent kwam om heure hand te vragen, en zij vluchtte,--uit vreeze en
uit liefde? Als heure armen bloot waren, schoone, ronde, en blanke
armen, sloeg zij plotseling heure mouwen neer als zij zag, dat ik
er naar keek. Andere malen mocht ik heur zoenen, en 'k kuste heure
schoone oogen, die zij dicht hield van zalig genot; dan trilde zij
en slaakte kleine kreten, of boog heur hoofd achterover en gaf er
mij een stoot op den neus mee. En zij lachte als ik riep: Ai! en ik
gaf haar dan kleine duwtjes, want tusschen ons was niets anders dan
gestoei en gejoel.--Thijl, is er nog wijn in die bottel?
--Ja, sprak Uilenspiegel.
Lamme dronk en ging voort:
--Andere reizen viel ze vol minne rond mijnen hals en zei: gij zijt
schoon! En honderd maal kuste ze mij op de kaken of op 't voorhoofd,
maar nooit op den mond. En als ik vroeg waarom, antwoordde zij
blozend, dat moeder heur vroeger dikwijls gewaarschuwd had dat dit voor
meidekens gevaarlijk is. Ha! zoete oogenblikken, zalige tijd!--Thijl,
zie eens of gij soms een hammetje vindt in de weitasch?
--Een half, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
Uilenspiegel gaf het hem en Lamme at het heel op.
--Dat hammetje deed mij deugd, sprak Uilenspiegel, als Lamme gedaan
had.
--Mij ook, sprak deze. Maar nooit zal ik mijn liefste terugzien,
zij is weggeloopen uit Damme. Rijdt gij mede om ze te zoeken?
--Ik wil wel, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Maar, sprak Lamme, is er niets meer in de bottel?
--Geen droppel, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
En zij stegen in de kar, getrokken door grauwtje, dat weemoedig balkte
om het vertrek aan te kondigen.
Maar de hond was--als hij goed zijne bekomst had--er stillekens van
door gegaan.
II.
De kar reed op den dijk, tusschen eenen vijver en eene vaart,
en droomerig drukte Uilenspiegel de assche van Klaas tegen zijne
borst. Hij vroeg zich af of het visioen leugen of waarheid was,
of die geesten met hem den spot gedreven hadden, of wel hem op
raadselachtige wijze gezegd hadden wat hij doen moest om 't land
zijner vaderen gelukkig te maken.
En te vergeefs trachtte hij te vatten, wat de Zeven en de Gordel
bediedden.
Aan den dooden keizer, den levenden koning, de landvoogden, den paus
van Rome, den groot-inquisiteur, den generaal der jezuïeten denkend,
vond hij in hen zes groote beulen, die hij onverwijld levend had
willen verbranden. Maar hij dacht, dat er van hen geen sprake was,
dat zij zelven te geerne anderen brandden, dat hij elders moest zoeken.
En gedurig herhaalde hij in zich zelven:
    Raakt het Noorden
    Kussend het Westen
    Rampspoed is uit.
    Vind de Zeven
    En den Gordel.
--Laas, sprak hij, in dood, bloed en puinen, Zeven vinden, Zeven
branden, Zeven minnen! Mijn arme geest wordt gefolterd, want wie dan
verbrandt zijne minne?
De kar had reeds een eind wegs afgelegd; zij hoorden een gekraak van
stappen in het zand en eene stemme, die zong:
    Gij, die voorbij trekt, zaagt ge wel
    Mijn vriend, mijn vrijer, snaaksch en snel?
    Hij zwerft nu hierent en darent.
    Zaagt ge hem wel?
    Gelijk op een lam een arent,
    Viel hij op een hartken fel.
    Baardloos, een man als niemendel.
    Zaagt ge hem wel?
    Ontmoet gij hem, zeg dat Nele
    Vermoeid is van te gaan zoo snel.
    Waar toeft ge lieve Thijl, vertel:
    Zaagt ge hem wel?
    Een tortel in den abeele
    Treurt om haar verloren gezel.
    Alzoo menig trouwe gespele.
    Zaagt ge hem wel?
Uilenspiegel klopte op Lamme's buik en zei:
--Houd uwen adem in, dikzak.
--Laas, antwoordde Lamme, 't is lastig voor iemand, die zoo dik is.
Doch Uilenspiegel liet hem praten; hij verborg zich achter de huif van
de kar, en de stemme nabootsend van een die bedronken is, neurde hij:
    Uw vriend en vrijer zag ik wel
    Op een kar van 't oud model,
    Met een papzak voor gezel,
    Zag ik hem wel!
--Thijl, zei Lamme, ge zingt leelijk dezen morgen.
Zonder naar hem te luisteren, stak Uilenspiegel het hoofd door een
gat van de huif.
--Nele, herkent gij mij? riep hij.
Verschrikt, weenend en lachend te gelijk, want heure kaken waren nat,
sprak zij:
--Ik zie u, leelijke deugniet!
--Nele, sprak Uilenspiegel, als ge mij wilt slaan, heb ik thuis
eenen stok. Hij slaat goed, en laat merkteekenen na, want hij is
zwaar en knoestig.
--Thijl, vroeg Nele, gaat gij naar de Zeven?
Ja, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
Nele droeg eene weitasch, die proppensvol stak. Zij langde die aan
Uilenspiegel en sprak:
--Thijl, ik heb gedacht dat het voor een man ongezond is van op reis
te gaan, zonder een goede vette gans, een hesp en wat Gentsche worsten
bij zich. En dit moet gij eten te mijner gedenkenis.
Daar Uilenspiegel Nele bezag en er geenszins aan dacht de weitasch
te nemen, stak Lamme het hoofd door een ander gat van de huif en sprak:
--Meideken vol voorzienigheid, als hij niet aanpakt, is 't uit
verlegenheid. Maar geef mij die hesp, die gans en die worsten: ik
zal ze bewaren voor hem en ze beschermen.
--Welk een tronie is mij dat? vroeg Nele.
't Is, sprak Uilenspiegel, een slachtoffer van het huwelijk, die met
het herte vol wee, zou uitdrogen lijk een stoksken, zoo hij zich niet
stevig hield door dag en nacht te eten en te drinken.
--Zoo is het, mijn zoon, zuchtte Lamme.
De heldere zon drukte loodzwaar op Nele's hoofd. Zij dekte zich met
haar voorschoot. Daar Uilenspiegel met heur alleen wilde zijn, zei
hij tot Lamme:
--Ziet gij ginder die vrouw in de meersch?
--Ja, zei Lamme.
--Herkent gij ze niet?
--Daar? vroeg Lamme, zou het de mijne zijn? Zij is niet gekleed als
een poorteresse.
--Twijfelt gij nog, blinde mol? sprak Uilenspiegel.
--En als zij het niet was?
--Daar zoudt gij niets bij verliezen, want op de linkerhand, naar
het Noorden, is een kaberdoesken waar men lekker bruinbier tapt. Daar
zullen wij u vinden. En hier is hesp, om u te vergezelschappen.
Lamme kwam uit de kar en liep met groote schreden naar de vrouw in
de meersch.
Uilenspiegel vroeg tot Nele:
--Waarom komt ge niet bij mij?
Toen hielp hij heur in den wagen en deed hij ze naast hem zitten;
hij nam heure huik van den schouderen, en heur honderd kussen gevend,
sprak hij:
--Waar gingt ge heen, liefste?
Zij antwoordde niet, doch scheen heel vervoerd en begeesterd. En
Uilenspiegel, vervoerd als zij, zegde tot haar:
--Ik heb u zoo geerne naast mij. De wilde roze heeft niet de zachte
tint uwer donzige huid. Ge zijt wel geen koninginne, doch laat mij
maar eene krone van kussen maken voor u. Lieve, zoete armen, die God
maakte tot koozerij! Ha! liefste, ik vrees, dat mijn ruwe handen die
schouders verwelken! De lichte vlinder rust op de purperen anjelier,
maar hoe zal ik op uwe blankheid rusten, opdat ze niet verwelkt? God
is in den hemel, de koning zit op zijnen troon en de zonne glinstert
ginder aan 't uitspansel; maar ik ben God en koning en het licht, daar
ik zoo dicht bij u wezen mag! O, dat haar is zachter dan zijde! Nele,
ik ben ruw en wild, doch wees zonder vreeze! Die lieve voetjes! Hoe
komt het, dat zij zoo wit zijn? Pleegt gij ze te wasschen met melk?
Zij wilde opstaan.
Wat vreest gij? vroeg Uilenspiegel, toch niet de zonne, die op ons
schijnt en u teenenmale in 't goud zet? Sla uwe oogen niet neder. Zie
in de mijne, welk heerlijk vuur er brandt. Luister, liefste mijne;
't is het stille middaguur, de landman keert huiswaarts; hij leeft
van brood; maar wij, laat ons van liefde leven! Duizend jaren lang
zou ik aan uwe voeten willen doorbrengen.
--Mooispreker! zegde zij.
De zonne straalde, een leeuwerik tierelierde boven de klaveren,
en Nele legde heur hoofdje op den schouder van Uilenspiegel.
III.
Maar Lamme kwam zweetend en blazend terug.
Laas! sprak hij, ik ben onder een slecht gesternte geboren. Nadat
ik mij het hert afgeloopen had achter die vrouw, zag ik, dat het de
mijne niet was en reeds bedaagd; ze moest diep in de veertig zijn,
en aan heure kap zag ik, dat ze nooit getrouwd geweest was. Ze vroeg
mij bits wat ik met mijn dikken buik in heure klaveren kwam doen?
Ik zoek mijne vrouw, die mij liet zitten, antwoordde ik zachtjes,
en daar ik u nam voor haar, liep ik naar u toe.
Op die rede zegde de oude jongedochter, dat ik kon terugkeeren waar ik
van daan kwam; dat, als mijne vrouw mij liet zitten, het wel besteed
was, want dat al de mannen truwanten, dieven en ketteren zijn, die
alle meisjes willen verleiden en dat, als ik niet dadelijk opkraamde,
ze mij door heuren hond zou doen opvreten.
En niet zonder schroom pakte ik mijne biezen, want een groote hond
lag aan heure voeten te brommen. Als ik van heur land was, zette
ik mij neer op den wegel en at ik uw stuk hesp, om op mijn effen
te komen. Plotseling hoorde ik een geritsel achter mij en, als ik
mij omkeerde, zag ik den grooten hond van de oude jongedochter;
doch nu bromde hij niet meer, integendeel, hij kwispelsteertte en
zag mij begeerig aan, om de hesp. Ik smeet hem eenige stukskens toe,
maar zijne meesteresse kwam bij en riep:
--Pak hem! pak hem! manneken!
En ik op den loop, en de groote hond achter mij; hij beet mij in mijn
been. Maar terwijl ik schreeuwde van pijn, gaf ik hem met mijnen stok
eenen slag op zijne voorpooten, dat er ten minste één van gebroken
is. Hij viel en jammerde in zijne hondentaal: "Genade", die ik hem
verleende. Ondertusschen smeet zijne meesteresse kluiten aarde naar
mij, bij gebreke aan steenen, en ik weer op den loop!
Laas! is het niet wreed en onrechtveerdig voor eene vrouw, zich op
een onschuldigen jongen als ik te wreken, omdat zij niet schoon genoeg
is om aan eenen man te geraken?
En treurig stapte ik naar het kaberdoesken, dat gij mij gewezen
hadt, om met bruinbier mijnen schrik af te drinken. Maar ik was
nogmaals bedrogen, want als ik binnenkwam, zag ik man en vrouw
bezig met vechten. Ik vroeg, dat zij zouden uitscheiden om mij eenen
pot bruinbier te tappen, al was 't maar eene pinte of zeven; maar
de vrouw, een echte stokvisch, antwoordde mij woedend, dat als ik
niet dadelijk wegkwam, zij mij in kennis zou brengen met den blok,
waarmede zij op den kop van heuren man trommelde. En nu ben ik hier,
vriend, zweetend en af van vermoeidheid; hebt gij niets te eten?
--'t Doet, zei Uilenspiegel.
En Lamme slaakte eenen zucht van verlichting.
IV.
En ze reden samen voort. De ezel, met hangende ooren, trok traagzaam
de kar.
--Lamme, sprak Uilenspiegel, wij zijn gevieren: de ezel, die op goed
geluk naar distelen zoekt; gij, dikzak, die uwe wederhelft achternazit;
zij, de teedere en zoete geliefde, die iemand vindt, harer onweerdig,
't is te zeggen mij, den vierde.
Nu, kinderen, moed! de bladeren worden geel, en de hemel zal helderder
worden; weldra zal, in de najaarsnevelen, de zonne ondergaan, en de
winter zal verschijnen, als het beeld van den dood, om allen, die
onder onze voeten liggen, met een sneeuwen lijkwade te dekken. En
ik zal optrekken voor de redding van Vlaanderenland. Arme dooden:
Soetkin stierf van smerte; Klaas door den viere: eik van goedheid en
eiloof van liefde; ik, uw zoon, ik lijd grootelijks en zal u wreken,
assche, die ik zoo liefheb, die klopt op mijne borst.
Lamme sprak:
--Gij moogt ze niet beweenen, die voor de gerechtigheid stierven.
Maar Uilenspiegel bleef nadenken; eensklaps zegde hij:
--Nele, het uur van scheiden is gekomen en 't zal voor lang zijn;
wie weet, of ik uw lief gelaat ooit wederzie.
Nele bezag hem met heure oogen, die glinsterden als sterren, en sprak:
--Stap van den wagen en kom met mij in het bosch, alwaar gij lekker
eten zult vinden; want ik ken de kruiden en kan de vogelkens bijroepen.
--Meisje, sprak Lamme, 't is slecht van uwentwege, Uilenspiegel te
willen ophouden, die naar de Zeven moet zoeken en mijne vrouw helpen
terugvinden.
--Nog niet! sprak Nele, en zij weende: doch lachte, te midden heurer
tranen, Uilenspiegel liefderijk toe.
Dit ziende antwoordde deze:
--Uw vrouw zult gij wel intijds terugvinden, als gij lust naar nieuwe
smert zult gevoelen.
--Thijl, sprak Lamme, gaat ge mij, voor dat meisje, in mijne kar alleen
laten? Gij antwoordt niet en denkt aan het woud, waar de Zeven niet
zijn, en mijne vrouw evenmin. Help ze liever zoeken op dezen steenweg,
waar de kar zoo gemakkelijk rijdt.
--Lamme, sprak Uilenspiegel, er ligt een volle weitasch in de kar,
gij zult dus niet sterven van honger, als gij van hier naar Koolkerke
gaat, alwaar ik bij U kom. Gij moet er alleen zijn, want daar zult
gij vernemen naar welke windstreek gij u richten moet, om uwe vrouw te
vinden. Luister. Gij rijdt stapvoets naar Koolkerke, op drie uren van
hier. Op den toren draait een windhaan met alle winden mee op zijn
roestige hengsels. Dat geknars wijst aan de arme mannen, die hunne
liefste verloren, den weg, langs welken zij haar zullen terugvinden.
Maar vooreerst moet men met een hazelaarstaksken, zeven reizen, op elk
muurvlak slaan. Als de hengsels knarsen, terwijl de wind uit 't noorden
blaast, is 't die kant dien gij nemen moet, doch met omzichtigheid,
want Noordenwind is oorlogswind; blaast hij uit 't Zuiden, ga dan
maar blijgemoed: 't is minnewind; uit het Oosten, loop dan gezwind:
't is licht en en vroolijkheid; uit het Westen, ga traagzaam, want
die wind brengt regen en tranen. Ga, Lamme, en wacht mij te Koolkerke.
--Ik zal, zei Lamme.
En hij reed voort met de kar.
Terwijl Lamme naar Koolkerke reed, joeg de sterke, zoele wind de grijze
wolkjes als een kudde schapen door het luchtruim. Uilenspiegel en Nele
waren alleen in het woud. Uilenspiegel had honger en Nele zocht naar
heerlijke vruchten, doch vond niets anders dan eikels, en de kussen,
die heur vriend heur in overvloed gaf.
Uilenspiegel had strikken gespannen en floot om de vogels bij
te roepen, ten einde diegenen te braden, die zich zouden laten
vangen. Een nachtegaal kwam omtrent Nele op de bladeren zitten; zij
ving hem niet, om hem te laten voortzingen; toen kwam een grasmusch,
en zij had er medelijden mee, omdat zij zoo lief en zoo hupsch was;
vervolgens kwam een leeuwerik, maar Nele zei hem, dat hij beter zou
doen hoog in de lucht te vliegen en de Natuur te bezingen, dan dom
weg te komen dartelen boven de doodelijke punt van een braadspit.
En 't was de waarheid, want inmiddels had Uilenspiegel een vuur
aangestoken en een braadspit gesneden, dat op niets anders wachtte
dan op lichtzinnige slachtofferen.
Maar de vogelen kwamen niet meer bij, tenzij eenige kwaadaardige raven,
die hoog boven hunne hoofden krasten.
En zoo kwam het, dat Uilenspiegel niemendal te eten had.
Doch Nele moest vertrekken en bij Katelijne terugkeeren. En weenend
ging zij haren weg op, en Uilenspiegel keek heur droef achterna.
Maar ze kwam terug en viel hem om den hals.
--Ik ga henen, sprak zij.
Zij ging, doch opnieuw keerde ze terug, zeggende:
--Ik ga henen.
En zoo wel twintig reizen en nog meer.
Eindelijk vertrok zij, en Uilenspiegel bleef alleen. Toen ging hij
ook henen om Lamme weder te vinden.
Als hij bij hem was, zat Lamme aan den voet van den toren, met
een grooten pot bruinbier tusschen zijne beenen, weemoedg op een
hazelaarstakje te bijten.
--Uilenspiegel, sprak hij, ik geloof, dat ge mij maar weggezonden
hebt, om met 't meideken alleen te blijven; ik heb met den hazelaar
zeven reizen op elk vlak van den toren geslagen, en hoewel de wind
blaast als een duivel, toch hebben de hengsels niet geknarst.
--Men zal ze zeker gesmeerd hebben, antwoordde Uilenspiegel. Vervolgens
togen ze henen naar het hertogdom Brabant.

Dagen en nachten bracht Philippus tusschen zijne papieren en
perkamenten door. Aan hen vertrouwde hij de gedachten van zijn
ongevoelig herte. Daar hij nooit bemind had, maar ook wist dat niemand
hem liefhad, wilde hij zelf zijn onmetelijk rijk bestieren, en de
droefgeestige Atlas bukte onder den last. Weemoed en bovenmatige
arbeid ondermijnden zijn zwak lichaam. Hij had een afschuw van een
blij gezicht en daarom een haat tegen onze lachende landen; tegen onze
kooplieden, om hunne weelde en hunnen rijkdom; tegen onzen adel, om
zijne vrijmoedigheid en het vuur zijner kloeke blijgeestigheid. Hij
wist--men had het hem gezegd--dat lang reeds vóór dat kardinaal
de Couza, omtrent het jaar 1380, op de misbruiken der Kerk en op
de noodzakelijkheid der hervormingen gewezen had, de opstand tegen
Paus en de Roomsche Kerk, die zich in onze landen onder verschillende
sektevormen geuit had, in de gemoederen borrelde als kokend water in
een ketel.
Hij geloofde, de koppige, dat zijn wil op de gansche wereld
drukken moest als de wil van God; hij wilde, dat onze landen die
de gehoorzaamheid ontwend waren, bogen onder het oude juk, zonder
eenige hervorming te erlangen. Hij wilde, dat Zijne Heilige Moeder:
de Katholieke, Apostolische en Roomsche kerk één, geheel en algemeen,
ongewijzigd en onveranderd zou zijn, alléén omdat hij het wilde,
en alzoo handelde hij als een onredelijke vrouw. En 's nachts woelde
hij in zijn bed als op een leger van doornen, werd hij onophoudelijk
gefolterd door zijne gedachten.
--Ja, Heilige Philippus, Heere God, al moest ik van de Nederlanden
één kerkhof maken, tot U zullen zij komen, mijn beschermer, tot U,
Heiligen des hemelrijks.
En hij beproefde te doen wat hij zeide, zich aldus Roomscher toonend
dan de Paus en katholieker dan de kerkvergaderingen.
En Uilenspiegel en Lamme, en het volk van Vlaanderen en van de
Nederlanden, zagen, met angstvolle herten, van verre, in de sombere
halle van 't Escuriaal, die gekroonde spinnekop, met heure lange,
ruige pooten, heure geopende grijpers, het net spannen, dat hen vangen
moest om het beste van hun bloed te zuigen.
Hoewel, onder de regeering van keizer Karel, de pauselijke inquisitie
honderd duizend Christenen gedood had: hoewel de goederen dier
martelaren in de kisten van keizer en koning gevloeid waren als
regen in eene goot, oordeelde Philippus dat dit niet voldoende was,
en hij legde den lande de nieuwe bisdommen op en wilde er de Spaansche
inquisitie invoeren.
En overal lazen de stadsherauten, bij geschal van bazuinen, en geroffel
van trommen, de plakkaten af waarbij kond werd gegeven, dat al de
ketteren, met den viere zouden sterven als zij hunne dolingen niet
afzwoeren, en met de koorde als zij die wel zouden afgaan. Vrouwen
en meidekens zouden levend begraven worden, en de beul zou op heure
lichamen dansen.
En als een vuur zette de wederstand zich door heel het land voort.
VI.
Den vijfden van de grasmaand, vóór Paschen, gingen de heeren Lodewijk
van Nassau, Kuilenburg en Brederode, met driehonderd edellieden het
hof van Brussel binnen, bij Mevrouwe de landvoogdes, hertoginne van
Parma. In rangen van vieren beklommen zij de groote trap van 't paleis.
Binnengeleid in de zaal waar Mevrouwe zich bevond, boden zij heur
een klaagschrift aan, bij hetwelk zij heure tusschenkomst vroegen om
den koning te bewegen, de plakkaten op 't stuk der religie, alsmede
de Spaansche inquisitie op te heffen, verklarende, dat er in onze
misnoegde landen anders niets uit kon voortvloeien dan muiterij,
puinhoopen en algemeene ellende.
En dat verzoekschrift werd Het Eedverbond geheeten.
Berlaymont, die later zoo valsch en wreed was voor den grond zijner
vaderen, stond naast Hare Hoogheid en sprak, om te spotten met de
armoede dier edele eedgenooten:
--Mevrouwe vrees niets, het zijn maar geuzen!
Daarmede wilde hij zeggen, dat die edelen en smalle jonkers ondergegaan
waren in dienst des konings of door in weelde te wedijveren met de
Spaansche edellieden.
Om de woorden van Berlaymont met verachting te bejegenen, verklaarden
zij er eere in te stellen "geuzen" geheeten en genaamd te worden,
voor den dienst des konings en het welzijn dezer landen.
Zij besloten een gouden penning te dragen, met de beeltenis des
konings op de eene zijde, en op de andere twee ineengelegde handen,
saamgesnoerd door de riemen van eenen bedelzak, en deze woorden: "Den
koning getrouw tot den bedelzak". En op hunne hoeden en mutsen droegen
zij ook gouden juweelen in den vorm van nappen en van bedelaarsmutsen.
Intusschentijd liep Lamme met zijn dikken buik door de stad, op zoek
naar zijne vrouw, maar hij vond ze niet.
VII.
Op een morgen zei Uilenspiegel tot Lamme:
--Kom mede: wij gaan een grooten, edelen, machtigen, geduchten heere
groeten.
--Zal hij mij zeggen waar mijne vrouw is? vroeg Lamme?
--Als hij het weet, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
En zij gingen bij Brederode, den machtigen drinker.
Hij was in het binnenhof van zijn paleis.
--Wat wilt gij? vroeg hij tot Uilenspiegel.
--U spreken heer! antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Spreek, zegde Brederode.
--Gij zijt, sprak Uilenspiegel, een schoon, dapper en krachtig
man. Eens hebt gij een Franschman in zijn harnas versmacht, als eene
mossel in hare schelp; doch zijt gij sterk en dapper, gij zijt mede
verstandig. Waarom dan draagt gij dien penning, waarop te lezen staat:
"Den koning getrouw tot den bedelzak"?
--Ja, heer, waarom? vroeg Lamme.
Doch Brederode antwoordde niet en keek Uilenspiegel scherp in de
oogen. Deze ging voort:
--Waarom wilt gij, edele heeren, den koning getrouw tot den bedelzak
blijven? Is 't voor het goede, dat hij u gunt, of de vriendschap,
die hij u toedraagt? Waarom, in stee van hem getrouw te zijn tot
den bedelzak, verlost gij niet liever onze landen van dien beul,
die met volle gerechtigheid zelf den bedelzak diende te dragen?
En Lamme knikte, tot teeken dat hij daarmede instemde.
Brederode bezag Uilenspiegel met zijn levendigen blik, lachte en sprak:
--Als gij geen spion van koning Philippus zijt, zijt gij een goed
Vlaming, en ik ga u loonen voor de beide gevallen.
Hij bracht hem naar de keuken en Lamme volgde hem. Daar trok hij hem
tot bloedens bij de ooren.
--Dit is voor den spion, sprak Brederode.
Uilenspiegel schreeuwde niet.
--Breng, zegde hij tot zijn bottelier, breng hier dien moor met
kaneel-wijn.
De bottelier bracht den moor en een grooten beker warmen, geurigen
wijn.
--Drink, sprak Brederode tot Uilenspiegel, dit is voor den goeden
Vlaming.
--Ha! sprak Uilenspiegel, wat schoone tale spreekt die wijn met kaneel;
zoo spreken de santen zeker in het hemelrijk niet!
Als hij de helft van den wijn uitgedronken had, gaf hij de rest
aan Lamme.
--Wie is die papzak daar, vroeg Brederode, die beloond wordt om niets
te doen?
--'t Is mijn vriend Lamme, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, telkens dat hij
warmen wijn drinkt, verbeeldt hij zich, dat hij zijne vrouw gaat
terugvinden.
--Ja! sprak Lamme, den beker devotelijk ledigend.
--Waar gaat gij nu? vroeg Brederode.
--Wij gaan, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, op zoek naar de Zeven, die
Vlaanderenland moeten verlossen.
--Welke Zeven? vroeg Brederode.
Als ik ze gevonden heb, zal ik u zeggen wie ze zijn, antwoordde
Uilenspiegel.
Maar Lamme, dien de wijn vroolijk gemaakt had, vroeg:
--Thijl, als wij eens in de maan naar mijne vrouw gingen zoeken?
--Waar is de ladder? vroeg Uilenspiegel.
In Mei, de groote Bloeimaand, sprak Uilenspiegel tot Lamme:
--Daar is de schoone Bloeimaand, de heldere, blauwe hemel! De
takken der boomen zien rood van levenssap, de grond baart welige
groeikracht. Dat is het oogenblik om te hangen en te branden voor het
geloof. Daar zijn zij, de goede ketterjagers. Wat edele gezichten! Zij
hebben het vermogen een iegelijk te straffen, te tuchtigen, af te
zetten, aan de wereldlijke rechters over te leveren, en ook hun eigen
gevangenis te hebben.--Ha! wat een schoone Bloeimaand!--in hechtenis
nemen, in rechte vervolgen zonder vorm van proces, branden, hangen,
onthalzen en vrouwen en meidekens voorbarig begraven. De vinken slaan
in de boomen. De goede kettermeesters houden de rijken in 't oog. En
de koning zal erven. Gaat, meidekens, gaat dansen in de beemden,
bij geschal van pijpen en schalmeien. Ho! de schoone Bloeimaand.
De assche van Klaas klopte op Uilenspiegel's borst.
--Laat ons gaan, sprak hij tot Lamme. Gelukkig zij, die het hert hoog
en het zweerd gereed houden in de sombere dagen, die op handen zijn.
VIII.
Uilenspiegel kwam eens, in de Oogstmaand, op den Vlaamschen steenweg,
te Brussel, voorbij de woning van Jan Sapermillemente, aldus genoemd
omdat zijn grootvader, als hij kwaad was, met dien uitroep placht te
vloeken, om den zeer heiligen naam Gods niet te lasteren noch ijdelijk
te gebruiken. Gemelde Sapermillemente was meester-borduurder; doch
daar hij zich blind en doof gedronken had, borduurde zijne vrouw--een
oud wijf met een bitsige tronie--de kleederen, wambuizen, mantels en
schoenen der heeren. Hare bevallige dochter was haar behulpzaam in
dien goedbetaalden arbeid.
Toen Uilenspiegel bij het vallen van den avond voorbij hunne woning
ging, zag hij het meideken aan 't venster en hoorde hij heur neuren:
        Oogst, oogst,
    Zeg mij, zoete maand,
    Wie neemt er mij als vrouw;
    Zeg mij, zoete maand?
--Ik, zei Uilenspiegel, als gij wilt.
--Wie, ik? vroeg zij. Kom nader, dat ik u zie.
Doch Uilenspiegel vroeg:
--Hoe komt het, dat gij in Oogstmaand roept hetgeen de Brabantsche
meidekens plegen te roepen in den vooravond van Lentemaand?
--Omdat zij maar ééne maand hebben die een man geeft, en ik er
twaalf heb. Op den vooravond van elke maand, niet te middernacht,
doch zes uren lang tot middernacht, spring ik uit mijn bed, ga ik
drie stappen achterweerts naar het venster en zing ik het liedeken;
vervolgens keer ik terug naar mijn bed, met drie stappen achterweerts,
en te middernacht ga ik slapen om te droomen van den mij bestemden
echtgenoot. Maar de maanden zijn spotters van nature, en 't is niet
van één man dat ik droom, maar van twaalf te gelijk; gij zijt de
dertiende, zoo gij lust hebt.
--De andere zouden jaloersch zijn, antwoordde Uilenspiegel. Gij ook
roept: "Verlossing!"
Het meideken bloosde en sprak:
--Ik roep om verlossing en weet wat ik vraag.
--Ik weet het insgelijks en breng het u mede, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Gij moet wachten, zeide zij glimlachend en daarbij liet zij heure
schoone tanden zien.
Wachten, sprak Uilenspiegel, neen. Een huis kan op mijn hoofd vallen,
de wind mij in eene beek smijten, een dolle hond in mijn been bijten;
neen, wachten doe ik niet.
--Ik ben nog te jong, sprak ze, en roep maar naar het aloud gebruik.
Uilenspiegel werd achterdochtig, als hij er aan dacht, dat het op
Maartavond en geenszins in de Oogstmaand was, dat de Brabantsche
meidekens naar een man riepen.
Glimlachend herhaalde zij:
--Ik ben nog te jong en roep maar naar het aloud gebruik.
--Gaat gij wachten totdat gij te oud zijt? 't Ware jammer! Nog nooit
zag ik zoo'n ronden hals, zoo'n blanken boezem, een Vlaamschen boezem
vol goede melk, die kloeke mannen maakt.
--Vol? sprak zij, nog niet; gij zijt er rap bij, gij!
--Wachten? herhaalde Uilenspiegel; totdat ik geene tanden meer heb
om u levend op te eten, liefste? Gij antwoordt niet en glimlacht met
uw lichtbruine oogen en uwe lippen als kersen zoo rood!
Het meisje bezag hem met een onderzoekenden blik en antwoordde:
--Van waar komt al die liefde in eens? Wat doet gij? Zijt gij een
bedelaar, of zijt gij rijk?
--Bedelaar ben ik, sprak hij, en rijk al te gader, als gij mij
toehoort, liefste.
Zij antwoordde:
--Dat is 't niet wat ik wil weten. Gaat gij naar de misse? Zijt
gij goed Christene? Zoudt gij durven zeggen, dat gij een bedelaar,
een echte bedelaar, een geus zijt, die opstaat tegen de plakkaten en
tegen de inquisitie?
De assche van Klaas klopte op Uilenspiegel's borst.
--Ik ben geus, sprak hij, dood en opgevreten door de wormen wil ik
de verdrukkers onzer Nederlanden zien! Gij beziet mij, liefste. Dat
liefdevuur, dat voor u brandt, is het vuur van de jeugd. God stak
het aan, het brandt lijk de zonne gloort, totdat het uitdoove. Doch
God stak ook het vuur aan der wrake, dat smeult in mijn hert. Het
zal wezen het zweerd, het vuur, de koorde, de brand, de verwoesting,
de oorlog en de val van de beulen!
--Gij zijt schoon, zegde zij treurig, hem op beide wangen kussend;
maar zwijg toch.
--Waarom weent gij? vroeg hij.
--Gij moet altijd zien waar gij zijt, sprak zij, hier en ook elders.
--Hebben de muren dan ooren? vroeg Uilenspiegel.
--Zij hebben alleen de mijne, sprak zij.
--Met een kus zal ik ze geerne sluiten.
--Gekke vriend, luister toch als ik spreek.
--Waarom? wat hebt gij te zeggen?
--Luister, sprak zij met ongeduld. Daar is mijne moeder.... Zwijg,
zwijg vooral in heur bijzijn....
De oude Sapermillemente kwam binnen. Uilenspiegel bezag heur en sprak
in zich zelven:
--Gezicht als eene schuimspaan, oogen met harden en valschen blik, mond
die wil lachen en slechts grijnzen kan, gij maakt mij nieuwsgierig.
--God zij met u, heer, standvastig met u, sprak de oude. Ik heb geld
ontvangen, meisje, schoon geld van den grave van Egmond, als ik hem
zijn opperste kleed bracht, op hetwelk ik den narrenstok geborduurd
heb. Ja, heer, een narrenstok, tegen den Rooden Hond.
--Kardinaal Granvelle? vroeg Uilenspiegel.
--Ja, sprak zij, tegen den Rooden Hond. Men zegt, dat hij den koning
hunne praktijken overbrieft; zij willen hem van kant maken. Zij hebben
gelijk, niet waar, heer?
Uilenspiegel antwoordde niet.
--Hebt gij ze niet gezien in de straten, gekleed met hun wambuis en
hun grijs opperste kleed, gelijk het gemeen draagt, met hunne lange,
hangende mouwen, met kalbasfleschjes en nopjes om den hals? Op al
de opperste kleederen staat de narrenstok geborduurd. Ik heb er wel
zeven en twintig gemaakt en mijne dochter voor 't minst vijftien. Als
de Roode Hond die narrenstokken ziet, is hij grammoedig.
Vervolgens zeide zij stille tot Uilenspiegel:
--Ik weet, dat de heeren besloten hebben den narrenstok te vervangen
door eene korenschoof, tot teeken van eendracht. Ja, ja, zij gaan
strijden tegen den koning en tegen de inquisitie. Zij hebben gelijk,
niet waar, heer?
Uilenspiegel antwoordde niet.
--De vreemde heer is droefgeestig, zei de oude; hij houdt den bek toe.
Uilenspiegel zeide geen woord en ging buiten.
Hij trok een taveerne binnen om het drinken niet te verleeren. De
taveerne was vol drinkers, die zich onvoorzichtig uitlieten over den
koning, de gehate plakkaten, de inquisitie en den Rooden Hond, dien
men het land moest uitjagen. Daar zag hij de oude, in lompen gehuld,
die gebaarde te slapen naast een kapperken brandewijn. Aldus bleef
ze langen tijd zitten; eindelijk trok zij een schaaltje uit den zak;
hij zag heur bedelen in de groepen, en vooral vragen aan degenen,
die zich 't onvoorzichtigst hadden uitgelaten.
En een iegenlijk gaf heur gereedelijk een gulden, een denier of
een oortje.
In de hoop van het meisje te weten wat de oude Sapermillemente hem
verborg, ging Uilenspiegel opnieuw voorbij de woning; het meideken
riep nu niet meer, doch lachte hem, knipoogend, liefelijk toe.
Doch de oude kwam plotseling achter hem binnen.
Grammoedig heur te zien, liep Uilenspiegel als een hert de straat op,
al roepend "'t brandt! 't brandt!" totdat hij kwam vóór het huis van
Jacob Pietersen, den bakker. De ondergaande zonne weerkaatste gloeiend
rood in de vensteren van zijnen winkel, en een dikke rook van brandende
takkebossen steeg op uit den schoorsteen. Uilenspiegel liep voort,
al roepend: "'t brandt! 't brandt!" En met den vinger wees hij naar
't huis van Pietersen. De menigte schoolde samen, zag den rooden
gloed en den dikken rook, en riep lijk Uilenspiegel: 't brandt! 't
brandt! De waker der Katelijnekerk blies op zijne trompet, terwijl
de koster uit al zijne macht de wacharmklok luidde. En de knapen en
meidekens kwamen, zingend en fluitend, met hoopen toegesneld.
Daar de klok altoos luidde en de trompet altoos schalde, toog de oude
Sapermillemente er eindelijk ook henen.
Uilenspiegel hield ze van verre in 't oog. Toen zij weg was, ging
hij binnen.
--Gij, hier! sprak het meideken, brandt het dan niet?
--Neen, neen, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Maar die klok, die zoo jammerlijk klept?
--Zij weet niet wat zij doet, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--En de trompet, en dat volk dat zoo loopt?
--Ons Heer moet zijn getal hebben.
--Waar brandt het dan toch? vroeg zij.
--In mijn hert, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
En hij vloog naar heuren mond.
--Gij bijt mij, sprak zij.
--Ik eet geerne kersen, zegde hij.
Droef glimlachend keek zij hem aan. En schreiend sprak zij tot hem:
--Zet geen voet meer hier in huis. Gij zijt een geus, een vijand des
Pausen, zet hier geen voet meer.
--Uwe moeder? sprak hij.
--Ja, zegde zij blozend. Weet gij waar ze nu is? Daar waar het brandt,
om te luisteren wat er gezegd wordt. En fluks gaat zij bij den Rooden
Hond, hem alles overdragen en het beulswerk voorbereiden. Vlucht,
Uilenspiegel, ik red u, vlucht. Nog een kus, doch kom nooit meer terug;
nog één, gij zijt schoon, maar vertrek!
--Braaf meideken, sprak Uilenspiegel, heur in de armen drukkend.
--Dat was ik niet altijd, zegde zij. Ik deed lijk zij.
Hoe sprak hij, dat liedeken, die zoete oproep tot de verliefde mannen?
--Ja, zegde zij. Moeder wilde het, u red ik, omdat ik u uit
liefde beminne. De anderen zal ik redden te uwer gedenkenis, mijn
geliefde. Zal uw hert nog denken aan het boetveerdige meideken,
als gij verre van hier zijt? Geef mij een kus. Voor geld zal zij
geene slachtofferen naar de galge meer sturen. Ga heen; neen, blijf
nog. Hoe zacht is uwe hand! Zie, ik kus uwe hand, tot teeken van
onderdanigheid; gij zijt mijn heer, mijn meester. Luister, dichtbij,
en zwijg. Dezen nacht zijn rabauwen en diepers en ander slecht volk,
waaronder een Italiaan, de een na den ander hier geweest in ons
huis. Moeder deed ze in deze kamer komen, stak mij buiten, en sloot de
deur achter mij. Ik hoorde echter deze woorden: "Steenen kruisbeeld,
Borgerhoutsche poort, ommegang, Antwerpen, Lieve-Vrouwekerk", een
onderdrukt gelach en guldens, die op tafel geteld werden.... Vlucht,
daar komt ze; vlucht, mijn welbeminde. Denk soms aan mij; vlucht....
Uilenspiegel liep zooals zij zeide tot in den Ouden Haan, en daar
vond hij Lamme weemoedig zitten met eene worst in de hand en zijn
zevende pint Peeterman vóór zich op de tafel.
En, in weerwil van zijn dikken buik, deed hij hem loopen als hij.
IX.
Terwijl hij aldus, gevolgd door Lamme, het op een drafje zette, vond
hij in de Eikstraat een kwaadwillig paskwil tegen Brederode. Hij ging
het hem onmiddellijk overhandigen.
--Ik ben, Heere, sprak hij, die goede Vlaming en die spion van den
koning, dien gij zoo goed bij de ooren trokt en zulken goeden wijn te
drinken gaaft. Ik breng u een lieftallig schriftje, in hetwelk men u
onder anderen beschuldigt, den titel van grave van Holland te nemen,
die den koning behoort. Het is versch geprent door Jan Lastermans,
wonende op de Schavuitenkaai, omtrent de Eerrooversgang.
Glimlachend antwoordde Brederode:
--Ik laat u twee uren lang geeselen, als ge mij den echten naam van
den schrijver niet zegt.
--Heer, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, gij moogt mij twee jaar lang doen
geeselen als gij wilt, maar wat mijn mond niet weet, zult gij mijnen
rug niet doen zeggen.
En hij ging henen met een gulden voor zijne moeite.
X.
Sedert de Zomermaand, de maand van rozen, was men in Vlaanderen aan
't preeken.
En de apostelen der eerste kerstene Kerk preekten overal, op alle
plaatsen, in 't groen en in de hovingen, op de heuvelen waar men
bij overstrooming de beesten in veiligheid bracht, op de rivieren,
in booten.
Te land verschansten zij zich als in een kamp, door middel van
karren. Op de rivieren en in de reeden hielden schuiten vol gewapende
mannen de wacht rondom hen.
En rond de verschansingen stonden boogschutters en pijkeniers, om
hen te behoeden voor eene verrassing des vijands.
En aldus weerklonk allerwegen het woord der vrijheid op den bodem
der vaderen.
XI.
Uilenspiegel en Lamme waren te Brugge, en ze lieten hunne kar in een
beluik, om Sint-Salvatorskerk binnen te gaan; zij waren liever naar
de taveerne gegaan, doch hunne tassche liet geen blijd gerinkel van
geld meer hooren.
Pater Cornelis Adriaensen, minderbroeder, een vuile, woedende,
blaffende en schaamtelooze prediker, speelde dien dag zijne perten
in den kansel der waarheid.
Jong en poezele kwezelkens verdrongen zich rond hem.
Pater Cornelis sprak over de Passie. Gekomen ter plaatse van de Heilige
Schrift, waar de Joden, naar Jezus wijzend, tot Pilatus schreeuwden:
"Aan het kruis, aan het kruis met hem, want wij hebben eene wet en,
volgens die wet, moet hij sterven!" riep broeder Cornelis uit:
"Gij hoort het, goede lieden, als Ons-Heer Jezus Christus een
gruwelijken en schandelijken dood is gestorven, is het omdat er tegen
de ketters altijd wetten bestonden. Hij werd te recht veroordeeld,
omdat hij de wet had geschonden. En nu willen ze de edicten en
plakkaten als nietig aanzien. Ha! Jezus, welke vermaledijding wilt gij
over deze landen doen vallen! Allerheiligste Moeder Gods, was keizer
Karel nog in leven en kon hij het schandaal zien van die verbonden
edelen, die zoo stoutmoedig waren de landvoogdes een vertoogschrift
aan te bieden tegen de inquisitie en tegen de plakkaten, die met het
beste inzicht gemaakt, na zoo langdurige en voorzichtige overwegingen
opgesteld en uitgevaardigd zijn tot uitroeiing van alle sekten en
ketterijen! En nu ze dat meer van noode zijn dan brood en dan kaas,
willen zij ze vernielen! In welken smerigen, stinkenden, afgrond
wil men ons lokken? Luther, die razende os, zegepraalt in Saksen, in
Brunswijk, in Luneburg, in Mecklenburg; Brentius, de vuile Brentius,
die in Duitschland van eikelen leefde die de verkens versmaadden,
Brentius zegepraalt in Wurtenberg; Servet, de waanzinnige Servet, die
een kwartier van de maan in zijn hoofd heeft, zegepraalt in Pommeren,
in Denemarken en in Zweden, en daar vermeet hij zich de heilige,
glorierijke en almachtige Drievuldigheid te lasteren. Ja. Maar
men heeft mij gezegd, dat hij levend verbrand werd door Calvijn,
die eindelijk dan toch iets gedaan heeft dat deugt; ja, door den
stinkenden Calvijn, die zuur riekt; ja, met zijnen snuit zoo lang als
die van eenen otter; met zijnen kaaskop, met zijn groote tanden, die
op de tanden eener egge gelijken. Ja, die wolven verslinden elkander;
ja, die os van een Luther, de razende os, wapende de prinsen van
Duitschland tegen den wederdooper Munzer, die een snul was, naar men
zegt, en leefde volgens de Heilige Schrift. En heel Duitschland door,
hoorde men 't geloei van dien os, ja, heel Duitschland door!
"Ja, en wat ziet men in Vlaanderen, in Gelderland, in Friesland, in
Holland, in Zeeland? Adamieten, die naakt door de straten loopen, ja,
goede lieden, naakt door de straten, en schaamteloos hun mager lichaam
aan de menschen toonen. Er was er maar één, zult ge zeggen;--ja,
't kan zijn--maar één is honderd, en honderd zijn één. En werd hij
verbrand, vraagt ge? hij werd levend verbrand op het aanzoek van
Calvinisten en Lutheranen. Die wolven verslinden elkander, zeg ik u!
"Ja, wat ziet men in Vlaanderen, in Gelderland, in Friesland, in
Holland, in Zeeland? Wederdoopers, vrijheidsapostelen, die leeren dat
alle dienstbaarheid strijdig is met het woord Gods. Zij liegen, die
stinkende ketteren; wij moeten ons onderwerpen aan onze Heilige Moeder,
de Roomsche Kerke. En daar, in die verdoemde stad Antwerpen, waar
al het kettergespuis van de wereld bijeenkomt, dorsten zij preeken,
dat wij onze hostiën met hondenvet bakken! Een ander durft zeggen:
't is die geus, die op dien waterpot zit, op den hoek van de straat:
"Er is geen God, geen eeuwig leven, geene verrijzenis des vleesches,
geen eeuwige verdoemenis". "Men mag, zegt die andere ginder,
men mag doopen zonder zout, zonder vet, zonder speeksel, zonder
duivelbezwering en zonder keerse". "Er is geen vagevier", zegt een
ander. Geen vagevier, goede lieden! Zaliger voor u goede lieden,
ware het van te zondigen met uwe moeder, uwe zuster, uwe dochter,
dan een oogenblik te twijfelen aan 't bestaan van het vagevier!
"Ja, en zij lachten met den inquisiteur, den heiligen man, ja. Ze
zijn hieromtrent, te Bellem, geweest met vier duizend Calvinisten,
gewapende mannen, met trommels en vaandels. Ja. En van hier riekt gij
den stank hunner keuken. Zij hebben Sinte-Katelijnekerk genomen om
ze te onteeren, te ontwijden, te ontheiligen met hunne vermaledijde
predikatiën.
"Is die verdraagzaamheid niet goddeloos en niet schandalig? Bij
de duizenden duivelen uit de helle, waarom steekt gij ook de
handen niet uit naar de wapenen, weekhertige katholieken? Als dat
calvinistengebroed, hebt gij ook harnassen, lansen, hellebaarden,
zweerden, kruismessen, alsmede de falkonetten, bussen, slangen en
serpenten van de gemeente.
"Zij zijn vreedzaam, zult gij zeggen; zij willen, in volle rust en
vrede, Gods woord aanhooren. 't Is eender. Trekt de stad uit! verjaagt
mij, doodt mij, smijt mij al die Calvinisten uit den Tempel! Zijt
gij nog niet weg! Foei, gij zijt precies lijk verschrikte hennen,
die op eenen mesthoop staan te beven! Ik zie het oogenblik aankomen,
op hetwelk die verdoemde Calvinisten op den buik uwer vrouwen en
dochteren zullen trommelen en gij zult ze laten begaan, weekelingen
van mannen die gij zijt. Gaat niet naar Bellem, blijft hier, gij zoudt
uwe kousen verslijten. Foei, Bruggelingen! foei, katholieken! Schande
over u, eenden, ganzen en kalkoenen die gij zijt!
"Dat moeten schoone predikantjes zijn, daar gij met hoopen luisteren
gaat naar de leugenen, die zij uitbraken en daar de meidekens des
nachts naar hunne sermoenen trekken, zoodat de stad binnen negen
maanden vol kleine geuskens en geuzinnekens zal steken? Zij waren
daar gevieren, vier truwanten, die preekten op 't kerkhof. De eerste
bleek en mager, die leelijke broeksch..., had een vuilen hoed op zijn
hoofd, met denwelken hij zijne ooren verborg. Heeft iemand van u ooit
de ooren van eenen predikant gezien? Hij had geen hemd aan, want zijne
armen staken bloot uit zijn wambuis. Gij kondt door zijn broek kijken,
als door den St.-Jacobstoren van Antwerpen. De andere schelm had
geen schoenen aan zijne voeten. Niemand heeft zijne ooren gezien. En
hij bleef steken in zijne predikanterij, en de knapen en meidekens
jouwden hem uiten riepen: "Ahoe! ahoe! hij kent zijne les niet." De
derde had een vuilen, leelijken hoed op, met een pluimken op zij. Ook
zijne ooren kon men niet zien. De vierde, een beetje beter gekleed
dan de anderen, moet door den beul tweemaal gebrandmerkt zijn, ja!
"Onder hunnen hoed dragen zij allen vettige, zijden hoofddeksels,
die hunne ooren verbergen. Hebt gij ooit de ooren van een predikant
gezien? Ooren! ha! ja, hunne ooren toonen; de beul is er mee weg:
zij zijn allen gekortoord!
"En nochtans is 't rond die schelmen, rond die diepers, rond
die schoenlappers die hunnen spanriem ontliepen, rond die luizige
predikanten, dat die van 't gemeen riepen: "Leve de geus!" alsof zij
allen razend, zat of zot waren.
"Ha! ons, arme Roomsch-Katholieken, blijft anders niets over dan de
Nederlanden te verlaten, vermits men er den kreet: "Leve de geus! Leve
de geus!" laat uitbraken! Welke steen van vermaledijding is dan toch op
dat stompzinnig, betooverd volk gevallen? Ha! Jezus! overal zijn rijken
en armen, edelen en onedelen, ouden en jongen, mannen en vrouwen aan
't roepen: "Leve de geus!"
"En wat zijn al die heeren, al die kaalkoppen, die ons uit Duitschland
overgewaaid zijn? Heel hunne have hebben zij in ontucht opgegeten
met de wijven, met den drank, met het spel. Zij hebben zelfs geen
verroesten nagel meer om te krabben daar waar het jeukt. En nu eischen
zij het goed van kerken en kloosters!
"En daar, in hun gastmaal, bij dien truwant van Kuilenburg, met
dien anderen drinkebroer Brederode, hebben zij uit houten napjes
gedronken, uit minachting voor den heere van Berlaymont en mevrouwe de
landvoogdes. Ja, en zij hebben geroepen: "Leve de geus!" Ha! ware ik
in de plaats van den goeden God geweest, ik hadde hun drinken, bier
of wijn, veranderd in vuil, walgelijk schotelwater, ja, in vuile,
stinkende loog, waarin zij hunne vuile hemden en drekkige lakens
hadden kunnen wasschen.
"Ja, tiert, ezels die gij zijt, brult: "Leve de geus!" Ja, tiert maar
op, doch ik ben profeet. En al de verwenschingen, rampen, koortsen,
pesten, branden, verwoestingen, kankers, Engelsche zweetkoortsen en
zwarte pesten zullen over de Nederlanden vallen. Ja, en aldus zal God
gewroken worden over uw vuil getier van "Leve de geus!" En er blijft
geen steen uwer huizen over of geen splinter van uw verdoemde beenen,
die zoo haastig naar die vervloekte Calvinisterij en predikanterij
liepen. Het zij zoo! Amen!
--Laat ons gaan, sprak Uilenspiegel tot Lamme.
--Dadelijk, sprak Lamme.
En hij zocht onder de jonge en schoone kwezelkens, die naar het
sermoen geluisterd hadden; maar zijne vrouw vond hij niet.
XII.
Uilenspiegel en Lamme kwamen aan het Minnewater, hetwelk de groote
doctoren en wijsneuzige wijsgeeren halsstarrig doen afstammen van
Minrewater of Minderbroederswater.
Zij bleven op den oever staan en zij zagen vrouwen, meidekens en
knapen, arm in arm, met bloemen getooid, die malkander teederlijk in
de oogen bezagen en dicht tegen elkander gedrongen gingen.
Als Uilenspiegel hen zag, dacht hij aan Nele. En bij die weemoedige
herinnering, sprak hij treurig tot Lamme:
--Lamme, laat ons iets drinken.
Maar Lamme hoorde niet wat Uilenspiegel zegde; droefgeestig bezag
hij de verliefde paartjes.
--Weleer gingen wij ook aldus, arm in arm, mijne vrouw en ik, tot
groote afgunst van hen, die in alleenigheid, zonder geliefde levend,
nijdig ons nakeken.
--Kom, sprak Uilenspiegel, de Zeven vinden wij misschien op den bodem
eener pinte.
--Dat is drinkebroerspraat, antwoordde Lamme; de Zeven, dat weet gij
wel, zijn reuzen, die onder 't groot gewelf van Sint-Salvatorskerk
niet kunnen recht staan.
Uilenspiegel dacht treurig aan Nele. Ook dacht hij, dat hij misschien
in eene of andere afspanning een goed maal, een goed onderkomen en
een lieftallige bazinne zou vinden; hij sprak nogmaals:
--Laat ons iets drinken!
Maar Lamme luisterde niet en sprak, naar Onze-Lieve-Vrouwetoren
kijkend:
--Heilige Maria, patronesse der geoorloofde minne, verleen mij de
gunst, heur blanken boesem weder te zien,
--Kom mede, sprak Uilenspiegel, heur blanke boezem troont in de eene
of andere taveerne.
--Hoe durft gij dat zeggen? sprak Lamme.
--Wel zeker, sprak Uilenspiegel, ze moet ergens weerdinne zijn.
--Dronkemansuitvluchten, sprak Lamme.
Uilenspiegel vervolgde:
--Wellicht bewaart zij voor de arme zwervers een schotel gestoofd
ossevleesch, niet te vet, niet te droog, malsch lijk rozeblaadjes,
zwemmend tusschen menigvuldige kruidnagelen, notemuskaat,
hanekammetjes, kalfszwezerikken en andere hemelsche lekkernijen.
--Deugniet! sprak Lamme, gij wilt mij zeker doen sterven. Weet gij dan
niet, dat wij sedert twee dagen van droog brood en klein bier leven?
--Dat is praat van een gulzigaard, antwoordde Uilenspiegel. Gij
schreeuwt van honger; kom eten en drinken. Ik heb een halven gulden
en zal de kosten van 't gelag betalen.
Lamme lachte. Zij gingen hunne kar halen en, aldus door de stad
rijdend, zochten zij naar de beste afspanning. Doch zij trokken er
vele voorbij, als zij de zure gezichten van den baas of de bazinne
zagen, weinig aantrekkelijk uithangsbord voor een gezellige keuken.
Zij kwamen op de Zaterdagsmarkt en gingen het gasthof, de Blauwe
Lanteern binnen. Daar zag de weerd er vriendelijker uit.
Zij deden uitspannen en den ezel op stal zetten, in gezelschap van
een maatje haver. Zij lieten zich een keurig avondmaal opdienen,
aten hunne bekomst, sliepen als dassen en stonden 's morgens op,
om nog te eten. Lamme schitterde van genoegen en sprak:
--In mijne maag hoor ik een hemelsche muziek.
Als 't oogenblik van betalen gekomen was, ging de weerd bij Lamme en
sprak hij:
--'t Is tien oortjes.
--Hij heeft ze, zei Lamme, naar Uilenspiegel wijzend, die antwoordde:
--Ik heb ze niet.
--En de halve gulden?
--Ik heb er geen, sprak Uilenspiegel.
--'t Is gemakkelijk gezegd, sprak de baas; dan zal ik u uw wambuis
en hemd uittrekken.
Lamme, dien de drank moedig maakte, stond recht en riep uit:
--En als ik wil eten en drinken, ja, eten en drinken voor zeven en
twintig gulden en nog meer, zal ik het doen! Of meent gij, dat er
geen rooden duit in dezen buik steekt? Bij God! tot hiertoe werd hij
uitsluitend met ortolanen gevoed. Dergelijken buik zult gij nooit onder
uw vettigen gordelriem dragen. Bij mij ligt het vet drie duim dik op
den buik, terwijl gij het op den kraag van uw wambuis moet zoeken.
De weerd was buiten zich zelven van woede. Hakkelaar van nature,
wilde hij rap spreken; doch hoe meer hij zich haastte, hoe meer hij
moest niezen als een hond, die uit 't water komt. Middelerwijl wipte
Uilenspiegel bollekens brood naar zijn aangezicht. En Lamme, meer en
meer opgewonden, vervolgde:
--Ja, ik bezit genoeg voor uw drie magere hennen, uw vier schurftige
kiekens en dien grooten dwazerik van een pauw, die met zijn morsigen
steert het neerhof ginds ronddwijlt. En als uwe huid niet verrimpeld
was als die van een ouden haan, als uw beenderen niet vaneen vielen in
uwe borstkas, dan had ik nog genoeg om u ook op te eten, u, en uwen
snotterigen knecht, en uw halfblinde meid, en uwen kok, die gelukkig
mag zijn als hij 't schurft niet heeft, daar zijne armen te kort zijn
om zich ordentelijk te krabben.
--Bezie mij, vervolgde hij, bezie mij dien vogel eens, die, voor een
halven gulden, ons wambuis en ons hemde wil uitdoen! Daarom moet men
schaamtevrij zijn; heel zijne plunje is geen drie duiten weerd.
Maar de baas blies door zijnen neus van woede.
En Uilenspiegel wipte maar altoos bollekens brood naar zijn aangezicht.
Lamme, dapper als een leeuw, vervolgde:
--Hoeveel, magere tronie, hoeveel meent gij wel wat een ezel weerd
is, een ezel met een fijnen mond, met lange ooren, een breede borst,
met spieren als ijzer zoo sterk? Achttien gulden voor 't minst, is
't niet, armoedige baas? Hoeveel verroeste nagelen hebt gij wel,
om zulk schoon beest te betalen?
De baas blies nog meer door zijnen neus, doch dorst zich niet roeren.
Lamme sprak:
--Hoeveel meent gij, dat een schoone esschen kar geldt, die heel in
't blauw is geverfd en tegen zon en regen bespannen met eene huif
van Kortrijksch lijnwaad? Vier en twintig gulden voor 't minst,
niet waar? Vier en twintig gulden en achttien gulden, hoeveel maakt
dat? Antwoord, armzalige rekenmeester. En, daar het marktdag is en er
boeren in uwe ellendige afspanning zijn, ga ik ze dadelijk verkoopen.
Hetgene geschiedde, want allen kende Lamme. En inderdaad, voor ezel
en kar kreeg hij vier en veertig gulden en tien oortjes. Toen deed
hij het goud rinkelen onder den neus van den weerd, en sprak hij:
--Hewel, baas is hier geld genoeg om nog iets te peuzelen?
--Ja, sprak de baas.
En stille zegde hij:
--Als gij ooit uw vel verkoopt, geef ik er een oortje voor: 't zal
een amulet tegen overdadigheid wezen.
Doch een hupsch en lieftallig wijfje, dat in het donker binnenhof
stond, was verscheidene reizen voor 't venster naar Lamme komen zien,
en telkens dat hij heur schoon gezichtje kon bemerken, trok ze zich
schielijk achteruit.
's Avonds, als hij, zonder licht, waggelend de trap opklom, voelde
hij eene vrouw, die hem omarmde, hem kuste op zijne kaken, zijnen
mond, tot zelfs op zijn neus; zijn gezicht was nat van hare tranen,
na hetwelk zij hem liet voortgaan.
Lamme ging naar zijn bedde en sliep als een os, en 's anderen daags
trok hij met Uilenspiegel naar Gent.
XIII.
Daar zocht hij zijne vrouw in al de kaberdoeskens, danszalen en
taveernen. 's Avonds vond hij Uilenspiegel terug in den Zingenden
Zwaan. Uilenspiegel ging overal rond om het volk tot opstand te wekken,
tegen de beulen van den vaderlandschen bodem.
Op de Vrijdagsmarkt, omtrent de Dulle Griet, ging Uilenspiegel plat
op zijn buik ten gronde liggen.
Een kooldrager kwam voorbij en sprak:
--Wat doet gij daar?
--Ik maak mijnen neus nat om te zien van waar de wind komt, antwoordde
Uilenspiegel.
Een timmerman kwam.
--Neemt gij den grond voor een bedde? vroeg hij.
--Er zijn er, die hem weldra voor een deken zullen nemen antwoordde
Uilenspiegel.
Een monnik bleef staan.
--Wat doet dat kalf daar? vroeg hij.
--Het kalf vraagt plat op zijn buik uwen zegen, mijn vader, antwoordde
Uilenspiegel.
De monnik gaf hem dien en toog henen.
Toen legde Uilenspiegel zijn oor tegen den grond; een boer kwam
voorbij.
--Hoort gij daar iets? vroeg hij.
--Ja, sprak Uilenspiegel, ik hoor het hout groeien, hetwelk zal dienen
om de arme ketteren te verbranden.
--Hoort gij niets anders? vroeg een stadsserjant.
--Ik hoor, sprak Uilenspiegel, de Spaansche soldaten aandraven; als
gij iets hebt, dat dierbaar is, begraaf het dan, want weldra zijn de
steden niet meer veilig tegen de roovers.
--Hij is zot, zei de serjant.
--Hij is zot, herhaalden de poorters.
XIV.
Doch Lamme at of dronk niet meer, dacht standvastig aan den zoeten
droom op de trap in de Blauwe Lanteern. Zijn hert trok hem naar Brugge,
maar Uilenspiegel nam hem mede naar Antwerpen, alwaar hij jammerend
voort zocht.
Uilenspiegel ging in de taveernen en, sprekende over de plakkaten,
zeide hij tot goede Vlamingen, tot hervormden, ja zelfs tot
vrijheidminnende katholieken:
--Zij brengen ons de inquisitie mede, zoogezegd om ons lijf van
de ketterije te zuiveren, maar 't is ook voor onze beurze, dat die
rabarber zal dienen. Wij, die niets innemen tegen onze goesting, wij
zullen ons verzetten, muitmaken en de hand aan de wapenen slaan. Dat
weet de koning. Als hij ziet, dat wij zijne rabarber niet willen, zal
hij afkomen met lavementpijpen: dat zijn groote en kleine kanonnen,
falkonetten, slangen met wijden mond. Een koninklijk lavement,
kortom. En in het derwijze gepurgeerde Vlaanderenland zal geen begoede
burger meer overblijven. Gelukkige landen, die zulk een koninklijken
geneesheer hebben!
Maar de poorters lachten.
Uilenspiegel sprak: Lacht maar; doch vlucht of wapent u op den dag,
als er in Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk beelden worden gebroken.
XV.
Op 15 der Oogstmaand, den grooten dag van Maria en van de wijding
van kruiden en wortelen, wanneer de hennen, volgepropt met graan,
doof blijven voor 't geroep van den haan, werd aan eene der poorten
van Antwerpen, een groot steenen kruisbeeld aan stukken geslagen
door een Italiaan, in dienst van Granvelle. 's Zondags nadien ging
de ommegang van Onze-Lieve Vrouwekerk uit, voorafgegaan door groene,
gele en roode narren.
Maar het Mariabeeld werd onderwege gehoond door rapaille, dat riep:
"Maaiken, de uitdraagster, dit is uw laatste feestdag, want men zal
haast met u mosselen zieden"; het beeld werd ijlings in 't koor van
de kerk teruggebracht.
Uilenspiegel en Lamme gingen Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk binnen. Havelooze,
in lompen gehulde jongelieden en ook eenige volwassenen, elkeen
onbekend, stonden vóór het koor tot malkander zekere teekenen
en gebaren te maken. Zij maakten veel gerucht met voeten en
tongen. Niemand had ze ooit in Antwerpen gezien, of zag ze later
ooit weer. Een hunner, met een bruin gezicht als een verbrande ajuin,
vroeg of Maaiken--dat was Maria--bang was, daar ze zoo ijlings terug
in de kerk kwam.
--'t Is toch niet voor u dat ze bang is, leelijke moor, antwoordde
Uilenspiegel.
De jonge schoelje, tot wien hij sprak, kwam op hem af om hem te slaan,
maar Uilenspiegel nam hem bij den kraag en sprak:
--Als gij durft slaan, doe ik u uwe tong uitspuwen.
Zich vervolgens tot eenige Antwerpsche vrienden wendend, die daar
waren, zeide hij:
--Signoorkens en pagadders (naar de havelooze kerels wijzend),
betrouwt ze niet, 't zijn valsche Vlamingen, lafaards en verraders,
die betaald zijn om ons in kwaad, in ellende en in rampspoed te lokken.
Vervolgens tot het geboefte sprekend, zeide hij:
--Hewel, ezelskoppen, die uittdroogt van armoe, vanwaar haalt gij het
geld, dat thans in uwe beurze rinkelt? Hebt gij soms nu reeds uw vel
verkocht om er trommelen van te maken?
--Beziet eens dien preeker! riepen ze.
Toen begonnen zij allen samen te schelden, sprekende van
Onze-Lieve-Vrouwe:
--Maaiken heeft een schoon kleed! Maaiken heeft een schoone kroon! Ik
zal ze geven aan eene loddege van mijne kennis.
Zij gingen buiten, terwijl een onverlaat den predikstoel beklom om
er zotte reden te houden, en zij kwamen terug, roepende:
--Kom beneden, Maaiken, of wij komen u halen. Doe een mirakel, toon
nu eens dat gij kunt loopen, in stee van u laten dragen!
Maar Uilenspiegel riep te vergeefs: Rampzaligen, houdt op met uw
geschimp; alle plundering is misdaad! Zij gingen voort met hunne
heiligschendende taal en spraken zelfs van het koor binnen te breken
en Maaiken beneden te halen.
Daarop smeet een oude vrouw, die keersen verkocht in de kerk, hun de
assche van haren vuurpot in het gezicht; maar zij werd geslagen en
ten gronde gestampt, en daarna herbegon het geweld.
De markgraaf kwam in de kerk met zijne hellebaardiers. Toen hij het
volk samengeschoold zag, spoorde hij het aan de kerk te verlaten,
maar zoo weinig krachtdadig, dat slechts enkelen henen gingen; de
anderen spraken:
--Eerst moeten de kanunniken de vespers zingen, ter eere van Maaiken.
De markgraaf sprak:
--Er wordt niet gezongen.
--Dan zullen we zelven zingen was het antwoord.
Zoo deden zij in de zijbeuken en omtrent het portaal van de
kerk. Eenigen speelden met den bal en hinkelden met steentjes over
den vloer en zeiden: "Maaiken, nimmer speelt gij in het hemelrijk,
en gij verveelt u: kom spelen met ons".
En onophoudelijk hoonden zij het beeld, riepen, huilden en floten.
De markgraaf gebaarde bang te zijn en ging henen. Hij deed de deuren
sluiten behalve ééne.
En hoewel het gemeen er zich niet mee bemoeide, werden de galgenazen
stoutmoediger en riepen zij nog luider. Het gewelf weergalmde als onder
't gebulder van kanonnen.
Op den predikstoel klom er toen een. Hij scheen gezag te hebben;
met een gebaar deed hij allen zwijgen, en hij begon te preeken:
"In den naam des Vaders, des Zoons en des Heiligen Geestes,
drie zijn één en één is drie; God beware ons in 't hemelrijk van
dergelijke cijferkunde; op heden, vijftienden van de Oogstmaand, is
Maaiken met heur schoonste kleeren in triomf uitgegaan om haar houten
gezicht te toonen aan alle signoorkens en pagadders van de goede stad
Antwerpen. Maar onderwege in den ommegang, is Maaiken den duivel Satan
tegengekomen en Satan sprak lachend tot haar: "Zijt gij nu te fier
om den armen pagadder Satan goeden dag te zeggen, omdat gij gekleed
zijt als eene koningin, en gij gedragen wordt door vier signoren?" En
Maaiken antwoordde: "Gaat van hier, Satan, of ik verbrijzel u nogmaals
den kop!" "Maaiken, dat doet gij nu reeds vijftienhonderd jaar, maar
de Geest van den Heer uwen meester heeft mij verlost. Ik ben sterker
dan gij; gij zult mij op den kop niet meer trappen, en nu ga ik u een
dansken leeren. Satan nam een duchtige lederen zweep en begon er mee
te kletsen op Maaiken, die niet dorst schreeuwen om niet te laten
zien dat ze bang was; en toen is ze op den loop gegaan en deed zij
de signoorkens die haar droegen insgelijks loopen, opdat ze met heur
gouden kroon en rijke juweelen niet onder 't arme gemeene volk zou
vallen. En nu zit Maaiken koes en bevend in heur kot, te kijken naar
Satan, die daar omhoog op gindsche zuil zit, met de zweep in de hand,
en grijnslachend zegt: "Ik zal u het bloed en de tranen betaald zetten,
die vloeiden in uwen naam! Maaiken, hoe is 't met uwe onbevlektheid? Ge
moet rijden! We gaan u aan stukken slaan, leelijk houten beeld dat
ge zijt, voor al de beelden van vleesch en beenderen, die in uwen
naam genadeloos verbrand, gehangen en levend begraven werden." Aldus
sprak Satan, en hij had gelijk. En gij moet beneden, wreedaardig,
bloeddorstig Maaiken, want gij geleekt geenszins op uwen zoon Christus.
En heel de menigte handlangers riep en tierde en huilde:
"Maaiken! Maaiken, gij moet rijden! Maakt gij nu uw hemd nat van
schrik? Weg met de houten heiligen! Laat heur een bad in de Schelde
nemen! Hout drijft toch boven!"
Het volk aanhoorde hen zonder iets te zeggen.
Doch Uilenspiegel klom op den predikstoel, stampte met geweld den
spreker van de trappen en zei tot het volk:
--Dwazen, onnoozele dwazen, ziet gij dan niet verder dan uw neus lang
is? Begrijpt gij dan niet, dat dit alles verraderswerk is? Zij willen
u tot heiligschenners en tot beeldbrekers maken, om u tot muiters te
kunnen verklaren, uwe kisten te ledigen, u te onthalzen en levend
te verbranden! En de koning zal erven! Signoorkens en pagadders,
hecht geen geloof aan de woorden dier bewerkers van rampspoed: laat
Onze-Lieve-Vrouw in heure nis, leeft kloekmoedig, werkt blijgezind en
geniet van uwe winsten en profijten. De zwarte duivel des rampspoeds
heeft u in 't oog, en 't is door plundering en vernieling, dat hij het
vijandelijke leger zal roepen om u als rebellen te behandelen en Alva
over u te doen regeeren door dictatuur, inquisitie, verbeurdverklaring
en dood!
... En hij zal erven!
--Laas, sprak Lamme, plundert niet, signoorkens en pagadders; de
koning is al kwaad genoeg. De dochter van de borduurster heeft het
tot mijn vriend Uilenspiegel gezegd. Plundert niet, mijne heeren!
Maar het gemeen kon hen niet hooren.
De handlangers riepen:
--Ze moet beneden! In de Schelde, de houten heiligen. Hout drijft
toch boven!
Uilenspiegel klampte zich aan den preekstoel vast en riep tevergeefs:
--Signoorkens en pagadders, duldt de plundering niet! Brengt uwe stad
niet ten onder!
En hij werd weggerukt met gekwetst gelaat, wambuis en hoos gescheurd,
hoewel hij zich dapper verweerde met vuisten en voeten. En heel
bebloed, hield hij niet op te roepen:
--Duldt de plundering niet!
Maar het was te vergeefs.
De onbekenden en het grauw van de stad liepen tegen het hek van het
koor aan, hetwelk zij braken al roepend:
--Vive le geus!
Allen begonnen te breken, te plunderen, te vernielen. Vóór middernacht
was die groote kerk, in dewelke zeventig autaren, allerhande schoone
schilderijen en kostbaarheden waren, teenemaal ledig. De autaren
werden aan stukken geslagen, de beelden werden van hunne pedestalen
getrokken, uit hunne nissen gerukt, op den vloer geworpen en met
hamers verbrijzeld en de gewijde olie tot schoensmeer gebezigd. Toen
er niets meer te breken viel, trok de bende naar de Minderbroeders,
De Franciscanen, Sint-Pieters, Sint-Andries, Sint-Jacobs, Sint-Joris,
Sint-Michiels, de Peterpotkerk, den Burcht, het Fawkensklooster,
de Witte Zusters, de Grijze Zusters, de Predikheeren en al de
kerken en kapellen van de stad, om er te werk te gaan als in
Onze-Lieve-Vrouwe. Zij namen waskeersen en flambouwen en liepen er
mee overal rond.
En onder hen was geen getwist nog krakeel; geen hunner werd gekwetst
in die groote afbraak van steen, van hout en andere stoffen.
Zij trokken naar den-Haag, om er de beelden en autaren weg te nemen;
doch daar noch elders verleenden de protestanten hun hulp.
In den-Haag vroeg de magistraat hun, waar hunne lastgeving was.
--Hier, sprak een hunner, en hij sloeg op zijn hert.
--Hoort gij, signoorkens en pagadders? Hunne lastgeving! sprak
Uilenspiegel, die het feit vernomen had. Er is dus iemand, die hun
last geeft het werk van heiligschenners te doen! Als een dief mijne
hut binnendringt, zal ik doen als de magistraat van den-Haag, en
zal ik, mijn hoedeken afnemend, vragen: Lieve schelm, beminnelijke
dieper, eerbiedweerdige roover, waar is uwe lastgeving? Hij zal
wijzen naar zijn hert, dat dorst naar mijne have. En ik zal hem al
mijne sleutels ter hand stellen! Zoekt, zoekt wien de plundering
baat. Mistrouwt den Rooden Hond; de misdaad is begaan, de beteugeling
zal volgen. Mistrouwt den Rooden Hond! Het groote steenen kruisbeeld
is aan stukken geslagen. Mistrouwt den Rooden Hond!
Toen Uilenspiegel vernam dat de Groote Raad van Mechelen, door den
mond van zijnen voorzitter Viglius, geboden had den beeldenstorm
geenerlei verzet te bieden, sprak hij:
--Laas! de oogst is rijp voor de Spaansche maaiers. De hertog! de
hertog nadert! Vlamingen, de zee, de zee der wrake wast. Arme
vrouwen en meidekens, vlucht den put. Arme mannen, vlucht de galg,
het vuur en het zweerd! Philippus wil het bloedig werk van keizer
Karel voltooien. De vader zaaide dood en ballingschap; de zoon heeft
gezworen, dat hij liever over een kerkhof dan over een kettervolk
heerscht. Vlucht, daar zijn de beul en de grafmakers.
Het volk luisterde naar Uilenspiegel, en honderden gezinnen verlieten
de steden, en de wegen waren vervuld met karren vol huisraad van
allen die in ballingschap gingen.
En Uilenspiegel ging overal, gevolgd door Lamme, die jammerend zocht
naar zijne vrouw.
En te Damme weende Nele bij de uitzinnige Katelijne.
XVI.
Toen Uilenspiegel, in de Wijnmaand, te Gent was, kwam hij Egmond
tegen, die gegastreerd had in het edel gezelschap van den abt
van Sint-Baafs. Neurend, dede hij droomerig zijn peerd op stap
gaan. Eensklaps keek hij op, en zag hij eenen man, die met een
brandende lanteerne naast hem ging.
--Wat wilt ge? vroeg Egmond.
--Uw welzijn, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, zooveel welzijn, als een
brandende lanteerne kan geven.
--Ga heen en laat mij, sprak de graaf.
--Ik zal niet gaan, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Moet gij dan van de zweep hebben?
--Ik wil er wel tienmaal van hebben, als ik in uw hoofd zulk eene
lanteerne kan steken, dat gij klaar ziet tot in 't Escuriaal.
--Ik heb zaken met uwe lanteerne noch met 't Escuriaal, antwoordde
de graaf.
--Wel, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, ik kan mij niet weerhouden u een
goeden raad te geven.
Hij greep het peerd des graven bij den teugel en, terwijl het sloeg
en steigerde, sprak hij:
--Heere, gedenk toch, dat gij thans goed op uw peerd danst en dat
uw hoofd ook goed op uwe schouderen danst; maar de koning wil, naar
men zegt, dien schoonen dans afbreken, u uw lijf laten, maar uw hoofd
nemen om het zoo verre van hier te doen dansen, dat gij het nimmermeer
krijgen kunt. Geef mij een gulden, ik heb hem verdiend.
--Van de zweep, als gij niet wegkomt, ongeluksvogel.
--Heer, ik ben Uilenspiegel, zoon van Klaas, die levend verbrand werd
voor het geloof, en van Soetkin, die stierf van verdriet. De assche
die klopt op mijne borst, zegt mij, dat Egmond, de dappere krijgsman,
met de landwacht, die hij aanvoert, tegen den hertog van Alva zijne
driemaal zegevierende troepen kan stellen.
--Ga heen, antwoordde Egmond, ik ben geen verrader.
--Red onze landen, gij alleen vermoogt het, sprak Uilenspiegel.
De graaf wilde hem slaan met zijne zweep, doch Uilenspiegel bleef op
de slagen niet wachten, wegvluchtend riep hij nog:
--Eet lanteernen, eet lanteernen, heer graaf. Red onze landen!
Op een anderen dag hield Egmond stil voor de afspanning het Bont
Verken, gehouden door een lieftallige bazinne van Kortrijk, het
Muizeken geheeten.
De graaf stond recht op zijne stijgbeugels en riep:
--Is er iemand?
Uilenspiegel, die bij 't Muizeken diende, kwam vóór met een tinnen
beker in eene hand en in de andere eene bottel vol rooden wijn.
De graaf herkende hem:
--Ha, gij zijt het, ongeluksvogel, sprak hij.
--Heere, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, kunt gij mij zeggen wat het roodst
is, óf de wijn die door de keel vloeit, óf het bloed dat uit den hals
stroomt? Dat was het wat mijne lanteerne vroeg.
De graaf antwoordde niet, dronk, betaalde en vertrok.
XVII.
Uilenspiegel en Lamme, elk gezeten op een ezel, dien zij kregen van
Simon Simonsen, een der getrouwen van den prins van Oranje, reden
overal rond om de poorters te verwittigen van de snoode inzichten
van den bloedigen koning en om tijdingen uit Spanje te vernemen.
Zij verkochten groenten, waren gekleed als boeren en liepen de
markten af.
Bij het terugkeeren van de markt van Brussel, zagen zij in een steenen
huis, op de Kareelkaai, in een lage kamer, eene dame gekleed in samijt,
hoog van kleur, vol van boezem en schalksch van oog.
Zij sprak tot een jonge en poezele keukenmeid:
--Gij zult een goede klont boter in de pan moeten smelten, want ik
houd niet van saus met ijzersmaak.
Uilenspiegel stak zijn neus voor het venster.
--Ik wel, sprak hij, want een hongerige maag kan veel verdragen.
De dame keerde zich om en sprak:
Wat is dat voor een moeial, die zich met mijne keuken bemoeit?
--Eilaas! schoone dame, sprak Uilenspiegel, liet ge mij er een weinig
mede bemoeien in uwe gezelschap, ik leerde u gerechten uit vreemde
streken maken, die onze dames niet kennen.
En smakkende, zei hij:
--Ik heb dorst.
--Naar wat? vroeg zij.
--Naar u, sprak hij.
--Hij is schoon, zei de keukenprinses tot de dame. Willen wij hem
binnenlaten, hij zal ons zijne avonturen vertellen.
--Maar zij zijn getweeën.
--Ik gelast mij met éénen, hernam de keukenmeid.
--Mevrouwe, sprak Uilenspiegel, 't is waar, we zijn getweeën: ik en
mijn arme Lamme, die geen honderd pond op den rug kan dragen, doch
gemakkelijk met vijfhonderd pond eten en drinken op de maag loopt.
--Jongen, zei Lamme, spot niet met mij; 't is al ongelukkig genoeg,
dat mijn buik mij zoo duur kost.
--Vandaag kost hij u geen duit, sprak de dame. Komt beiden binnen.
--Maar, sprak Lamme, er zijn ook twee ezelen, waarop wij zitten.
--In den stal van den grave van Meghem is geene haver te kort,
antwoordde de dame.
De keukenmeid liet heure braadpannen staan en bracht Uilenspiegel en
Lamme op het binnenhof, en de ezels begonnen seffens te balken.
--Ze rieken eten en ze schateren uit van vreugde, de arme dieren,
sprak Uilenspiegel.
Toen beiden van hunne ezels waren gestegen, sprak Uilenspiegel tot
de keukenmeid:
--Zoudt gij een ezel lijk ik willen, als gij een ezelinnetje waart?
--Ik zou een jongen met een vroolijk gezicht willen, als ik eene
vrouw was, antwoordde zij.
--Wat zijt gij dan, als gij vrouw noch ezelin zijt? vroeg Lamme.
--Eene maagd, sprak zij, eene maagd is geene vrouw, en eene ezelin
evenmin: begrijpt gij, dikzak?
Uilenspiegel sprak tot Lamme:
--Gij moet heur niet gelooven, 't is een deugnietje en een
duivelinneken. Beëlzebub heeft ze van nu af aan verkoren tot zijne
gezellin in de helle.
--Leelijke spotter, antwoordde de keukenmeid.
De dame sprak:
--Drinkt eerst eene pint bruinbier, eet een stuk hesp, snijdt van
dien bout, opent de pastei en proeft de salade.
Uilenspiegel vouwde de handen te zamen.
--Hesp, sprak hij, is heerlijk eten; bruinbier, hemelsche drank,
hamelbout, goddelijk vleesch; een gevulde pastei doet de tong van
genoegen trillen; een geurige salade is een vorstelijke spijs. Doch
zalig is hij, die uwe schoonheid tot nagerecht krijgt.
--Hoor hem eens bezig. Toe, eet, ondeugende jongen!
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Zou ik niet liever beginnen met de dankzegging?
--Neen, sprak zij.
Maar Lamme was jammerlijk aan 't zuchten:
--Ik heb honger.
--Gij zult eten, sprak de schoone dame, vermits gij over niets anders
bekommert zijt dan over uwen buik.
--Ha! en mijne vrouw, zuchtte Lamme, als om heur gezegde te
logenstraffen.
Maar die woorden stelden de meid teleur. Lamme en Uilenspiegel aten
buik-sta-bij en dronken als tempeliers. En de dame gaf dien nacht
nog te eten aan Uilenspiegel en ook 's anderen daags en volgende dagen.
De ezels kregen een dobbel maatje haver en Lamme dobbel rantsoen. Eene
week lang bleef hij in de keuken geplakt en sloeg hij menigerhande
schotels naar binnen, maar hij hield zich niet bezig met de meid,
want hij dacht te veel aan zijne vrouw.
Dat maakte de dienstmeid spijtig, en ze zei, dat het een schande
was den menschen al dien last aan te doen, om uitsluitend aan zijn
vettigen buik te denken.
En intusschen leefden Uilenspiegel en de dame zeer vriendschappelijk
samen. Eens zegde zij tot hem:
Thijl, zoudt gij de verdediging uwer gemartelde broederen op u nemen?
--De assche van Klaas klopt op mijne borst, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Zóó zijt gij schoon, riep zij uit. Maar wie is die Klaas?
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Mijn vader, die voor het geloove verbrand werd.
--De grave van Meghem lijkt geenszins op u, sprak zij; hij wil eene
lating toedienen aan de stad, die ik minne, want ik ben van Antwerpen,
de zeeghaftige stede. Weet dus, dat hij overeengekomen is met Scheyf,
den raadsheer van Brabant, om zijne tien vendels voetvolk in Antwerpen
te brengen.
--Dat zal ik den poorters gaan zeggen, sprak Uilenspiegel; en hij ijlde
weg, rap als de wind. 's Anderen daags waren de poorters te wapen.
Doch Uilenspiegel en Lamme, die hunne ezels op stal gezet hadden
bij eenen pachter van Simon Simonsen, moesten zich schuil houden,
uit vreeze voor den grave van Meghem, die hen overal deed zoeken om
ze te hangen; want hij had vernomen, dat twee heretieken van zijn
vleesch gegeten en van zijnen wijn gedronken hadden.
De grave was jaloersch, en zeide het tot de schoone edelvrouwe,
die knarsetande, weende en wel zeventien reizen in onmacht viel. De
keukenmeid volgde heur voorbeeld, maar zoo dikwijls niet en verzekerde,
op heur aandeel in 't hemelrijk en heurer ziele zaligheid, dat zij en
heure Mevrouw niets anders gedaan hadden dan het afval van 't eetmaal
gegeven aan twee armzalige pelgrims, die op magere ezelen gezeten,
voor het keukenvenster waren komen staan,--en méér niet.
En dien dag vloeiden er zoovele tranen, dat de grond teenemale nat
was. Dit ziende, schonk messire van Meghem geloof aan heure woorden.
Lamme dorst niet meer teruggaan naar het huis van den edelen heere,
want telkens dat de keukenmeid zijn neus zag, begon zij zelve te
zuchten en te jammeren: Ha! mijne vrouw!
En hij was mistroostig, om den wille van het eten; doch Uilenspiegel
bracht hem altoos eenige lekkere kliekjes mede, want hij drong in
het huis langs de Sinte-Katelijnestraat, en hield er zich op den
zolder verscholen.
's Anderen daags, na de vespers, beleed de grave van Meghem aan de
schoone vrouwe, dat hij besloten had vóór den dageraad met zijne
soldaten 's-Hertogenbosch binnen te dringen. Dan viel hij in slaap.
De gravinne liep naar den zolder om Uilenspiegel te vertellen hetgeen
zij wist.
XVIII.
Verkleed als pelgrim, zonder geld, zonder mond behoeften, trok
Uilenspiegel dadelijk naar 's Hertogenbosch, om de poorters te
waarschuwen.
Hij was van zins een peerd te nemen bij Jeroen Praet, broeder van
Simon, voor wien hij brieven van den prins had, om van daar spoorslags,
langs de binnenwegen naar 's Bosch te rijden.
Op den steenweg, hoorde hij eene bende huurlingen achter zich
aanstappen. Hij verschrikte hevig, om reden van de brieven.
Vast besloten allen tegenspoed het hoofd te bieden, bleef hij staan om
Onze-Vaders te mompelen: toen zij hem ingehaald hadden, ging hij mede
met hen, en alzoo vernam hij, dat zij naar 's Hertogenbosch trokken.
Een Waalsch vendel opende den marsch. Aan het hoofd reden kapitein
Lamotte en zijne wacht van zes hellebaardiers; vervolgens, naar
rangorde, de vendrig met eene kleinere wacht, de provoost, zijne
hellebaardiers en zijne twee vangmannen, het hoofd van de wacht,
de trosbewaarder, de beul en zijne knecht; dan volgden pijpen en
tamboerijnen met een oorverdoovend lawijd.
Vervolgens kwam een Vlaamsch vendel van tweehonderd soldaten, met
zijn kapitein, zijn vendrig, en verdeeld in twee afdeelingen van
honderd man, elk aangevoerd door de bent-serjanten, en onderverdeeld
in rotten, geleid door tiendeniers of rotmeesters. De provoost en zijne
stokknechten waren mede voorafgegaan door pijpers en tamboerijnslagers,
die bliezen en roffelden om 't hardst.
Achter hen reden twee wagens, vol schoone, gichelende meidekens,
de lieven der soldaten. Joelend, dartelend en schaterend, etend,
drinkend en dansend, volgden de schoone, dolle meidekens den tros.
Er waren er gekleed als landsknechten, maar in fijn, helderwit
lijnwaad, uitgesneden aan de borst, uitgebekt aan mouwen en beenen,
aan het wambuis, zoodat men heure donzige huid kon zien; op het hoofd
droegen zij fijn lijnwaden kappen, met goud afgelegd, en met schoone
wapperende struisvogelpluimen. Aan heure goudlinnen gordelbanden,
gestikt met rood satijn, hingen de goudlakensche scheeden heurer
dolkmessen. En heure schoenen, kousen en hozen, heure wambuizen en
rijgsnoeren waren van witte zijde en klatermeerse.
Anderen waren insgelijks als landsknechten gekleed, doch in blauwe,
groene, scharlaken, paarse, karmozijnen stoffen, uitgebekt, geborduurd
en met wapenen versierd, naar alle grillen en vindingen. En allen
droegen op den arm een rood schijfje, tot teeken van heur bedrijf.
De hoerwijfel, haar serjant, wilde haar het zwijgen opleggen; maar zij
deden hem lachen door heur grappige woorden en bekoorlijke gebaren,
en naar zijne vermaningen luisterden zij niet.
Uilenspiegel, in zijn pelgrimspij, ging naast de twee vendels,
gelijk een speeljacht, dat vaart naast een oorlogsschip. En hij
knauwde steeds voort Onze-Vaders.
Eensklaps sprak Lamotte tot hem:
--Waar gaat gij aldus, reizende pelgrim?
--Heer kapitein, antwoordde Uilenspiegel die honger had, weleer
bedreef ik een groote zonde, en 't kapittel van Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk
veroordeelde mij, te voet naar Rome vergiffenis te gaan vragen aan
den Heiligen Vader, die ze mij verleende. Nu kom ik gereinigd in deze
landen terug, op voorwaarde onderwege de Heilige Mysteriën te prediken
voor alle soldaten, die ik zou ontmoeten en die mij, in ruil mijner
sermoenen, brood en vleesch moeten geven. En aldus preekend, voorzie
ik in mijn armzalig bestaan. Wilt gij mij de toelating schenken,
bij de eerste pleisterplaats mijn gelofte te houden?
--Ja, sprak messire van Lamotte.
Zich broederlijk mengend onder Walen en Vlamingen, vergat Uilenspiegel
niet, van tijd tot tijd te tasten naar de brieven onder zijn wambuis.
De lustige deernen riepen hem toe:
--Pelgrim, schoone pelgrim, kom hier en laat ons hooren den gloed
uwer rede.
Uilenspiegel naderde heur en zeide vol zedigheid:
--Zusteren in Christus, spot niet met een armen pelgrim, die allerwegen
het heilig geloof voor de soldaten moet preeken.
En met de oogen verslond hij de lieve meidekens.
Maar de lustige wijven staken heure blijde gezichten door de gaten
van het zeil van den wagen.
--Ge zijt wel jong, spraken zij, om voor de soldaten te preeken. Kom
in onze wagens, wij zullen een blijdere taal tot u spreken.
Uilenspiegel had geerne gedaan zooals zij zeiden, maar hij dorst niet,
om reden van de brieven; reeds hadden er twee heure ronde blanke armen
uit den wagen gestoken, om hem op te trekken, maar de hoerwijfel,
die jaloersch was, snauwde tot Uilenspiegel:
--Ga weg of ik kap uw hoofd af!
En Uilenspiegel verwijderde zich van den wagen, dorstige blikken
werpend naar de frissche deernen, die de zonne met licht overstroomde.
Men kwam te Berchem; Philip de Lannoy, heere van Beauvoir, aanvoerder
der Vlamingen, beval daar halt te houden.
Daar stond een eik van middelbare grootte, met een enkelen tak
afgebroken in 't midden en waaraan, eene maand geleden, een wederdooper
had gehangen.
De soldaten bleven staan, en de marketensters kwamen bij hen
om hun brood, vleesch, wijn, bier en allerhande toespijzen te
verkoopen. Aan de lustige wijvekens verkochten zij suikergebak,
krakelingen, amandelen, taartjes. Als Uilenspiegel dat zag, kreeg
hij nog grooteren honger.
Vlug als een aap, klom Uilenspiegel op den boom en zette zich op
den dikken tak, zeven voet boven den grond. Daar sloeg hij zich met
eene geeselkoord, terwijl de soldaten en hunne lieven rond den boom
kwamen staan.
--In den naam des Vaders, des Zoons en des Heiligen Geestes, sprak
hij. Amen! Er staat geschreven: Wie aan den arme geeft, leent aan God:
dappere krijgslieden, en gij ook, schoone damen, leent aan God: 't is
te zeggen, geeft mij brood, vleesch, wijn, bier, als gij wilt, en de
taartjes die gij missen kunt, en God, die rijk is, zal U alles dobbel
teruggeven, met dozijnen ortolanen, beken malvezij, bergen kandijsuiker
en rijstpap, die gij in 't hemelrijk zult eten met zilveren lepels.
Vervolgens jammerend:
--Ziet gij niet door welke wreede smerten ik beproef, vergiffenis
mijner zonden te bekomen? Zoudt gij de bijtende pijn dier geeseling
niet lenigen, die tot bloedens toe mijnen rug kwetst?
--Wat is dat voor een zot? vroegen de soldaten.
--Mijne vrienden, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, zot ben ik niet,
doch boetveerdig en stervend van honger; want terwijl mijn geest
zijne zonden beweent, beweent mijn buik het gebrek aan smakelijke
spijzen. Brave soldaten en gij, schoone meidekens, bij u zie ik vette
hesp, gebraden ganzen, worsten, wijn, bier en taartjes, in grooten
getale. Hebt gij niets over voor den armen pelgrim?
--Ja, ja, riepen de Vlaamsche soldaten, zijne tronie bevalt ons.
En allen wierpen stukken eten naar hem. Op zijn tak gezeten, hield
Uilenspiegel niet op met bidden en spreken.
--De honger, sprak hij, maakt den mensch wederspannig tegen het gebed,
doch een stuk hesp neemt die kwade stemming dadelijk weg.
--Pas op uw hoofd! riep een serjant, terwijl hij een half volle flesch
naar hem wierp.
Uilenspiegel greep de flesch en, met kleine slokjes drinkend,
sprak hij:
--Zoo razende honger schadelijk is voor 't lichaam des menschen, is
er nog iets, dat even nadeelig is: te weten de angst van den armen
pelgrim, die van goedhertige soldaten een klein stukje hesp en een
heele bottel bier kreeg. Want gewoonlijk is de pelgrim sober van aard,
en zoo hij dronk met te weinig eten in de maag, ware hij dadelijk zat.
Terwijl hij sprak, ving hij eene ganzebil.
--In de lucht weidevisch vangen, sprak hij, is iets wondersbaars. Maar
de vangst is verdwenen in mijn keelgat. Wat is er gretiger dan droog
zand? Een onvruchtbare vrouw en een hongerige maag.
Plotseling voelde hij de punt eener hellebaard in zijne bil steken. En
eenen vendrig hoorde hij zeggen:
--Versmaden de pelgrims nu hamelbout?
Uilenspiegel zag op de punt van de hellebaard een groot stuk hamelbout
steken.
Hij nam het en sprak:
Bout voor bout, liever heb ik er zoo een tusschen mijn tanden dan
zoo'n ijzeren tegen mijn maag.
--Uit medelijden trek ik dit stuk hamelbout van uw wapen. Van het
mergbeen zal ik eene pijp maken om uwen lof te bezingen, goedhertige
hellebaardier.
... Nochtans, ging hij voort, terwijl hij het been afknaagde, wat
is een bout, hij moge nog zoo lekker en sappig wezen, zoo den armen
pelgrim geen vriendelijk taartje komt toelachen?
Terwijl hij dus sprak, sloeg hij de hand vóór het gezicht, want twee
taartjes, die uit de vrouwengroep kwamen, vlogen het een op zijn
oog, het andere op zijne kaak. De meidekens schaterden van lachen en
Uilenspiegel sprak:
--Wel bedankt, lieve meidekens, die mij roomkusjes zendt!
Maar de taartjes waren ten gronde gevallen.
Plotseling roffelden de trommels, bliezen de pijpen en zetten de
soldaten zich weder op marsch.
Messire van Beauvoir beval Uilenspiegel van den boom te komen en
nevens de soldaten te stappen. Doch Uilenspiegel had honderd uren
van dáár willen zijn, want uit de woorden van eenige soldaten maakte
hij op, dat hij verdacht voorkwam en dat zij hem wel voor een spion
konden nemen; dan zouden zij hem aftasten, en dit was zeker de galge,
als ze zijne brieven ontdekten.
Hij liet zich dus in eene greppel vallen en riep:
--Medelijden, heeren soldaten, mijn been is gebroken, ik kan niet
meer gaan; laat mij meerijden in den wagen der vrouwen.
Maar hij wist, dat de hoerwijfel het niet zou gedoogen.
Van uit haren wagen riepen de vrouwen:
--Ja, kom, schoone pelgrim, kom bij ons. Wij zullen u minnen, u
streelen, u kussen, en gij zult genezen zijn.
--Ik weet het, sprak hij, vrouwenhanden zijn hemelsche balsem voor
alle wonden.
Maar de jaloersche hoerwijfel sprak tot messire van Lamotte:
--Messire, ik geloof dat die pelgrim den spot bij ons drijft, en
dat zijn been maar alleen gebroken is, om bij de vrouwen mede te
rijden. Beveel, dat men hem op den weg late liggen.
--Zoo zal geschieden, sprak messire van Lamotte.
En men liet Uilenspiegel liggen.
Eenige soldaten, die meenden dat zijn been waarlijk gebroken was,
hadden spijt dat men een christenmensch zoo maar liet liggen, want ze
vonden dat hij een lustige kwant was. Zij gaven hem vleesch en wijn
voor twee dagen. De meidekens hadden hem geerne geholpen, doch wijl zij
niet mochten, smeten zij hem de krakelingen toe, die zij nog hadden.
Als de troep verre was, koos Uilenspiegel het hazenpad. Hij kocht
een peerd en rende vlug als de wind, over wegen en paden, naar
's-Hertogenbosch.
Bij de tijding van de komst der heeren Beauvoir en Lamotte, grepen
die van de stad, ten getale van achthonderd, naar de wapenen; zij
kozen aanvoerders en zonden Uilenspiegel, in kooldrager gekleed,
naar Antwerpen om hulp te vragen aan den machtigen Brederode.
En de soldaten der heeren Lamotte en Beauvoir konden niet binnen in
's-Hertogenbosch, de wakkere stede, die zich dapper verweerde.
XIX.
De volgende maand gaf zekere doctor Agileus twee gulden aan
Uilenspiegel en brieven voor Simon Praet, die hem zou zeggen wat hij
te doen had.
Uilenspiegel kreeg bij Praet eten en slapen. Zijn slaap was goed,
zoo goed als zijn tronie; Praet, daarentegen, was schraal en droevig,
altoos in naargeestige gedachten verslonden. En Uilenspiegel was
verwonderd dat hij, als hij 's nachts bij toeval wakker werd, hoorde
kloppen met een hamer.
En hij mocht nog zoo vroeg opstaan, Simon Praet was altijd vóór hem
op, en droever was zijn gelaat, en somberder zijne blikken, als iemand
die bereid is tot sterven of strijden.
Somtijds, bij een zucht, vouwde Praet de handen biddend te zamen en
scheen hij vol verontweerdiging. Zijne vingeren, alsook zijn hemd en
zijn armen, waren vettig en zwart.
Uilenspiegel wilde weten van waar de hamerslagen, de zwarte armen en
Praet's neerslachtigheid kwamen. Op een avond, dat hij in de taveerne
de Blauwe Gans was gebleven, in gezelschap van Simon, die er zijns
ondanks gegaan was, gebaarde hij zoo dronken te zijn en zoo'n zeer
in het hoofd te hebben, dat hij zich onverwijld te bedde moest leggen.
En Praet bracht hem neerslachtig naar huis.
Uilenspiegel sliep op den zolder, bij de katten; het bed van Simon
was beneden, dicht bij den kelder.
Uilenspiegel die dronkenschap bleef voorwenden, klom waggelend de trap
op, en gebaarde schier te vallen, als hij naar de koord greep. Simon
kwam hem ter hulp als een broeder, met teedere zorgen. Hij hielp hem
in zijn bed; hij had medelijden met hem en bad God, dat Hij hem zijne
dronkenschap zou vergeven. Dan ging hij naar beneden en weldra hoorde
Uilenspiegel hetzelfde geklop, dat hem zoo dikwijls gewekt had.
Zonder gerucht stond hij op en daalde op bloote voeten de smalle
treden af; als hij er twee en zeventig geteld had, stond hij vóór
een kleine deur die op een kier stond, waardoor een licht flikkerde.
Simon drukte vliegende blaadjes met oude letteren uit den tijd van
Laurens Coster, den uitvinder van de edele drukkunst.
--Wat doet gij daar? vroeg Uilenspiegel.
Verschrikt gaf Simon hem tot antwoord:
--Klaag mij aan, zoo gij van den duivel zijt: ik zal sterven; maar
zijt gij van God, dat uw mond het gevang uwer tong zij.
--Ik ben van God, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, en wil u geenerlei
kwaad. Maar wat doet gij daar?
--Ik prent bijbels, antwoordde Simon. Want als ik, om vrouw en kinderen
te spijzen, 's daags de booze en wreede edicten Zijner Majesteit
drukken moet, 's nachts ben ik de zaaier van 't echte woord Gods en
herstel ik het kwaad, dat ik bedrijf in den dag.
--Gij zijt braaf en moedig, sprak Uilenspiegel.
--Ik heb het geloove, antwoordde Simon.
Inderdaad, uit die heilige drukkerij was het, dat de Vlaamsche bijbels
kwamen, die verspreid werden in Brabant, in Vlaanderen, in Holland,
in Zeeland, Utrecht, Noord-Brabant, Overijsel, Gelderland, tot den
dag, waarop Simon veroordeeld werd tot het schavot en aan Christus
en de gerechtigheid zijn leven offerde.
XX.
Eens vroeg Simon aan Uilenspiegel:
--Hebt gij moed, broeder?
--Ik heb er genoeg, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, om eenen Spanjaard te
geeselen totdat de dood er op volge, om eenen moordenaar te dooden,
eenen beul onschadelijk te maken.
--Zoudt gij, vroeg de drukker, geduld genoeg hebben om in eenen
schoorsteen te blijven, ten einde te luisteren wat in eene kamer
gezegd wordt?
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Wijl ik door de gratie Gods stevige lenden en fiksche beenen bezit,
kan ik, als de katten, blijven staan waar ik ben.
--Hebt gij geduld en een goed geheugen? vroeg Simon.
--De assche van Klaas klopt op mijne borst, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Nu, luister, sprak de drukker, neem deze aldus gevouwen speelkaart
en ga naar Dendermonde; daar zult gij tweemaal hard en eenmaal
zachtjes kloppen aan de deur van het huis, waarvan de gevel hierop is
geteekend. Iemand zal opendoen en u vragen of gij de schouwveger zijt;
gij zult antwoorden dat gij mager zijt en de kaart niet verloren
hebt. En gij zult ze hem toonen. Dan, Thijl, moet gij doen wat er
hoeft. Groote rampen zweven over Vlaanderenland. Men zal u eene schouw
toonen, gereedgemaakt en geveegd; daar zullen krammen voor uwe voeten
zijn en, om te zitten, een berd, dat stevig vastgemaakt is. Als hij,
die u binnen liet, u zegt in de schouw te kruipen, zult gij het
doen, en gij zult daar stil wachten. Adellijke heeren zullen daar
bijeenkomen, in de kamer vóór de schouw, waarin gij zijn zult. Het
zijn Willem de Zwijger, de prins van Oranje, de graven van Egmond,
van Hoorne, van Hoogstraten en Lodewijk van Nassau, de dappere broeder
des Zwijgers. Wij, hervormden, willen weten wat die heeren willen en
kunnen voor de redding onzer landen.
Nu, den eersten April, deed Uilenspiegel zooals hem gezegd was. Hij
was tevreden, dat er geen vuur in den heerd brandde en zei tot zich
zelven: hoe minder rook hoe scherper het gehoor.
Weldra werd de deur van de kamer geopend, en een tocht trok door
de schouw. Geduldig verdroeg hij den wind, zeggende: hij zal mijn
aandacht aanwakkeren.
Vervolgens hoorde hij de heeren van Oranje, van Egmond en de
anderen de kamer binnentreden. Zij spraken over hunne vreeze,
over de gramschap des konings en over het slecht beheer van 's
lands zaken en penningen. Een hunner sprak op bitsen, hoogmoedigen,
helderen toon. Het was Egmond. Uilenspiegel herkende hem, lijk hij ook
Hoogstraten herkende aan zijn heesche stem. Hoorne aan zijn harde stem;
graaf Lodewijk van Nassau aan zijn mannelijke, krijgshaftige taal, en
den Zwijger aan de langzame wijze waarop hij zijne woorden uitsprak,
alsof hij elk hunner vooraf wilde wegen.
Graaf van Egmond vroeg waarom men hen een tweede reize bijeenriep,
terwijl zij te Hellegat hadden kunnen beslissen wat er te doen stond.
Hoorne antwoordde:
--De uren loopen snel voorbij, de koning is vertoornd; wij mogen
niet talmen.
Toen sprak de Zwijger:
--De landen verkeeren in gevaar; wij moeten ze verdedigen tegen de
aanvallen van de uitheemsche soldaten.
Egmond antwoordde driftig, dat hij het zonderling vond, dat de koning
een leger meende te moeten zenden, daar alles in vrede was door de
zorgen der heeren en voornamelijk door de zijne.
Maar de Zwijger sprak:
--Philippus heeft in de Nederlanden veertien benden, die zijne bevelen
moeten uitvoeren, waarvan al de soldaten dengene verkleefd zijn,
die hen aanvoerde te Gravelingen en te Saint-Quentin.
--Ik begrijp niet, sprak Egmond.
De prins hervatte:
--Ik wil er niets bijvoegen, maar aan u en de andere vergaderde heeren
zal lezing gegeven worden van zekere brieven, met die van den armen
gevangene Montigny te beginnen.
In zijne brieven, schreef messire van Montigny:
"De koning is uitermate vergramd over hetgeen in de Nederlanden gebeurd
is, en op tijd en stond zal hij de daders der woelingen straffen".
Daarop zei Egmond, dat het koud was en dat men diende een houtvuur
aan te steken. Zoo werd gedaan, terwijl de beide heeren spraken over
de brieven.
Het vuur trok niet, om reden van den al te grooten takkebos in de
schouw, en de kamer was vol rook.
Hoestend las toen de graaf van Hoogstraten de onderschepte brieven,
door den Spaanschen gezant te Parijs, don Francès d'Alava, aan de
landvoogdes geschreven.
--De gezant, sprak hij, schrijft dat al het kwaad, dat den Nederlanden
overkomt, te wijten is aan de heeren van Oranje, van Egmond en van
Hoorne. Gij moet, schreef hij, u van de vriendelijkste zijde aan hen
toonen en hun zeggen dat de koning erkentelijk is voor hunne trouw. Wat
betreft Montigny en Bergen: Zij blijven waar zij behooren te zijn.
--Ha! dacht Uilenspiegel, ik zit nog liever in een rookende schouw
in Vlaanderenland, dan in een goed verlucht gevang in Spanje; want
daar verrijzen schavotten tusschen de vochtige muren.
De gezant van Spanje voegde er bij dat de koning in Madrid gezegd had:
--Door al hetgeen in de Nederlanden voorgevallen is, is ons koninklijk
gezag verminderd, de dienst van God verlaagd, en wij zullen liever
het bezit van al onze andere landen in de weegschaal leggen, dan
dit oproer ongestraft te laten. Wij zijn besloten in eigen persoon
naar de Nederlanden te gaan en de hulp des pausen en des keizers te
vorderen. Het kwaad van heden moet het goede van morgen baren. Wij
zullen de Nederlanden onder onze algeheele gehoorzaamheid brengen en,
naar ons believen, staat, godsdienst en regeering wijzigen.
--Ha! koning Philippus, dacht Uilenspiegel, kon ik u naar mijn believen
wijzigen, zeker zoudt gij, onder mijn Vlaamschen stok, een merkelijke
wijziging ondergaan aan uwe dijen, armen en beenen; ik zou uwen kop
met twee nagelen in het midden van uwen rug vastmaken, opdat gij
aldus de kerkhoven kondt zien, die gij achter u laat, en naar eigen
believen uw liedeken van gewelddadige wijziging zoudt kunnen zingen.
Er werd wijn opgediend. Hoogstraten stond recht en sprak:--Ik drink
op onze landen! Allen deden als hij; toen voegde hij er bij, terwijl
hij zijn ledigen beker nederzette:--De rampspoed is gekomen voor den
Belgischen adel. Wij moeten middelen beramen tot onze verdediging.
Hij wachtte een antwoord en zag naar Egmond, die zweeg.
Maar de Zwijger zei:
--Wij zullen weerstaan, als Egmond, die Frankrijk tweemaal beven deed
te Saint-Quentin en te Gravelingen, die alle gezag over de Vlaamsche
soldaten bezit, ons helpen wil om den Spanjaard te beletten in onze
landen te komen.
Messire van Egmond antwoordde:
--Ik heb een al te eerbiedigen dunk van den koning om te meenen dat
wij ons, als rebellen, tegen hem moeten wapenen. Dat zij, die zijnen
toorn duchten, deze landen verlaten. Ik zal blijven, zonder zijne
hulp kan ik niet leven.
--Philippus zal zich wreedelijk wreken, sprak de Zwijger.
--Ik heb vertrouwen, antwoordde Egmond.
--Ook voor uw hoofd? vroeg Lodewijk van Nassau.
--Mijn hoofd, mijn lijf, mijne toewijding, sprak Egmond, alles is zijn.
--Ik, een getrouw onderdaan, doe als gij, sprak Hoorne.
De Zwijger sprak:
--Men moet voorzien en niet wachten.
Toen antwoordde messire van Egmond met drift:
--Te Geeraardsbergen deed ik twee en twintig hervormden hangen. Als
de preeken ophouden, als de beeldenstormers gestraft worden, zal de
woede des konings zich stillen.
De Zwijger antwoordde:
--IJdele hoop.
--Wapenen wij ons met vertrouwen, sprak Egmond.
--Wapenen wij ons met vertrouwen, sprak Hoorne.
--'t Is met ijzer, en geenszins met vertrouwen, dat wij ons moeten
wapenen, hervatte Hoogstraten.
Daarop deed de Zwijger teeken, dat hij wilde vertrekken.
--Vaarwel, prins zonder land, zegde Egmond.
--Vaarwel, graaf zonder hoofd, antwoordde de Zwijger.
Toen zegde Lodewijk van Nassau:
--De slachter is voor het schaap, en de roem voor den moedigen
strijder, die den grond der vaderen redt.
--Ik mag, noch ik wil, sprak Egmond.
--Het bloed van de slachtoffers valle op het hoofd van den hoveling,
sprak Uilenspiegel.
De heeren verlieten de kamer.
Toen kwam Uilenspiegel uit zijne schuilplaats; hij ging rechtstreeks
bij Praet en vertelde hem wat hij gehoord had.
--Egmond is verrader; God is met den prins, zegde Praet.
De hertog! de hertog te Brussel! Waar zijn de geldkisten, die
vleugelen hebben?
DERDE BOEK.
I.
De Zwijger gaat henen, God leide hem!
De twee graven zijn reeds gevangen; Alva belooft aan den Zwijger
goedertierenheid en vergiffenis, zoo hij vóór hem wil verschijnen.
Op die tijding sprak Uilenspiegel tot Lamme:
--Op aanzoek van Dubois, procureur-generaal, heeft de hertog gedagvaard
binnen driemaal veertien dagen vóór hem te verschijnen: den prins
van Oranje, Lodewijk zijn broeder, Hoogstraten, van den Berg,
Kuilenburg, Brederode en andere vrienden des prinsen, onder belofte
van goede justitie en goedertierenheid. Luister, Lamme: Eens daagde
een Amsterdamsche jood een zijner vijanden uit, op straat te komen;
de uitdager stond op den openbaren weg en de andere was boven aan
een venster.
--Kom beneden, riep de uitdager zijn vijand toe, en ik geef u zulken
slag op uwen kop, dat hij in uwe borstkas zal zinken en gij door uwe
ribben zult kijken, lijk een dief door de traliën van zijnen kerker.
De andere antwoordde:--"Al beloofdet gij mij honderdmaal meer, nog
kwam ik niet beneden". Zoo kunnen Oranje en de anderen antwoorden. En
zoo deden zij ook, en zij weigerden vóór Alva te verschijnen. Egmond
en Hoorne deden niet als zij. En zwakheid bij het vervullen van den
plicht roept het uur van God.
II.
Te dien tijde werden te Brussel, op de Peerdenmarkt de heeren onthalsd,
die zich door verrassing hadden willen meester maken van Amsterdam.
En toen zij, geachttienen, naar de strafplaats gingen en psalmen
zongen, roffelden tamboerijnen den heelen weg langs.
En de Spaansche soldaten, die hen begeleidden met brandende toortsen,
brachten hun overal brandwonden toe. En als zij zich verroerden,
ter oorzake van de pijne, riepen de soldaten:--Hoe, Lutheranen,
doet het u dan zeer, zoo vroegtijdig te worden verbrand?
En hij, die hen verraden had, hiet Diederik Slosse. Hij had hen naar
het nog katholieke Enkhuizen gelokt, om ze den beulsknechten van den
hertog over te leveren.
En zij stierven als helden.
En de koning erfde.
III.
--Hebt gij hem zien voorbijgaan? vroeg Uilenspiegel, in houtkapper
gekleed, tot Lamme, die op dezelfde wijze uitgedost was. Hebt gij
den leelijken hertog gezien, met zijn plat voorhoofd als dat van een
arend, en zijn langen baard, die gelijkt op een eind galgekoord? God
verworge er hem mede! Hebt gij die spinnekop met haar lange harige
pooten gezien, die Satan over onze landen braakte? Kom, Lamme, kom;
laat ons steenen smijten in haar net.
--Laas! sprak Lamme, om levend verbrand te worden!
--Kom naar Groenendaal, mijn beste vriend, kom naar Groenendaal; daar
is een schoon klooster, waar de Hertogelijke Spin den God van vrede
bidt, dat Hij heur werk zou laten volvoeren, dat Hij haar als eene raaf
in rot vleesch late wroeten. Wij zijn in de vasten, maar de hertog
wil zich niet onthouden van bloed. Kom, Lamme, er zijn vijfhonderd
gewapende mannen rond het huis van Ohain; driehonderd man te voet
zijn bij kleine groepen vertrokken en dringen in het Zoniënbosch.
Straks, als Alva aan 't bidden is, grijpen wij hem vast, wij steken
hem in een ijzeren kooi en zenden 't ondier aan den prins.
Doch rillend van angst, antwoordde Lamme:
--Groot gevaar, mijn zoon, groot gevaar! Ik zou u helpen in die
onderneming, als mijne beenen zoo zwak niet waren, en mijn buik niet
zoo opgezwollen van het zuur bier, dat zij drinken in Brussel.
Dit gesprek werd gehouden in een hol, gegraven in een dicht bewassen
plaats van het bosch. Door de bladeren turend, zag Uilenspiegel
eensklaps de gele en roode kleederen van de soldeniers des hertogen,
wier wapenen flikkerden in de zonne en die te voet door het bosch
kwamen.
--Wij zijn verraden, sprak Uilenspiegel.
Als de soldaten uit het gezicht waren, liep hij ijlings naar Ohain. De
soldaten lieten hem ongemerkt door, ter oorzake van zijne kleeding
van houtkapper en den last hout, dien hij op den rug droeg. Daar
wachtten de ruiters; hij verspreidde het nieuws; allen gingen uiteen en
ontsnapten, behalve de heer Bausart d'Armentières, die gevat werd. De
heer Bausart moest het voor de anderen wreedelijk bekoopen.
En 't was een lafhertige verrader uit het regiment van den heer van
Likes, die hen allen had aangeklaagd.
Met een hert, dat klopte van angst, ging Uilenspiegel te Brussel naar
de Peerdenmarkt, den ijselijken folterdood bijwonen.
En de arme Armentières, op het rad gelegd, kreeg zeven en dertig
slagen met een ijzeren staaf op de beenen, de armen, de handen en
voeten, die achter elkander aan stukken werden geslagen, want de
beulen vermaakten zich met hem wreed te doen lijden.
En op de borst kreeg hij den zeven en dertigsten klop, van denwelken
hij stierf.
IV.
Op een zoelen en helderen dag van de Zomermaand werd te Brussel, op
de Groote Markt, vóór het Broodhuis, een schavot opgericht, dat met
zwart laken behangen was en nevens hetwelk twee hooge palen stonden,
met ijzeren pinnen. Op het schavot waren twee zwarte kussens en een
kleine tafel, met een zilveren kruisbeeld.
En op dat schavot werden, met het zweerd, de edele heeren van Egmond
en van Hoorne onthalsd.
En de koning erfde.
En de gezant van koning Frans I, over Egmond sprekend, zeide:
--Ik heb daar het hoofd zien vallen van hem, die Frankrijk tweemaal
deed beven.
En de hoofden der graven werden op de ijzeren pinnen gestoken.
En Uilenspiegel sprak tot Lamme:
--De lijken en het bloed zijn met zwart laken bedekt. Gezegend zij,
die in de zwarte dagen, welke op handen zijn, het hert hoog en het
zweerd recht zullen houden.
V.
In dien tijd bracht de Zwijger een leger bijeen, en deed hij de
Nederlanden langs drie kanten tegelijk aanvallen.
En Uilenspiegel zeide in eene vergadering van Wilde Geuzen van
Marenhout:
--Op advies van die der inquisitie heeft koning Philippus een iegelijk
inwoner der Nederlanden plichtig verklaard aan majesteitsschennis,
zoowel om de ketterije aangehangen, als om haar niet bestreden te
hebben. En uit hoofde dier afschuwelijke misdaden veroordeelt hij
allen, zonder onderscheid van kunne of ouderdom, met uitzondering
van hen, die met name genoemd zijn, tot de straffen voor dergelijke
gruweldaden bepaald; en dit zonder de minste hoop op genade. En de
koning erft. De dood maait in de rijke streek tusschen de Noordzee,
het graafschap Emden, de rivier Amisia, de landen van Westfalen,
van Kleef, van Gulik en van Luik, de bisdommen Keulen en Trier,
het land van Lotharingen en Frankrijk. De dood maait in een land van
driehonderd veertig uren omtrek, binnen tweehonderd ommuurde steden,
in honderd vijftig dorpen die stadsrecht bezitten, in vlekken en
velden. En de koning erft.
Elfduizend beulen zijn niet te veel om dat werk te verrichten,--Alva
heet hen soldaten. En de bodem der vaderen is eene slachtbank geworden,
gevlucht door de kunsten, verlaten door de getrouwen, geschuwd door al
de ambachtslieden, die liever den vreemde gaan verrijken, alwaar men
hun den God van het vrije geweten laat aanbidden. Dood en ondergang
maaien. De koning erft.
De landen hadden hunne privileges bekomen met macht van
geld, gegeven aan behoeftige vorsten; die privileges worden
verbeurdverklaard. Volgens de verdragen, gesloten tusschen de landen
en de vorsten, hadden zij gehoopt te genieten van de rijke vrucht
van hun arbeid. Zij bedriegen zich: de metser bouwt voor den brand;
de ambachtsman werkt voor den dief. De koning erft.
Bloed en tranen! De dood maait op de brandstapels, op de boomen,
die langsheen de groote wegen tot galgen dienen, in de gapende
kuilen, in dewelke de arme meidekens levend worden geworpen, in de
kerkers der gevangenissen, in de kransen van brandende takkebossen,
te midden waarvan de slachtofferen met zacht vuur verbranden, in de
gloeiende stroohutten, waarin de veroordeelden sterven door rook en
door vuur. De koning erft.
Aldus wilde de Paus van Rome.
De steden zijn vol spionnen, die loeren op hun deel van de erfenis
der slachtofferen. Hoe rijker, hoe schuldiger. De koning erft.
Maar de wakkere mannen van den lande zullen zich niet laten kelen
als lammeren. Onder de vluchtelingen, zijn gewapende mannen, die
zich in de bosschen verschuilen. De monniken hadden ze verklikt,
opdat men hun lijf en goed zou ontnemen. 's Nachts en ook 's daags
werpen zij zich dan ook bij benden, als wilde dieren, op de kloosters;
zij nemen er het geld terug, dat aan het arme volk ontroofd werd
onder de gedaante van gouden en zilveren kandeleers, fierters of
reliquieënkastjes, kostbare ciboriën, patenen en heilige vaten. Niet
waar, goede lieden? Zij drinken den wijn, dien de monniken voor zich
zelven bewaarden. De gesmolten of verkochte vaten zullen dienen tot
den heiligen oorlog. Vive le geus!
Zij bestoken, dooden, plunderen de soldaten des Konings en vluchten
vervolgens naar hunne holen. Dag en nacht ziet men in de bosschen
vuren aansteken en uitdooven, en gedurig van plaats veranderen. 't
Is het vuur onzer festijnen. Aan ons de eenden en hazen! Wij
zijn de heeren! De boeren geven ons brood en spek, zooveel als wij
willen. Bezie ze, Lamme. Schuw, armoedig, vastberaden en zonder genade,
zwerven zij door de bosschen met hunne aksten, hellebaarden, zweerden,
kruismessen, pijken, lansen, kruisbogen, bussen, want alle wapens
zijn goed, en onder vendrigs willen zij niet staan. Vive le geus!
En Uilenspiegel zong:
    Slaat op den trommel van dirre dom deijne,
    Slaat op den trommel van dirre dom dom.
    Oorlog om Oorlog! Leve de Geus!
    Rukt den hertog Zijn ingewand uit!
    Klopt met de zweep in Zijn aanzicht!
    Slaat op den trommel, de holle trom,
    Vloek zij den hertog, dood den beul!
    Werpt den honden den bloedhond voor! Leve de Geus!
    Hangt hem bij de tong op, bij den arm op,
    Bij de tong, die het vonnis velt,
    Bij den arm, die 't onderschrijft.
    Slaat op de krijgstrom. Leve de Geus!
    Levend bij lijken van slachtoffers!
    Delft den hertog in een kuil,
    Dat hij, in goren stank,
    Sterve om de pest der dooden!
    Slaat op de krijgstrom. Leve de Geus!
    Aanschouw uit den hoogen, Christus, uw scharen,
    Dapper vóór 't vuur, vóór strik en zweerd,
      Al om Uw woord.
    Redden willen wij 't vaderland.
    Slaat op de krijgstrom. Leve de Geus!
En allen dronken en riepen:
--Leve de Geus!
En Uilenspiegel dronk uit den gouden beker eens monniks en keek met
fierheid naar de krijgshaftige gezichten der Wilde Geuzen.
--Wilde geuzen, sprak hij, gij zijt wolven, leeuwen en
tijgers. Verslindt de honden van den bloedigen koning.
--Leve de Geus! riepen zij, en zij zongen:
    Slaat op den trommel van dirre dom deijne,
    Slaat op den trommel van dire dom dom.
    Oorlog om Oorlog! Leve de Geus!
VI.
Terwijl Uilenspiegel te Ieperen was en soldaten voor het leger
van den Zwijger aanwierf, werd hij gezocht door de serjanten des
hertogen. Dienvolgens bood hij zich aan als koster bij den proost van
St.-Maartens-kerk. Voor gezel had hij een klokluider, Pompilius Numan,
een lafaard die zijn gelijke niet had, en 's nachts zijn schaduw voor
den duivel en zijn hemd voor een spook nam.
De proost was vet als een sleksken, of liever, als een kalkoen,
vetgemest en pas voor het braadspit. Weldra werd Uilenspiegel gewaar,
hoe hij het aan boord legde om zoo vollijvig te wezen. Naarvolgens
hij hoorde zeggen door den klokluider en met eigen oogen zag, was de
proost gewoon te negen uren het noenmaal en te vier uren het avondmaal
te nemen. Hij bleef slapen tot halfnegen; vervolgens, alvorens te eten,
deed hij een ronde in zijne kerk, om te zien of de offerblokken voor
den arme goed gevuld waren.
En hij stak de helft der ontvangst in zijn tassche. Te negen uren
nuttigde hij een kom melk, een halven bout, een reigerspasteitje,
besproeid met vijf bekers Brusselschen wijn. Te tien uren nam hij
eenige pruimen met daarbij wat Orlans-wijn, en bad hij God dat Hij
hem steeds voor gulzigheid zou behoeden. 's Middags knabbelde hij
als tijdverdrijf eenen vleugel en de stuit van een kieken. Een uur
daarna dronk hij, in afwachting van 't avondmaal, een grooten beker
Spaanschen wijn; vervolgens legde hij zich te bed, om zich door een
middagslaapje te verkwikken.
Wakker geworden, at hij een stuksken zalm en dronk hij een
grooten beker Antwerpschen dobbelen knol, om zijn eetlust te
scherpen. Vervolgens ging hij naar de keuken, en daar zette hij zich
neer voor het schoon houtvuur, dat in den heerd flikkerde. Hij zag
het groot stuk kalfsvleesch of het speenverkentje voor de monniken
der abdij braden en bruineeren. Hij had er in gebeten, zoo lekker
scheen het. Maar de eetlust ontbrak hem een weinig. En hij bewonderde
het braadspit, dat van zelf ronddraaide. Het was werk van Pieter van
Steenkiste, den smid, wonende in de kasselrij Kortrijk. De proost
had elk dier braadspitten met vijftien pond parisis betaald.
Vervolgens keerde hij terug naar zijn bed, alwaar hij insluimerde, uit
vermoeienis. Daarna werd hij weder wakker om een weinig verkensgelei
te nemen met een slokje Romagne-wijn van tweehonderd veertig gulden
het stuk. Te drie uren peuzelde hij een vogelken met Madeirasuiker,
besproeid met twee glaasjes Malvezij van zeventien gulden het
pijpje. Te half vier at hij een halven pot confituur, begoten met
mede. Goed wakker, nam hij toen een zijner voeten in de handen en
bleef hij in diepe overweging zitten rusten.
Als de tijd van 't avondmaal dáár was, kwam de pastoor van Sint Jans
hem dikwijls bezoeken op dit genoeglijk uur. Soms wedden zij om 't
meeste visch, gevogelte, wild of vleesch te eten. En die 't eerste
vol was, moest karbonaden betalen, die volgens den toen heerschenden
smaak moesten bereid zijn met drie soorten warmen wijn, vier soorten
specerijen en zeven soorten groenten.
Terwijl zij dus dronken en aten, spraken zij samen over de ketteren,
die men, naar hun eenstemmig gevoelen, niet genoeg uitroeien kon. Ook
was er onder hen nooit eenig krakeel, behalve als zij spraken over
de negen en dertig verschillende wijzen om goede bierpap te maken.
Vervolgens neigden hunne eerbiedige hoofden over hunne heilige buiken,
en zij deden een dutje. Soms half wakker schietend, zeide een hunner
dat het leven toch schoon is en dat de arme sukkelaars, die klagen,
ongelijk hebben.
Bij dien heiligen man werd Uilenspiegel koster. Hij diende zeer goed
de misse, en vulde wel driemaal de wijnkannetjes, tweemaal voor zich
zelven en eenmaal voor den proost. De klokluider Pompilius Numan stak
hem hierbij een handeken toe.
Als Uilenspiegel den klokluider zoo gezond, zoo dik en zoo vet zag,
vroeg hij hem of het in den dienst van den proost was, dat hij al
die gezondheid opgedaan had.
--Ja, mijn zoon, antwoordde Pompilius; maar doe goed de deur toe,
want men zou kunnen luisteren.
Toen zegde hij hem stille in 't oor:
--Gij weet dat onze meester, de proost, van alle wijnen en bieren,
alle vleezen en pluimdieren houdt als de kat van de melk. Zijne
eetwaren sluit hij op in eene schapraai en zijne dranken in eenen
kelder, waarvan de sleutels gedurig in zijne tassche steken. En hij
slaapt er mee.... 's Nachts, als hij slaapt, ga ik de sleutels van
op zijnen buik nemen, en ik leg ze dan weder, doch niet zonder beven;
want als hij het wist, zou hij mij zeker in de olie doen koken.
--Pompilius, sprak Uilenspiegel, al die moeite en schrik zijn onnoodig:
neem de sleutels nog eenmaal; ik zal er van maken hetzelfde model en
de andere zullen wij gerust laten liggen op den buik van den goeden
proost, onzen heer.
--Dat is een goed gedacht, zeide Pompilius.
Uilenspiegel maakte de sleutels; zoodra hij en Pompilius, rond
acht uren des avonds, oordeelden dat de goede proost vast in slaap
was, gingen zij beneden en namen zij hunne gading uit vleezen en
flesschen. Uilenspiegel droeg de flesschen en Pompilius de spijzen,
omdat Pompilius altoos beefde als een riet en dat hespen en bouten
toch niet breken als zij vallen. Verscheidene reizen stalen zij
gevogelte, als het nog rauw was, welke feiten ten laste gelegd werden
van meerdere katten uit de gebuurte, dewelke deze dieften met den
dood moesten bekoopen.
Toen trokken de beide gezellen naar de Ketelstraat, waar de meidekens
van pleizier wonen. Daar kniesden zij niet, doch gaven hunnen lievekens
edelmoedig gerookt ossevleesch en hesp, worst en gevogelte; zij lieten
heur zelfs Orlans- en Romagne-wijn drinken, alsmede Engelsche ale
en smakelijk Oosterbier, dat zij goten in de frissche keel hunner
schoenen. En zij werden ruimschoots met kussen betaald.
Doch op een morgen, na het eten, deed de proost zijne beide dienaars
ontbieden. Hij zag er ontzagwekkend uit en zoog, met een boos gezicht,
aan een mergbeentje uit zijne soep.
Pompilius stond te beven in zijne schoenen, en zijn buik trilde van
schrik. Uilenspiegel hield zich stil en tastte, inwendig lachend,
in zijnen zak naar de sleutels.
De proost sprak tot hem:
--Men eet mijn vleesch op en drinkt mijnen wijn uit: zijt gij het,
mijn zoon?
--Neen, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--En die man, daar, de klokluider, sprak de proost, naar Pompilius
wijzend, heeft hij dan de hand aan die misdaad geleend, dat hij zoo
wit als een doek ziet? Zeker heeft de gestolen wijn hem vergiftigd.
--Laas! messire, sprak Uilenspiegel, gij beschuldigt uwen klokluider
ten onrechte, want zoo hij zoo wit ziet, is het niet omdat hij
uwen wijn heeft gedronken, doch wèl omdat hij er te weinig drinkt;
dáárvan is hij zoo slap, dat zijne ziel weldra bij stroomen zijne
hooze zal uitloopen.
--Er zijn arme lieden op deze wereld, zuchtte de proost, terwijl hij
een grooten slok wijn uit zijn beker dronk. Maar zeg mij, mijn zoon,
gij die arendsoogen hebt, hebt gij de dieven niet gezien?
--Ik zal goed opletten, heer proost, sprak Uilenspiegel.
--God bescherme u beiden, mijne kinderen, sprak de proost, en leeft
op sobere wijze. Want uit de onmatigheid komen hier in dit tranendal
al onze kwalen voort. Gaat in vrede.
En hij gaf hun zijn zegen.
En hij zoog nogmaals aan zijn mergbeen, en hij dronk nog een grooten
slok wijn.
Uilenspiegel en Pompilius gingen henen.
--De leelijke vrek, sprak Uilenspiegel, hij had u nog geen slokje
van zijn wijn laten drinken. Als wij nog stelen, zal 't wèl besteed
zijn. Maar wat hebt gij toch, dat gij zoo beeft?
--Heel mijne hooze is nat, zei Pompilius.
--Dat is gauw droog, kameraad, sprak Uilenspiegel. Maar wees verheugd:
dezen avond zal er flesschenmuziek zijn, bij onze lievekens in de
Ketelstraat. En de drie nachtwachten zullen wij dronken maken, en
snorkend zullen zij de stede bewaken.
Zoo gezegd, zoo gedaan.
Doch, 't was dicht tegen Sint-Maartensdag: de kerk was versierd voor
den heiligdag. Uilenspiegel en Pompilius gingen 's nachts de kerk
binnen en sloten goed de deur. Vervolgens staken zij al de waskeersen
aan; zij namen eene viool en eene doedelzak, en begonnen daarop om
het best te spelen. En de keersen vlamden als zonnen. Maar het was
nog niet alles. Als hun werk verricht was, gingen zij bij den proost,
dien zij, hoewel het al laat was, nog op vonden. Hij knabbelde een
lijster en dronk een glas Rijnwijn. De ruiten der kerk verlicht ziende,
trok hij de oogen wijd open.
--Heer proost, zei Uilenspiegel, wilt gij weten wie uw vleesch opeet
en uwen wijn uitdrinkt?
--En die verlichting? sprak de proost, naar de vensters der kerk
wijzend. Ha! Heere God, laat gij den heiligen Martinus nu toe,
's nachts zonder betalen, de keersen der arme monniken te branden?
--Hij doet nog andere dingen, heer proost, sprak Uilenspiegel. Kom
maar zien.
De proost nam zijnen staf en ging mede. Zij traden de kerk binnen.
Daar zag hij, in 't midden van den grooten beuk, al de heiligen uit
hunne nissen gedaald, in een rondeken staan. De heilige Martinus,
wel een kop grooter dan de anderen, scheen de meester te zijn. En
op den wijsvinger der rechterhand, die zegenend uitgestrekt was,
stak een gebraden kalkoen. De anderen hadden in de hand of in den
mond stukken kieken of gans, worst, hesp, versche visch en gekookte
visch en, onder andere, eenen snoek wel veertien pond zwaar. En elke
sant had eene flesch wijn voor zijne voeten staan.
Als de proost dat zag, kon hij zich van woede niet inhouden; hij zag
rood als een haan, en zijn gelaat was zóó opgezwollen, dat Pompilius
en Uilenspiegel meenden dat hij ging bersten; maar, zonder op hen te
letten, ging hij met gebalde vuist recht op den heiligen Martinus
af, alsof hij hem aanzag voor den dief. Hij rukte hem den kalkoen
van zijnen vinger en sloeg op Martinus als de duivel op Geeraard,
zoodat de arm, de neus, de staf en de mijter aan stukken vlogen.
De anderen kregen mede hun deel en meer dan één liet er bij armen,
handen, mijter, staf, zeis, bijl, rooster, zaag en andere kenteekenen
van weerdigheid of martelaarschap. Vervolgens liep de proost, woedend
en haastig, al de waskeersen uitblazen.
En al wat hij vond aan hesp, worst en gevogelte nam hij mede,
en gebogen onder den last, ging hij zoo treurig en ellendig zijne
slaapkamer binnen, dat hij drie bottels wijn dronk.
Toen Uilenspiegel zeker was dat hij sliep, peuzelden de beide vrienden
de beste brokken op, en legden zij de beentjes vóór de voeten der
heiligen. Vervolgens gingen zij naar de Ketelstraat met al wat de
proost meende gered te hebben en ook met hetgeen nog lag in de kerk.
Den volgenden morgen ging Pompilius de metten luiden, terwijl
Uilenspiegel naar boven trok om zijnen meester te wekken.
Deze vroeg wat hij wilde, en Uilenspiegel verzocht hem, beneden
te komen.
Als de proost in de kerk was, toonde Uilenspiegel het overschot van
de heiligen en van het gevogelte.
--Messire proost, sprak hij, zij hebben het toch opgegeten.
--Ja, antwoordde de proost, zij zijn als dieven in mijne slaapkamer
gedrongen, om te stelen hetgeen ik gered had. Ha! heeren santen,
ik zal mijn beklag aan den Paus doen.
--Ja, sprak Uilenspiegel met een bedenkelijk gezicht, maar de ommegang
gaat overmorgen uit: straks komen de werklieden in de kerk. Vreest
gij niet, verraden te worden als beeldenstormer, als zij al die santen
in stukken en brokken zien liggen?
--Ha! heilige Sint Maarten, sprak de proost, spaar mij van het vuur,
ik wist niet wat ik deed.
Zich naar Uilenspiegel wendend, terwijl de bange Pompilius zich aan
het klokzeel liet hangen, sprak hij:
--Nooit zal men tegen Zondag den heiligen-Martinus kunnen
herstellen. Wat zullen de menschen zeggen en wat staat mij te doen?
--Heere, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, nood breekt wet: wij moeten tot
een onschuldig bedrog onze toevlucht nemen. Wij zullen eenen baard
plakken op 't gezicht van Pompilius, die er eerbiedweerdig uitziet,
daar hij altijd weemoedig is. Wij zullen hem den mijter opzetten, hem
het koorhemd, den pelsmantel en het groote opperste kleed des santen
aandoen; wij zullen hem aanbevelen stil op zijn voetstuk te blijven,
en de geloovigen zullen hem voor den houten Sint-Maarten nemen.
De proost ging tot Pompilius, die meer dood dan levend aan het
klokzeel bengelde.
--Houd op met luiden, sprak hij, en luister. Wilt gij vijftien
dukaten verdienen? Zondag zult gij Sint-Maarten in de processie
verbeelden. Uilenspiegel zal u kleeden en als gij, door de vier
mannen gedragen, een gebaar durft maken of uw mond open doen, laat
ik u levend in de olie koken in den grooten ketel, dien de hangman
rechtover de Hallen gebouwd heeft.
--Heer, ik zeg u duizendmaal dank, sprak Pompilius, maar gij weet
dat ik zeer moeielijk mijn water kan ophouden.
--Gij moet gehoorzamen, hernam de proost.
--Ik zal gehoorzamen, eerweerdige heer, sprak Pompilius met den dood
op het lijf.
VII.
De ommegang ging uit, onder een blijde, heldere zon. Uilenspiegel had
de twaalf heiligen zoo goed mogelijk opgelapt en zij waggelden op
hunne voetstukken tusschen de banieren der gilden; daarachter kwam
het standbeeld van Onze-Lieve-Vrouw, vervolgens de maagdekens, in
't wit, die lofzangen zongen, dan de boogschutters, eindelijk het
dichtst bij den hemel en meer waggelend dan de anderen, Pompilius,
die gebogen ging onder de zware kleederen van den heiligen Martinus.
Uilenspiegel, die zich voorzien had van krabpoeder, had zelf Pompilius
zijn bisschoppelijk kleed helpen aantrekken, zijn handschoenen
aangedaan, zijnen staf in zijne hand gestoken en hem geleerd hoe hij de
handen moest houden om het volk te zegenen. Ook had hij de priesters
helpen kleeden. Den eenen had hij de stool aangedaan, den anderen den
pelsmantel, den diakenen het koorhemd. Hij liep gedurig de kerk rond
om de plooien van een wambuis of een hooze effen te strijken. Hij
bewonderde de scherpe wapenen der gilden en de geduchte bogen der
schutters. En elkeen strooide hij een weinig krabpoeder in den hals,
in den rug, op den pols. Maar de deken en de vier dragers van den
heiligen Martinus kregen het meest. De maagdekens spaarde hij omdat
zij zoo lief waren.
De processie ging uit de kerk, in prachtige orde, met fladderende
banieren en wapperende wimpels. Mannen en vrouwlieden sloegen een
kruis als zij voorbijging. En de zonne was heet.
De deken werd 't eerst het poeder gewaar en krabde een weinig achter
zijn oor. Allen, priesters, boogschutters, dragers, krabden zich aan
den hals, de beenen, de polsen, zonder het nog openlijk te durven;
doch de klokluider, die meer uitstond dan de anderen, ter oorzake van
de brandende zon, dorst zich niet verroeren, uit vreeze van levend in
de olie te worden gekookt. Hij neep zijn neus toe, trok een leelijk
gezicht en beefde op zijn waggelende beenen, want telkens dat de
dragers zich krabden, liep hij gevaar van te vallen.
Maar hij dorst zich niet verroeren, en uit schrik liet hij zijn water
maar loopen; en de dragers zeiden:
--Groote Sint Maarten, gaat het nu regenen?
De priesters zongen een lofzang aan de Heilige Maagd:
    Si de coe ... coe ... lo descenderes
    O Sanc ... ta ... ta ... Ma ... ma ... ria.
Want hunne stemmen beefden wegens de krieuweling die onuitstaanbaar
werd; maar zij krabden zich bedektelijk. Doch de deken en de vier
dragers van Sint-Maarten krabden hun vel vaneen. Pompilius hield zich
stil op zijn arme beenen, die 't meest van al jeukten.
Maar eensklaps bleven al de boogschutters, diakenen, priesters, deken
en dragers staan om zich te krabben. Het poeder beet de voetzolen
van Pompilius vaneen, doch hij dorst zich niet verroeren uit vrees
van te vallen.
En de nieuwsgierigen zeiden, dat de heilige Maarten grammoedig rondkeek
en een dreigend gezicht naar het arme volk zette.
Toen beval de deken, dat de processie zou voortgaan.
Weldra echter maakte de loodzware zon de jeukte van de plechtige
ruggen en buiken onuitstaanbaar.
En toen bleven priesters, boogschutters, diakenen en deken, net als
een bende apen eensklaps staan om zich onbeschaamd overal te krabben
waar het jeukte.
De maagdekens zongen heuren lofzang als engelen en heur frissche
stemmetjes stegen liefelijk ten hemel.
Allen trokken er trouwens van door zooals zij konden: krabbend, redde
de deken 't heilig sacrament; het geloovige volk droeg de fierters
terug in de kerk; de vier dragers van Sint Maarten smeten Pompilius
ruwweg ten gronde. En daar nog dorst de arme klokluider zich niet
krabben noch roeren, doch hij sloot devotelijk de oogen.
Twee jonge knapen wilden hem oprichten, doch daar zij hem te zwaar
vonden, stelden zij hem recht tegen den muur en daar begon Pompilius
bitter te schreien.
Het volk kwam rond hem staan; de vrouwen gingen neusdoeken van fijn,
helder lijnwaad halen, wischten zijn gelaat af om zijne tranen als
reliquieën te bewaren, en zeiden tot hem: "Mijnheer de Sant, wat hebt
gij het warm!"
De klokluider keek hen jammerlijk aan en maakte, zijns ondanks,
wegens de krieuweling, met zijn neus de koddigste gebaren.
Doch daar de tranen over zijne wangen rolden, spraken de vrouwen:
--Groote heilige Maarten, weent gij over de zonden der stede
Ieperen? Niet waar, uwe edele neus verroert zich? Wij hebben nochtans
de raadgevingen gevolgd van Lodewijk Vives, en den armen van Ieperen
zal het aan werk noch aan brood ontbreken. Ho! wat groote tranen! Het
zijn kostbare perelen. Onze redding is hier!
De mannen spraken:
--Wat moeten wij doen, groote heilige Maarten, om uwe droefheid
te stillen?
Maar het volk riep:
--Daar is de koster!
Uilenspiegel kwam bij, greep Pompilius vast en droeg hem op den
schouder weg, gevolgd door eene menigte geloovigen van beide
geslachten.
--Laas! zei de arme klokluider hem stille in 't oor, ik ga bezwijken
van de jeukte.
--Houd u stijf, antwoordde Uilenspiegel; vergeet niet dat gij een
houten heilige zijt.
Hij liep op een draf en legde Pompilius neer voor de voeten van den
proost, die zich tot bloedens toe aan 't krabben was.
--Klokluider, vroeg de proost, hebt gij u gekrabd lijk wij?
--Neen, eerwaarde, antwoordde Pompilius.
--Hebt gij gesproken of u verroerd?
--Neen, eerwaarde, antwoordde Pompilius.
--Hewel, sprak de proost, hier zijn uwe vijftien dukaten. Ga u nu
krabben; gij hebt het verdiend.
VIII.
Toen Uilenspiegel de zaak uitgebracht had, zei het gemeen 's anderen
daags, dat het een ongehoorde spotternij was, hun dien schreeuwer
van een klokluider voor eenen heilige te doen doorgaan en te doen
aanbidden.
En velen werden ketters. En, hunne have meenemend, gingen zij het
leger des prinsen versterken.
Uilenspiegel keerde naar Luik terug.
Onderweg zette hij zich te droomen in een bosch. Den helderen hemel
beziende, sprak hij tot zich zelven:
--De oorlog, altijd de oorlog, opdat de Spaansche vijand het arme
volk vermoorde, onze goederen roove, onze vrouwen en dochteren
verkrachte. Nochtans vlieden ons schoone penningen heen en stroomt
ons bloed bij beken door de straten, zonder het minste voordeel voor
iemand, tenzij voor dien koninklijken schoft, die eene perel van gezag
te meer aan zijne krone wil hechten. Perel, die hij glorierijk waant,
doch die maar eene perel van bloed en van rookwalm is. Ha! kon ik U
perelen naar mijnen zin, vliegen alleen zouden uw gezelschap nog wezen.
Terwijl hij daaraan dacht, zag hij eene bende herten voorbijrennen. Er
waren er groote en oude, die hun gewei met negen takken fier in
de lucht bewogen. Jonge reebokjes, die hunne schildknapen zijn,
trappelden met hen en schenen bereid hun met hunne scherpe horens
ter hulp te komen. Uilenspiegel wist niet waar zij heengingen, maar
hij dacht dat het naar hun leger was.
--Ha! sprak hij, oude herten en lieve reebokjes, fier en blijde gaat
gij in het diepst van het bosch uwe legerstee zoeken; langs geurige
paden vindt gij jeugdige spruitjes te eten; gelukkig zijt gij,
totdat de jager, uw beul, komt. Aldus is het ook gelegen met ons,
oude herten en jonge reebokjes!
En de assche van Klaas klopte op Uilenspiegel's borst.
IX.
In de Herfstmaand, als de muggen niet meer bijten, stak de Zwijger
te Sint-Vijt den Rijn over met zes stukken veldgeschut en vier zware
kanonnen, en met veertienduizend Vlamingen, Walen en Duitschers.
Onder de geel-en-roode vendels van Alva, den bloedigen hertog, stapten
zes en twintigduizend vijfhonderd man, vergezeld van zeventien stukken
veldgeschut en negen zware kanonnen.
Maar de Zwijger kon in dien strijd geenerlei voordeel behalen, want
Alva weigerde gedurig 't gevecht.
En zijn broeder Lodewijk, die reeds vele steden gewonnen en vele booten
op den Rijn gekaapt had, verloor bij Jemmingen, in Friesland, tegen
den zoon des hertogen, zestien kanonnen, vijftien honderd peerden en
twintig vendels, door de schuld der lafhertige huurknechten, die geld
vroegen als er te vechten viel.
En te midden van puin en van bloed en van tranen, zocht Uilenspiegel
te vergeefs de redding van den vaderlandschen bodem.
En, heel de Nederlanden door, werden onschuldige slachtofferen
gehangen, onthalsd, verbrand door de beulen.
En de koning erfde.
X.
Door het Walenland reizend, zag Uilenspiegel, dat de prins daar weinig
hulp te verwachten had, en zoo kwam hij omtrent de stad Bouillon.
Weldra zag hij op den weg bultenaars van de beide geslachten, van allen
leeftijd en allen stand verschijnen. Allen, met groote paternosters
in de hand, baden devotelijk.
En hunne gebeden geleken op het gerikkik van kikvorschen in eenen
vijver, 's avonds, na een warmen dag.
Daar waren moeders met bulten, die gebochelde kinderen op den arm
droegen, terwijl andere kleinen aan heure rokken hingen. Er waren
bultenaars op de heuvelen en bultenaars in de dalen. En overal zag
Uilenspiegel op den helderen hemel hun magere schimmen afsteken.
Hij ging tot een hunner en vroeg:
--Waar trekken zij allen henen, die ongelukkige mannen, vrouwen
en kinderen?
De man antwoordde:
--'t Is de begankenis van St. Remaclus; wij gaan naar het graf van
den heilige, om van hem te verkrijgen wat onze herten verlangen:
ons ontlasten van dat vernederend pak op onzen rug.
Uilenspiegel hernam:
--Zou ik van Sint-Remaclus niet kunnen verkrijgen wat mijn herte
verlangt: onze arme gemeenten ontlasten van den bloedigen hertog,
die als een looden bochel op de Nederlanden drukt?
--Hij is niet gelast, de bochels der boete af te nemen, antwoordde
de pelgrim.
--Neemt hij er andere af? vroeg Uilenspiegel.
--Ja, als de bulten jong zijn. Als het mirakel der genezing
geschiedt, is 't volop kermis in de stad. En elke pelgrim geeft dan
een zilverstuk, soms wel een gouden florijn, aan den gelukzalige,
die door zijne genezing heilig geworden is en alzoo met vrucht voor
de anderen kan bidden.
Uilenspiegel sprak:
--Waarom doet de rijke mijnheer Sint-Remaclus zijne genezingen betalen,
lijk een pillendraaier?
--Goddelooze reiziger, hij zal u straffen voor uwe lastertaal,
antwoordde de pelgrim, terwijl hij woedend zijnen bochel schudde.
--Laas! zuchtte Uilenspiegel.
En hij liet zich nedervallen aan den voet van een boom.
De pelgrim staarde hem aan en zeide:
--De heilige Remaclus treft goed als hij slaat!
Uilenspiegel kromde zijnen rug en zuchtte, terwijl hij er aan voelde:
--Genade, doorluchtige heilige. 't Is de kastijding. Tusschen
mijne schouderen voel ik een geweldige pijn. Laas! ai! Vergiffenis,
mijnheer Sint-Remaclus, Ga voort, pelgrim, en laat mij hier, als een
vadermoorder, in alleenigheid weenen met mijn berouwhebbend herte.
Maar de pelgrim was reeds op de vlucht: hij liep tot op de Markt van
Bouillon, waar al de bultenaars vergaderd waren.
Huiverend van schrik, zeide hij met afgebroken woorden:
--Pelgrim ontmoet ... recht als een keers ... den heilige gelasterd
... bult op den rug....
Als de andere bultenaars dit hoorden, stieten zij blijde kreten en
spraken zij:
--Sint-Remaclus, als gij bulten kunt maken, kunt gij er afnemen
ook. Neem onze bulten weg, mijnheer Sint-Remaclus.
Intusschen was Uilenspiegel opgestaan en voortgegaan. Aan de deur
eener taveerne van de eenzame voorstad, zag hij aan eenen stok twee
verkensblazen hangen, een teeken, dat het daar pensenkermis was.
Uilenspiegel nam eene der twee blazen en raapte de ruggegraat eener
schol op; stak zich, om wat bloed in de verkensblaas te laten loopen,
blies haar op, bond ze toe, na hetwelk hij ze vastmaakte op den rug
met de graat daarboven. Aldus toegetakeld, schuddebollend en waggelend
als een oude bultenaar, ging hij naar de Markt.
De pelgrim, die hem had zien vallen, werd hem dadelijk gewaar en riep:
--Daar is de lasteraar!
En hij wees met den vinger naar hem.
En allen liepen naar hem om den rampzalige te zien.
Uilenspiegel schudde treurig het hoofd.
--Ha! sprak hij, ik verdien genade noch medelijden; doodt mij als
een razenden hond.
En de bultenaars riepen verheugd:
--Eén te meer in onze broederschap!
Uilenspiegel mompelde onhoorbaar tusschen de tanden:
--Ik zal het U wel betaald zetten, booze lieden!
Doch hij scheen alles geduldig te verdragen en sprak:
--Ik eet of ik drink niet meer, totdat de hoogweerdige heilige Remaclus
mij geneest zooals hij mij trof.
Bij het nieuws van 't mirakel, kwam de deken uit de kerk. 't Was
een groote, dikke, plechtstatige kerel. Met den neus in de lucht,
kliefde hij door de baren der bultenaars, als eene bark door de zee.
Men toonde hem Uilenspiegel; hij zegde tot hem:
--Zijt gij het, manneken, die getroffen werd door de roede van den
heiligen Remaclus?
--Ja, heer deken, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, ik ben het inderdaad,
zijn nederige dienaar, die zijn nieuwen bult wil laten genezen,
als het Zijne Heiligheid belieft.
De deken, die giste dat er look in de meersch was, sprak:
--Laat mij dien bult eens betasten.
--Tast maar, genadige deken, sprak Uilenspiegel.
Toen de deken getast had, sprak hij:
--Hij is nieuw en nog nat. Ook hoop ik, dat de groote heilige U
genadig zal wezen. Kom mede.
Uilenspiegel volgde den deken en ging mee in de kerk.
De bultenaars liepen achter hem en schreeuwden:
--Daar is hij, de gedoemde, de lasteraar! Hoeveel weegt uw versche
bult? Ik zou er een zak van maken, om mijne daalders in te steken? Heel
uw leven hebt gij den spot gedreven met ons, omdat gij recht waart;
nu is 't onze beurt! Gezegend zij Sint-Remaclus!
Uilenspiegel antwoordde niet, doch volgde met gebogen hoofde den
deken, die hem leidde in een kleine kapel, waar een marmeren graf was,
gedekt met eene zerk, mede van marmer.
Tusschen het graf en den muur der kapel was eene opening van ruim eene
hand breed. Een menigte gebochelde pelgrims, die elkander volgden,
gingen tusschen den muur en de zerk van het graf, tegen dewelke zij
stilzwijgend hunne bulten wreven. En aldus hoopten zij er van verlost
te worden. En zij, die hunne bulten tegen de plaat wreven, wilden de
plaats niet afstaan aan degenen, die volgden; en er werd gevochten,
doch zonder gerucht, want zij dorsten niet dan heimelijk stompen,
uit vreeze van heiligschennis.
De deken zegde tot Uilenspiegel op de zerk te klimmen, opdat alle
pelgrims hem goed konden zien.
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Dat kan ik alleen niet.
De deken hielp hem, bleef bij hem staan en deed hem
knielen. Uilenspiegel gehoorzaamde en bleef met gebogen hoofde zitten
in die deemoedige houding.
Na een kort inwendig gebed, zeide de eerwaarde geestelijke met
heldere stem:
--Kinderen en broeders in Christus, aan mijne voeten ziet gij den
grootsten zondaar en lasteraar, dien Sint-Remaclus ooit met zijne
woede trof.
En, op zijne borst kloppend, sprak Uilenspiegel:--Confiteor.
--Weleer, vervolgde de deken, was hij recht als de stok eener
hellebaard, en was hij er fier op. Beziet hem nu, hij is gebult en
gebocheld onder de verwensching des hemels.
--Confiteor, neem mijnen bult weg, sprak Uilenspiegel.
--Ja, vervolgde de deken, ja, groote heilige, ja, Sint-Remaclus, die,
sedert uw glorierijken dood, negen en dertig mirakels gedaan hebt,
neem van zijne schouderen het gewicht, dat er op drukt, opdat wij
uwen lof kunnen zingen in de eeuwigheid der eeuwigheden, in soecula
soeculorum! En vrede op de aarde aan de bultenaars, die van goeden
wil zijn.
En de bultenaars herhaalden te gelijk:
--Ja, ja, vrede op aarde aan de bultenaars, die van goeden wil
zijn; weg met de bulten, weg met haat en met nijd, weg met alle
vernedering! Neem onze bulten weg, doorluchtige heilige Remaclus!
De deken gebood Uilenspiegel het graf te verlaten en zijnen bochel
te wrijven tegen den kant van de zerk. Uilenspiegel deed het, steeds
mompelend: Mea culpa, confiteor, neem mijnen bult weg!
En hij wreef zich zoo goed, dat al de omstanders zulks oogenschijnlijk
zagen.
En dezen riepen:
--Ziet naar zijn bult, hij plooit! Ziet gij, hij smelt weg, rechts
neemt hij af,--Neen, hij zal in zijnen buik zakken; bulten vergaan
niet, zij keeren terug in de darmen, uit dewelke zij komen.--Neen,
zij keeren naar de maag, waar zij tachtig dagen lang tot voedsel
verstrekken.--'t Is een geschenk van den heilige aan hen, die door
zijne genade van hunnen last zijn verlost.--Wat geworden de oude
bulten?
Plotseling stieten al de bultenaars een grooten schreeuw uit, want
Uilenspiegel had zijnen bult gebersten, door hard tegen den boord
der zerk te drukken. Het bloed dat er in was, liep er uit, droop van
onder zijn wambuis met groote droppelen op de steenen der kerk. En
rechtspringend en de armen uitstrekkend, riep hij blijde:
--Ik ben er van af!
En al de bultenaars riepen te zamen:
--Gezegende Sint-Remaclus, genadig zijt gij voor hem.--Groote
heilige, neem den mijnen ook weg!--Ik zal u een kalf offeren.--Ik,
zeven schapen.--Ik, de jacht van één jaar.--Ik, zes hespen,--Ik, ik
schenk mijne hut aan de kerk.--Neem onze bulten af, heilige Remaclus!
En zij bekeken Uilenspiegel met eerbied en afgunst. Een der bultenaren
wilde onder Uilenspiegel's wambuis tasten, doch de deken verbood het
hem, zeggende:
--Daar is een wonde, die het licht niet mag zien.
--Ik zal voor ulieden bidden, sprak Uilenspiegel.
--Ja, pelgrim, spraken al de bultenaars ondereen, ja, mijnheer de
rechtgemaakte; wij dreven den spot met u; vergeef het ons, wij wisten
niet wat wij deden. Christus, de Zaligmaker, vergaf aan het kruis,
wilt gij ons ook vergiffenis schenken?
--Ik vergeef u, sprak Uilenspiegel op hooghertigen toon.
--Neem toch, zeiden zij, neem dit oortje, aanvaard dezen gulden,
laat ons u dien gouden angelot schenken, dien daalder aanbieden,
dien karolus in uwen zak steken.
--Laat angelotten en karolussen het daglicht niet zien, zeide
Uilenspiegel zeer stille: de linkerhand mag niet weten wat de
rechterhand geeft.
Dat zeide hij om den wille van den deken, die het geld der bultenaars
met de oogen verslond, zonder te zien of het goud was of zilver.
--Wij zeggen u duizendmaal dank, gezegende, geheiligde oud-bultenaar,
zeiden de pelgrims tot Uilenspiegel.
En hij nam hunne giften met hooghertigheid aan, zooals iemand betaamt
die met de gratie des hemels bedeeld is.
Maar de gierigaards wreven hardnekkig hunne bochels tegen het graf,
zonder iets te zeggen en vooral zonder iets te geven.
Uilenspiegel trok 's avonds naar eene taveerne, waar hij kermis vierde.
Alvorens slapen te gaan, dacht hij er aan dat de deken, zoo niet
alles, dan toch zijn deel van den buit zou eischen. Hij telde zijn
winst en vond meer goud dan zilver, want er waren minstens driehonderd
karolussen. Hij zag een verdroogden laurier in een bloempot staan, trok
de plant bij den kop uit den pot en legde zijn goud onder de aarde. En
al de halve guldens, oortjes, deniers spreidde hij uit op de tafel.
De deken trad de taveerne binnen en kwam boven bij Uilenspiegel.
Toen deze hem zag, vroeg hij:
--Heer deken, wat wilt gij van mij, nieteling?
--Ik wil niets dan uw goed, antwoordde de dienaar des Heeren.
--Laas, zuchtte Uilenspiegel, bediedt gij dát goed, dat daar ligt op
de tafel?
--Ja, mijn zoon, antwoordde de deken.
Vervolgens de hand uitstekend, ruimde hij al het geld van de tafel,
en liet hij het vallen in eenen zak, dien hij daarvoor opzettelijk
meegebracht had.
En hij gaf een gulden aan Uilenspiegel, met een zucht alsof het een
stuk zijner ziel was.
En hij vroeg hem het gerief van het mirakel.
Uilenspiegel toonde hem de graat en de blaas.
De deken nam ze, terwijl Uilenspiegel weeklaagde en hem wat méér
vroeg, daar de weg van Bouillon naar Damme zoo lang was voor een
armen voetganger, dat hij ongetwijfeld van honger zou omkomen.
De deken ging heen en lispte geen woord.
Als Uilenspiegel alleen was, sliep hij in met het oog op de plant,
's Anderen daags, met den dageraad, stak hij zijnen buit op zak en
verliet de stad.
Hij ging recht naar het kamp van den Zwijger, gaf hem het geld en
vertelde den Prins hoe hij er aan geraakt was: dit was het beste
middel om schattingen van den vijand te lichten, meende hij.
En de prins gaf hem tien gulden.
De graat werd in een kristallen doos gevat, en gestoken tusschen de
twee armen van het kruis op het hoogautaar, in de kerk van Bouillon.
En een iegelijk, in die stad, weet dat de bult van den rechtgemaakten
lasteraar steekt in het kruis.
XI.
De Zwijger, die in de omstreken van Luik was, deed, alvorens de Maas
over te steken, marschen en tegenmarschen, om de waakzaamheid des
hertogen te verschalken.
Uilenspiegel nam zijne plichten van soldaat ter herte, hanteerde zeer
behendig zijne bus, en hield steeds de ooren en oogen goed open.
Om dien tijd kwamen in het kamp meerdere Vlaamsche en Brabantsche
edelen, die in goede overeenstemming leefden met de heeren, kolonels
en hopmans van 't gevolg van den Zwijger.
En weldra kwamen in het kamp twee partijen tot stand, die gedurig met
elkander in twist waren. De eenen spraken: De prins is een verrader. De
anderen antwoordden, dat de beschuldigers logen en dat zij hun hunne
leugentaal zouden doen slikken. Het wantrouwen werd langzamerhand
grooter. Zij werden handgemeen bij troepen van zes, acht, twaalf man,
vochten in tweegevecht met alle wapenen, ja zelfs met vuurroeren.
Op het gerucht kwam de prins eens toegeloopen; hij drong tusschen de
beide partijen. Een kogel rukte zijn degen aan zijne zijde weg. Hij
stelde een einde aan 't gevecht en bezocht heel het kamp om zich te
toonen, opdat men niet zeggen zou: "De Zwijger is dood, de oorlog
is gedaan".
's Anderen daags, omtrent middernacht, bij mistig weder, stond
Uilenspiegel gereed een huis te verlaten, waar hij een Vlaamsch
minnelied aan een Waalsch meideken gaan zingen was, toen hij eensklaps
aan de deur van het naburige huis een driemaal herhaald ravengekras
hoorde. Een boer kwam op de zulle. Uilenspiegel hoorde stappen op
den weg.
Twee mannen, die Spaansch spraken, kwamen bij den boer, die hun zeide
in dezelfde tale:
--Wat hebt gij gedaan?
--Goed werk, zeiden zij, leugens verspreid ten voordeele des
konings. Dank zij ons, zeggen de wantrouwende hoofdmannen en
soldaten tot elkander: 't Is uit lage eerzucht, dat de prins den
koning wederstand biedt; aldus hoopt hij gevreesd te worden en, als
onderpand van den vrede, vele steden en heerlijkheden te krijgen;
voor vijfhonderd duizend gulden verlaat hij de dappere heeren, die
strijden voor onze landen. De hertog heeft hem algeheele kwijtschelding
doen aanbieden met belofte en eed, al de hooge legerhoofden weer in
't bezit hunner goederen te stellen, als zij zich onderwerpen aan
den koning. Oranje gaat alleen met hem onderhandelen.
--'s Zwijgers getrouwen antwoordden ons:
--De voorstellen des hertogen zijn een verraderlijke strik,
waarin de prins geenszins zal vallen; hij kent 't lot van Egmond en
Hoorne. Zij weten wel dat kardinaal Granvelle zegde, toen hij te Rome
de aanhouding der graven vernam: Men vangt de twee blieken, maar men
laat den snoek ontsnappen; men heeft niets gevangen, zoolang men den
Zwijger niet heeft.
--De verdeeldheid is dus groot in het kamp? vroeg de boer.
--De verdeeldheid is groot, zeiden zij, en wordt elken dag
grooter. Waar zijn de brieven?
Zij gingen de hut binnen, alwaar zij eene lanteerne aanstaken. Door een
klein venster loerend, zag Uilenspiegel hen twee verzegelde brieven
openen, die lezen met merkbare vreugde, een glas wijn drinken en
eindelijk weggaan, in het Spaansch tot den boer zeggende:
--Kamp verdeeld, Oranje genomen. Daar zal een ferme beker afmogen.
--Die, sprak Uilenspiegel in zich zelven, die mogen in't leven niet
blijven.
In den dikken nevel gingen zij buiten. Uilenspiegel zag den boer hun
eene lanteerne brengen.
Het licht der lanteerne werd somtijds verduisterd door een zwarte
gedaante. Uilenspiegel leidde daaruit af, dat zij achter elkander
gingen.
Hij laadde zijn vuurroer en schoot naar de zwarte gedaante. Toen zag
hij de lanteerne verscheidene reizen op en neer gaan; hij maakte eruit
op, dat een van beiden gevallen was en de andere wilde weten waar hij
gewond was. Hij wapende zijn vuurroer opnieuw. Als hij de lanteerne
vlug en slingerend in de richting des kamps zag voortgaan, schoot
hij opnieuw. De lanteerne waggelde, viel ten gronde en doofde uit.
Uilenspiegel liep naar het kamp, maar hij kwam den provoost tegen met
een menigte soldaten, die de vuurschoten hadden gewekt en hij zei hun:
--Ik ben de jager, het wild ligt ginder, gaat het maar oprapen.
--Lustige Vlaming, sprak de provoost, wat beteekenen uwe woorden?
--Woorden zijn wind, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, doch lood blijft in
het lijf der verraders. Maar volgt mij.
En, met hunne lanteernen, bracht hij hen ter plaatse waar de twee
mannen gevallen waren. Werkelijk zagen zij hen ten gronde liggen:
de eene was dood, de andere reutelde: in zijn hand hield hij eenen
brief, dien hij in een laatste stuiptrekking verfrommeld had.
Zij droegen de verslagenen mede, die zij aan de kleederen voor edelen
herkenden, en kwamen aldus met hunne lanteernen bij den prins, die
beraadslaagde met Frederik van Hollenhausen, met den markgraaf van
Hessen en met andere heeren.
Gevolgd door landsknechten, ridders met gele en groene wambuizen,
kwamen zij vóór de tent van den Zwijger, luide roepend of hij hen
wilde ontvangen.
Hij kwam buiten.
Uilenspiegel liet den provoost niet spreken, die, hoestend, zich
gereedmaakte om hem te beschuldigen, en zegde:
--Heer, in stee van raven, heb ik twee edele verraders van uw gevolg
gedood.
Vervolgens vertelde hij wat hij gezien, gehoord en gedaan had.
De Zwijger sprak geen woord. De twee lijken werden afgetast in
bijzijn van hem, Willem van Oranje, van Frederik van Hollenhausen,
van den markgraaf van Hessen, van Diederik van Schoonenberg, van
graaf Albrecht van Nassau, van den graaf van Hoogstraten, van Antonius
van Lalaing, stadhouder van Mechelen, alsmede van de soldaten en van
Lamme, die beefde als een riet. Op de edellieden werden verzegelde
brieven van Granvelle en Noircarmes gevonden, waarbij zij aangezocht
werden verdeeling te zaaien in 's prinsen gevolg, om zijne krachten te
verzwakken, hem te dwingen zich te onderwerpen en hem aldus te leveren
aan den hertog van Alva, ten einde onthoofd te worden, naarvolgens
verdienste. Gij moet, zeiden de brieven, omzichtig te werk gaan, en met
bedekte woorden doen gelooven aan die van het leger, dat de Zwijger,
in zijn eigen voordeel alleen, reeds met den hertog heeft onderhandeld;
zijn vertoornde hoofdmannen en soldaten zullen hem gevangennemen. Als
belooning werd aan elk hunner een wissel van vijfhonderd dukaten
gezonden op het huis Függer van Antwerpen; zij zouden nog duizend
dukaten krijgen, zoodra in Zeeland de Spaansche schepen aankwamen,
met de vierhonderd duizend dukaten die men verwachtte.
Het eedgespan ontdekt zijnde, wendde de prins zich naar de edelen,
heeren en soldaten, onder dewelken een groot getal hem verdachten;
zonder spreken wees hij naar de twee lijken, om hun hun wantrouwen
te verwijten.
Allen riepen met groot rumoer:
--Lang leve Oranje! Oranje is den landen getrouw!
Vol verachting wilden zij de lijken aan de honden werpen; maar de
Zwijger sprak:
--Het zijn die lijken niet, die men aan de honden moet werpen, maar
de zwakheid des geestes, die aan de zuiverste inzichten twijfelen doet.
En de heeren en soldaten riepen:
--Leve de prins! Leve Oranje, de vriend onzer landen!
En hunne stemmen klonken als de donder, dreigend voor 't onrecht.
Naar de lichamen wijzend, zeide de prins:
--Begraaft ze als kerstenen.
--En wat gaat men met mij doen? vroeg Uilenspiegel. Dat men mij
kastijde als ik kwaad, en loone als ik goed deed.
Toen sprak de Zwijger:
--Die soldaat zal in mijne tegenwoordigheid vijftig slagen krijgen
met een stok van groen hout, omdat hij, in weerwil van alle tucht
en zonder bevel, twee edellieden doodde. Ook zal hij dertig gulden
ontvangen, omdat hij zoo goed gezien en gehoord heeft.
--Heer, sprak Uilenspiegel, als men mij eerst de dertig gulden gaf,
zou ik de stokslagen met meer geduld ontvangen.
--Ja, ja, zuchtte Lamme Goedzak, lang hem eerst de dertig gulden;
de slagen zal hij deemoedig verdragen.
--En overigens, sprak Uilenspiegel, daar mijn geweten zuiver is, heb ik
niet van doen gewasschen of gespoeld te worden met stokken of zweepen.
--Ja, zuchtte Lamme Goedzak opnieuw, Uilenspiegel heeft niet van noode
gewasschen of gespoeld te worden. Zijn geweten is zuiver. Wascht hem
niet, mijne heeren, wascht hem toch niet!
Uilenspiegel had de dertig gulden ontvangen, als de provoost den
stokmeester gebood, Uilenspiegel onder handen te nemen.
--Ziet toch, mijne heeren, zegde Lamme, wat jammerlijk gezicht hij
trekt. Hij is in 't geheel geen liefhebber van stokken, mijn vriend
Uilenspiegel.
--Een schoonen, goed getakten esch, die met zijn frischgroene bladeren
in de zonne prijkt, zie ik geerne, hernam Uilenspiegel; maar ik koester
een doodelijken haat tegen die leelijke stokken, die nog nat zijn,
zonder twijgen of bladeren, die hard en woest zijn van uitzicht,
--Zijt gij gereed? vroeg de provoost.
--Gereed, herhaalde Uilenspiegel, gereed tot wat? Om geslagen te
worden? Neen, dat ben ik niet en zal het nooit wezen, mijnheer de
stokmeester. Uw baard is ros en gij ziet er vreeselijk uit; maar
ik ben zeker, dat gij zachtmoedig van aard zijt en met tegenzin een
armen man, als ik, zoudt afranselen. Ik moet het u zeggen, maar slaan
doe of zie ik niet geerne, want de rug van een kerstenmensch is een
heilige tempel, die, evenals de borst, de longen bevat met dewelke
wij Gods goede lucht ademen. Heel uw leven door, zou de wroeging u
knagen als een ruwe stokslag mij aan stukken sloeg.
--Spoed u, sprak de stokmeester.
--Heer, zegde Uilenspiegel tot den prins, er is geene haast bij, ge
moogt mij gelooven; eerst zoudt gij dien stok moeten laten goed drogen,
want men zegt, dat het sap van groen hout een doodelijk vergif voor
het bloed is. Zou uwe Hoogheid mij zulken vreeselijken dood willen
zien sterven? Heer, ik behoud mijnen rug ten dienste Uwer Hoogheid;
laat hem slaan met roeden, hem striemen met de zweep; maar, als gij
mij niet wilt zien sterven, Heer, spaar mij toch het groen hout,
als het u belieft.
--Prins, schenk hem genade, spraken beiden, de heer van Hoogstraten
en Diederik van Schoonenberg. De anderen glimlachten goedhertig
en medelijdend.
Lamme kwam achteraan en zuchtte:
--Heer, genade, heer; groen hout is doodelijk vergif.
Toen sprak de prins:
--Ik schenk hem genade.
Uilenspiegel maakte eene tuimelpert, sloeg op Lamme's buik, dwong
hem tot dansen en sprak:
--Loof met mij Zijne Hoogheid, die mij van het groen hout heeft gered.
En Lamme beproefde te dansen, maar hij kon niet, ter oorzake van zijn
dikken buik.
En Uilenspiegel trakteerde hem en liet hem eten en drinken, zooveel
als hij kon.
XII.
De hertog wilde geen slag leveren, doch bestookte den Zwijger op 't
platteland tusschen Gulik en de Maas; Oranje deed overal den stroom
peilen, te Hond, Mechelen, Elsen, Meersen, en overal vonden zij er
voetangels in, om de mannen en peerden te kwetsen, die zouden pogen
den stroom over te steken.
Te Stokhem vonden de peilers er geene. De prins beval daar te waden. De
ruiters togen over den stroom en hielden zich aan den overkant in
slagorde, om het overzetten der troepen langs den kant van het bisdom
Luik te dekken; vervolgens kwamen, van den eenen tot den anderen oever,
tien rotten busschutters en boogschutters staan, die aldus den loop van
de Maas stremden, en in het midden van welke zich Uilenspiegel bevond.
Hij stond tot aan de dijen in 't water; somwijlen zelfs werden hij
en zijn peerd opgeheven door een plotselinge, verraderlijke golving.
Hij zag de voetknechten overgaan met een zakje buskruit op het
hoofd en hunne bussen omhoog; vervolgens kwamen de ammunitiewagens,
de haakbussen, de geleiders, de stukrijders, de slangen, de dubbele
slangen, de falkonetten, de dubbele falkonetten, de serpenten, de
halve serpenten, de dubbele serpenten, de slangen met wijden mond, de
kanonnen, de halve kanonnen, de dubbele kanonnen, de donderbussen, de
sakers, de kleine stukken bereden veldgeschut, geladen op voorwagens,
met twee peerden bespannen, en die in alles geleken op de kanonnen,
die men de Pistolen des keizers heette; daarna kwamen Vlaamsche
ruiters en landsknechten, die de achterhoede moesten dekken.
Uilenspiegel zocht iets te drinken, dat hem verwarmen kon. De
boogschutter Riesencraft, een Hoogduitscher, een mager, reusachtig
en wreedaardig man, die nevens hem op zijn peerd zat te ronken,
rook geweldig naar brandewijn. Uilenspiegel zocht naar de flesch
op het kruis van zijn peerd, en vond ze aan zijnen schouderband
geknoopt. Hij sneed het koordeken door, nam de flesch en dronk lustig
van het verkwikkende nat. De gezellen boogschutters zeiden tot hem:
--Geef ons ook een slok.
En hij gaf hun de flesch. Als de brandewijn op was, bond hij 't
koordeken weer aan de flesch en wilde ze terugbrengen op de borst van
den soldenier. Toen hij den arm oplichtte om de bottel er onder te
steken, werd Riesencraft wakker. Naarde bottel grijpend, wilde hij
zijn gewone koe melken. Daar hij er echter geene melk meer in vond,
ontstak hij in hevige woede.
--Dief, sprak hij, wat hebt gij gedaan met mijn brandewijn?
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Uitgedronken. Onder doornatte ruiters is de brandewijn van één,
de brandewijn van allen. Gierig zijn is leelijk.
--Morgen daag ik u uit tot een tweegevecht, antwoordde Riesencraft,
en ik beloof u fatsoenlijk aan stukken te kappen.
--Wij zullen alles afkappen, sprak Uilenspiegel, hoofden, armen en
beenen. Maar zijt gij verstopt, dat uwe tronie zoo zuur ziet?
--Dat ben ik, sprak Riesencraft.
--Dan moet gij purgeeren, in stee van te vechten.
Zij kwamen overeen zich 's anderen daags met elkander te meten. Elk
mocht gekleed en uitgerust zijn lijk hij verkoos, en zij zouden naar
elkander kerven en kappen met een korten stootdegen.
Uilenspiegel vroeg, om voor zich zelven, den degen te mogen vervangen
door eenen stok, hetgeen hem toegestaan werd.
Intusschen waren al de soldaten over den stroom getogen en reeds
stelden zij zich in goede orde, op de bevelen hunner kapiteins en
kolonels. Nu verlieten ook de tien rotten schutters hunne vochtige
stelling.
En de Zwijger sprak:
--Wij marcheeren op Luik,
Uilenspiegel was er blijde om en riep met al de Vlamingen:
--Lang leve Oranje! Naar Luik! naar Luik!
Maar de vreemdelingen, en voornamelijk de Hoogduitschers zeiden, dat
zij te nat waren om te marcheeren. Te vergeefs bevestigde de prins
hun, dat zij naar een gewisse zegepraal gingen, naar eene stede met
hert en ziel hun toegedaan: zij wilden niet luisteren, en ontstaken
groote vuren om zich te warmen, met hunne onttuigde peerden.
De aanval der stad werd uitgesteld tot 's anderen daags; en Alva,
hoogst verbaasd over den stoutmoedigen overtocht, vernam door zijne
spionnen, dat de soldaten van den Zwijger nog niet bereid waren tot
den aanval.
Daarop deed hij Luik en heel de omliggende streek bedreigen alles in
vuur en vlam te zullen zetten, zoo de vrienden des prinsen er eenige
beweging maakten. Geeraard van Groesbeek, de bisschoppelijke serjant,
deed zijne soldaten wapenen tegen den prins, die te laat kwam door
de schuld der Hoogduitschers, benauwd voor een beetje water in hunne
schoenen.
XIII.
Uilenspiegel en Riesencraft hadden hunne getuigen gekozen; deze
beslisten, dat de twee soldaten te voet zouden vechten, totdat de
dood er op volgde, zoo dit den overwinnaar behaagde, want dit waren
de voorwaarden die Riesencraft stelde.
Het gevecht greep plaats in een kleine heide.
Reeds van den vroegen morgen had Riesencraft zijne kleedij van
boogschutter aan: de salade, dat is de helm, met ijzeren halsstuk,
zonder vizier, alsmede een maliënhemd zonder mouwen. Daar zijn ander
hemd aan stukken vaneen viel, stak hij het in zijnen helm om er in
geval van nood, pluksel van te maken. Hij nam eenen voetboog van goed
hout der Ardennen, eenen koker met dertig pijlen, een lange dagge,
doch geen tweehandig zweerd, dat een wapen der busschutters was. En hij
kwam naar het strijdperk op zijn handpeerd, dat met den oorlogszadel,
het met pluimen versierde hoofdharnas, en met een ijzeren borstharnas
opgetuigd was.
Uilenspiegel koos de uitrusting van een gewapenden ridder: tot rijdier
had hij een ezel; tot zadel de rokken eener deerne; het hoofdharnas
was van wisschen, versierd met wuivende schavelingen. Het borstharnas
van zijn rijdier was van spek, want zeide hij, het ijzer kost te duur,
het staal is buiten prijs en, wat het koper betreft, in de laatste
dagen heeft men er zooveel van noodig gehad om kanonnen te gieten,
dat er niet genoeg meer overblijft om een konijn uit te rusten; tot
hoofddeksel had hij een schoonen saladestruik, dien de slekken nog
niet opgegeten hadden; op de salade stak eene zwanepluim, om hem te
doen zingen als hij soms stierf.
Zijn stootdegen was een goede, lange, dikke stok van dennenhout, waarop
een bezem van dennentakken. Aan den linkerkant van zijnen zadel hing
zijn mes, van hout, aan zijne rechterzijde slingerde zijne strijdknots:
een vliertak met eene raap opgestoken. Zijn harnas bestond uit niets
dan gaten, met andere woorden: hij had er geen aan.
Als hij, aldus toegetakeld, plechtstatig het strijdperk binnenreed,
schoten de getuigen van Riesencraft in een luiden schaterlach, doch
de Hoogduitscher bleef norsch kijken met zijn bittere tronie.
Toen vroegen de getuigen van Uilenspiegel aan die van Riesencraft, dat
de Duitscher zijne uitrusting van maliën en ijzer zou uitdoen, vermits
Uilenspiegel slechts met lompen gepantserd was. Riesencraft stemde
er in toe. Daarop vroegen de getuigen van Riesencraft aan die van
Uilenspiegel hoe het kwam, dat de Vlaming met eenen bezem gewapend was.
--Gij liet mij toe den stootdegen door eenen stok te vervangen,
sprak Uilenspiegel, maar gij hebt mij niet verboden de takken er aan
te laten.
--Ga maar uw gang, spraken de vier getuigen.
Riesencraft zei geen woord, doch kapte, in zijne opgewondenheid,
met zijne stootdegen de schrale heideplanten af.
De getuigen zetten hem aan, zijn stootdegen neder te leggen en ook
eenen bezem te nemen, lijk Uilenspiegel.
Hij antwoordde:
--Als die truwant uit eigen beweging een zoo gemeen wapen koos,
is het dat hij meent daarmede zijn leven te kunnen verdedigen.
Daar Uilenspiegel opnieuw verklaarde, dat hij zijnen bezem wilde
gebruiken, drongen de vier getuigen niet verder aan en zeiden zij
dienvolgens, dat alles in regel was.
Beiden stonden tegenover elkander: Riesencraft op zijn peerd,
dat met ijzer geharnast, Uilenspiegel op zijnen ezel, die met spek
gepantserd was.
Uilenspiegel reed tot in het midden van het veld. Zijnen bezem recht
als eene lans houdend, zeide hij:
--Dat gespuis, dat, in het leger van dappere makkers, anders niets
doet dan schuimbekkend van woede, met een zure tronie rond te loopen om
ruzie te zoeken, stinkt erger dan pest, dan melaatschheid en dood. Waar
zij komen, vlucht de lach, versterft het blijde liedeken. Zij moeten
altoos brommen of vechten, en zij vervangen het heilig gevecht
voor het vaderland door het tweegevecht, dat het leger ondermijnt
tot vreugde van den vijand. Riesencraft, hier tegenwoordig, heeft,
om onschuldige poetsen, een en twintig zijner gezellen vermoord,
maar nimmer verrichtte hij zelf, in gevecht of schermutseling,
een schitterende heldendaad of erlangde hij om betoonden moed de
minste belooning. Nu, heden behaagt het mij, het ruige vel van dien
twistzieken hond eens averechts te borstelen.
Riesencraft antwoordde:
--Die dronkelap heeft schoone dingen hooren vertellen over het
misbruik der tweegevechten; heden behaagt het mij hem het hoofd in
tweeën te klieven, om aan elkeen te toonen, dat er maar hooi in zijne
hersenpan steekt.
De getuigen deden hen afstijgen. Uilenspiegel liet van zijn hoofd
den saladestruik vallen, dien de ezel gretig binnensloeg; doch het
grauwtje werd in die bezigheid gestoord door eenen schop van een der
getuigen, om hem buiten de omheining van het strijdperk te drijven. Het
geharnaste peerd ontving mede zijn deel en de beide dieren gingen
eendrachtiglijk grazen in 't ronde.
De getuigen van Uilenspiegel, die eenen bezem droegen, en de getuigen
van Riesencraft, die eenen stootdegen voerden, gaven fluitend het
teeken van 't gevecht.
En Riesencraft en Uilenspiegel vochten als razenden: Riesencraft sloeg
met zijn stootdegen, Uilenspiegel weerde de slagen af met zijn bezem;
Riesencraft zwoer bij alle duivelen, Uilenspiegel ontweek de slagen,
liep schuins, draaide rechts, keerde links door de heide, stak de tong
uit en zette allerlei vieze gezichten naar Riesencraft, die, ziedend
van woede, buiten adem geraakte en blindelings als een dronkeman in
de lucht kapte. Als Uilenspiegel hem vlak achter zich voelde, keerde
hij zich plotseling om en gaf hem, met zijnen bezem, een forschen
slag onder den neus. Riesencraft viel neder met uitgestrekte armen
en beenen, lijk een kikvorsch op zijn uiterste.
Uilenspiegel wierp zich op hem, streek zonder genade den bezem rechts
en averechts over zijn aangezicht en sprak:
--Roep om genade, of ik doe u den bezem slikken!
En hij wreef en herwreef, tot groot genoegen van de omstanders,
en zeide altijd:
--Roep om genade, of ik doe u hem slikken!
Maar Riesencraft kon niet meer roepen, want hij was dood van woede
en gramschap.
--God hebbe uwe ziel, arme razende! zeide Uilenspiegel.
En treurig gestemd, toog hij henen.
XIV.
Het was het einde van Wijnmaand. Geld ontbrak aan den prins; zijne
soldaten hadden honger. Zij morden; de prins marcheerde naar Frankrijk
en bood den hertog 't gevecht aan, maar deze weigerde het.
Uit Quesnoy-le-Comte vertrokken om naar het land van Kamerijk te gaan,
ontmoette hij tien compagnieën Duitschers, acht vendels Spanjaards
en drie kornetten ruiterij, aangevoerd door don Ruffele Henricis,
zoon des hertogen, die te midden van het gevecht in het Spaansch riep:
--Slaat dood! Slaat dood! Geen kwartier! Leve de Paus!
Don Henricis met zijne mannen, tegenover de compagnie busschutters,
waarbij Uilenspiegel tiendenier was, wierp zich op hen.
Uilenspiegel zeide tot den bentserjant:
--De tong van dien beul ga ik in tweeën snijden!
--Snij maar op, zei de serjant.
En met een goed gerichten kogel, verplette Uilenspiegel tong en kaken
van don Ruffele Henricis, zoon van den hertog.
Uilenspiegel schoot ook den zoon van den markies Delmares van zijn
peerd.
De acht vendels en de drie kornetten werden verslagen.
Na die zegepraal zocht Uilenspiegel naar Lamme, in het kamp en in
't ronde, maar hij vond hem niet.
--Laas! sprak hij, hij is weg, mijn vriend Lamme, mijn dikke vriend. In
het vuur van den strijd zal hij het gewicht van zijn buik vergeten
en de Spaansche vluchtelingen achternagezet hebben. Buiten adem, zal
hij op den weg gevallen zijn als een zak. En zij zullen hem opgeraapt
hebben, om er losgeld van te trekken; losgeld voor kerstenspek. Vriend
Lamme, waar zijt gij toch, waar zijt gij, mijn arme, vette vriend?
Uilenspiegel zocht hem overal, en, hem niet vindend, was hij treurig
gestemd.
XV.
In de Slachtmaand, de maand der sneeuwstormen, ontbood de Zwijger
Uilenspiegel vóór zich. De prins beet op de koord van zijn maliënhemd.
--Luister goed, sprak hij.
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Mijne ooren zijn gevangenispoorten; men komt er gemakkelijk binnen,
maar uitgeraken is een andere zaak.
De Zwijger sprak:
--Ga door Namen, Henegouw, Vlaanderen, Zuid-Brabant, Antwerpen,
Noord-Brabant, Gelderland, Overijsel, Noord-Holland overal verkondigen,
dat, zoo het geluk onze heilige en kerstene zaak te lande verlaat,
de strijd tegen onrecht en geweld ter zee voortgezet wordt. God
bestiere genadig deze zaak, in voor- als in tegenspoed. Te Amsterdam
gekomen, zult gij Pauwel Buys, mijn getrouwe, rekenschap geven van
uwe zending. Hier zijn drie passen, door Alva zelven onderteekend en
gevonden op verslagenen te Quesnoy-le-Comte. Mijn schrijver heeft ze
behoorlijk ingevuld. Wellicht vindt gij onderwege een goeden gezel,
in wien gij vertrouwen moogt stellen. Goeden zijn zij, die op 't
gezang van den leeuwerik antwoorden met 't krijgshaftig gekraai van
den haan. Hier zijn vijftig gulden. Wees moedig en trouw.
--De assche klopt op mijn hert, antwoordde Uilenspiegel. En hij
toog henen.
XVI.
Met oorlof van den koning en van den hertog, mocht hij, naar believen,
alle wapenen dragen. Hij nam zijn goede radbus, patronen, alsmede
droog kruit. Vervolgens trok hij een gescheurd wambuis, een gelapt
opperste kleed en eene hooze met gaten aan; naar Spaansche wijs zette
hij eene toque met wuivende pluim op en gordde een zweerd om. Aldus
verliet hij het leger en stapte naar Maastricht.
De winterkoninkjes, voorboden der koude, vlogen rond de huizen, om
eene schuilplaats te zoeken. Den derden dag viel het aan 't sneeuwen.
Menigwerf moest Uilenspiegel onderwege zijne vrijgeleide vertoonen. Men
liet hem overal door. Hij zette zijn weg voort naar Luik.
Hij kwam in eene vlakte; een hevige wind joeg de vlokken in zijn
gezicht. Vóór zich zag hij de oneindige, witte vlakte, gesluierd door
dwarrelende sneeuwbuien. Drie wolven volgden hem op de hielen; hij
velde er eenen neder met zijne bus; de anderen wierpen zich op den
gewonde, trokken hem vaneen en liepen het bosch in, elk met een stuk.
Van dat gezelschap verlost, keek Uilenspiegel of er geen andere bende
in 't veld was. Ten einde de vlakte zag hij meerdere stipjes als
grijze standbeelden, die zich bewogen in den sneeuwstorm, en achter
hen, zwarte gedaanten van soldaten te peerd.
Hij klom op eenen boom. De wind bracht een verre geweeklaag
tot hem. "Wellicht", zeide hij in zichzelven, "wellicht zijn het
pelgrims met witte pijen: met moeite zie ik iets van hun lichaam in
de sneeuw." Vervolgens onderscheidde hij menschen, die naakt liepen,
en twee ruiters met zwarte harnassen op groote peerden gezeten,
welke die ellendige kudde met zweepslagen voortdreven. Hij wapende
zijne bus. Onder die ongelukkigen zag hij jongelieden en grijsaards,
naakt, bibberend, verkleumd, ineengedrongen, angstig voortloopend om
de zweep te ontvluchten van de twee soldaten, die, warm gekleed, rood
van brandewijn en goeden kost, er vermaak in schepten, het lichaam
dier naakte menschen tot bloedens toe te striemen, om ze nog sneller
te doen aanstappen.
Uilenspiegel sprak:
--Gij zult gewroken worden, assche van Klaas.
En hij zond een kogel in 't voorhoofd van een der ruiters, die dood
van zijn peerd viel. De andere, die niet wist van waar die onverwachte
kogel kwam, werd bang, en dacht dat vijanden in het bosch verborgen
waren. Hij wilde vluchten met het peerd van zijn makker. Maar terwijl
hij met den teugel van dat dier in de hand van zijn peerd steeg om
het geld van den doode te rooven, werd hij in den hals getroffen door
een anderen kogel en viel hij insgelijks dood ten gronde.
De naakten meenden, dat een engel des hemels, een goed schutter,
hun ter hulp kwam, en vielen op de knieën. Toen kwam Uilenspiegel van
zijnen boom en werd erkend door mannen uit den troep, die, als hij,
in het leger des prinsen gediend hadden. Zij zeiden tot hem:
--Uilenspiegel, in dezen jammerlijken staat werden wij uit Frankrijk
naar Maastricht gezonden, waar de hertog is, om daar behandeld te
worden als gevangen muitmakers; daar wij geen rantsoen kunnen betalen,
zijn wij van te voren veroordeeld om gefolterd en onthalsd te worden
of, als truwanten en diepers, op de galeien des konings te roeien.
Uilenspiegel gaf zijn opperste kleed aan den oudste der bende en sprak:
Komt, ik zal U naar Mézières leiden, maar eerst moeten wij dezen
soldaten hunne kleeren uittrekken en hunne peerden meenemen.
De wambuizen, hoozen, leerzen en hoeden der soldeniers werden verdeeld
onder de zwaksten en de zieksten, en Uilenspiegel sprak:
--Wij gaan in het bosch: daar is het zoo koud niet, de lucht is er
zoeter. Komt, broeders, komt mede.
Doch een der mannen viel ten gronde en zuchtte:
--Ik sterf van kou en van honger, en vóór God zal ik getuigen, dat
de paus de antichrist is.
En hij stierf. De anderen wilden hem meenemen, om hem als kerstenmensch
te begraven.
Terwijl zij op de groote baan gingen, zagen zij eenen boer met eene
huifkar. Als hij de naakte menschen zag, kreeg hij medelijden en deed
hij hen in zijne kar komen, waar zij hooi vonden om op te liggen en
ledige zakken om hun schamelheid te bedekken. Zij dankten God, dat
zij warm lagen. Uilenspiegel reed naast de kar op een van de peerden
der soldaten, terwijl hij de andere bij den toom leidde.
Te Mézières stapten zij uit de kar; daar gaf men hun goede soep, bier,
brood en kaas, en vleesch aan de ouderlingen en aan de vrouwlieden. En
zij werden geherbergd, gekleed en opnieuw gewapend ten koste van de
gemeente. En tot zegening kusten allen Uilenspiegel, die hen goedhertig
liet begaan.
Deze verkocht de peerden der twee ruiters voor acht en veertig gulden,
waarvan hij er dertig aan de verloste gevangenen gaf.
Eenzaam voortgaande, sprak hij in zich zelven:
--Ik ga langs puinhoopen, dood en bloed, zonder iets te vinden. De
duivelen hebben zeker gelogen. Waar is Lamme? Waar is Nele? Waar zijn
de Zeven?
En de assche van Klaas klopte op zijne borst. En hij hoorde eene stem
als een ademtocht fluisteren: "Zoek in dood, puinen en tranen".
En hij ging voort.
XVII.
In de Lentemaand kwam Uilenspiegel te Namen. Hij vond er Lamme, die
groot liefhebber geworden was van visch uit de Maas en hoofdzakelijk
van forellen. Hij had een boot gehuurd en vischte in den stroom met
toelating van de gemeente. Maar hij had vijftig gulden moeten betalen
aan de nering der vischverkoopers.
Zijne vangst at hij op of verkocht hij, en aldus herstelde hij de
rondheid van zijnen buik en vergaarde hij een zakje karolussen.
Toen hij zijn vriend Uilenspiegel op den oever van de Maas naar de
stadspoort zag stappen, was hij aangenaam verrast; hij stak zijn bootje
naar wal, klaverde den oever op, niet zonder blazen, en kwam naar hem.
Stamelend van genoegen, sprak hij:
--Zijt gij daar, mijn zoon, want ik mag u zoo noemen: mijn buik is
tweemaal zoo dik als de uwe. Waar gaat gij? Wat doet gij? Gij zijt
toch niet dood? Hebt gij mijne vrouw niet gezien? Gij zult visch uit
de Maas eten, de beste, die in dit tranendal bestaat; hier maken ze
sausen, dat men er de pan bij zou opeten. Gij zijt schoon en vroom,
met uwe kaken gebruind door 't gevecht. Daar is hij eindelijk, mijn
zoon, mijn vriend Uilenspiegel, de lustige zwerver!
En stille vroeg hij hem:
--Hoeveel Spanjolen hebt gij geknipt? Hebt gij mijne vrouw niet
gezien in hunne karren met loddegen? En gij zult wijn van de Maas
drinken; hij is heerlijk en bevordert de spijsvertering. Zijt gij
gekwetst, mijn zoon? Gij blijft dus hier, frisch, gezond en wel te
pas als een veulen. En de paling moet gij proeven! Niet de minste
grachtsmaak! Omhels mij, mijn vriend! Bij God, wat ben ik tevreden!
En Lamme danste, sprong, blies en dwong ook Uilenspiegel tot dansen.
Toen stapten zij op naar Namen. Aan de poort van de stad toonde
Uilenspiegel zijn reispas, onderteekend door den hertog van Alva. En
Lamme leidde hem mede naar huis.
Terwijl hij den maaltijd bereidde, deed hij hem zijne lotgevallen
verhalen en vertelde hij ook zijn eigen wedervaren. Hij had, zeide hij,
het leger verlaten om een meisje te volgen, dat, naar hij meende, zijne
vrouw was. En zoo was hij tot in Namen gesukkeld. En gedurig vroeg hij:
--Hebt gij ze niet gezien?
--Ik heb er anderen gezien, met schoone gezichtjes, antwoordde
Uilenspiegel, en dat wèl in deze stede, waar allen verliefd schijnen.
--Om de waarheid te zeggen, sprak Lamme, ik kan er krijgen zooveel
als ik wil, maar ik blijf trouw aan mijne vrouw, want mijn jammerend
hert is vervuld van haar aandenken.
--Lijk uw buik van menigvuldige gerechten, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
Lamme hernam:
--Als ik verdriet heb, moet ik eten.
--Is uw verdriet eeuwigdurend? vroeg Uilenspiegel.
--Laas ja! sprak Lamme.
Meteen trok hij eene forel uit eene kuip.
--Zie eens, sprak hij, hoe schoon en hoe vast. Het vleesch is
rooskleurig als dat mijner vrouw. Morgen verlaten wij Namen; ik
heb een vollen zak guldens; wij zullen elk een ezel koopen en naar
Vlaanderen reizen.
--Gij zult er veel bij verliezen, sprak Uilenspiegel.
--Mijn hert trekt naar Damme, naar de plaats, waar zij mij vurig
beminde. Misschien wacht zij daar.
--Vermits gij het wilt, sprak Uilenspiegel, zullen wij morgen
vertrekken.
En inderdaad, 's anderen daags kochten zij ezels en reden zij naast
elkander de stad uit.
XVIII.
Een gure wind blies over de aarde. De lucht, die 's morgens helder
als de jeugd was, werd grijs als de oude dag. Het regende en hagelde.
Toen de regen opgehouden had, schudde Uilenspiegel zich, zeggende:
--De hemel drinkt zooveel dampen op, dat hij zich soms moet ontlasten.
Maar het begon weer te regenen en te hagelen, en nog meer dan de
eerste maal. De twee gezellen waren doornat.
Lamme zuchtte:
--Wij waren goed gewasschen, nu is men ons aan't spoelen! De zonne
kwam weer te voorschijn en blijgemoed stegen zij weder op hunne ezelen.
Doch nu begon het zoo moorddadig te hagelen, dat de droge takken der
boomen als met messen afgekapt werden.
Lamme sprak:
--Ho! een dak toch! Mijn arme vrouw! Waar zijt gij, goed vuurtje,
zoete kussen en lekkere hutsepot?
En hij weende, de dikzak.
Doch Uilenspiegel sprak:
--Wij jammeren en weeklagen; maar is het niet van ons zelven, dat
al onze kwalen ons komen? Het regent en hagelt op onze schouderen,
doch die winterregen kweekt malsche meiklaver. En de runderen zullen
loeien van genoegen. Wij zijn zonder schuilplaats, maar waarom trouwen
wij niet? Ik toch, ten minste, waarom trouw ik niet met Nele, die zoo
schoon en zoo braaf is, en die mij nu een goeden schotel boonen met
gestoofd vleesch zou voorzetten? Wij hebben dorst, niettegenstaande het
water, dat valt; waarom bleven wij niet bij een zelfde ambacht? Zij,
die meester aanveerd zijn, hebben heele tonnen bruinbier in hunne
kelders.
De assche van Klaas klopte op zijn hert, de hemel werd helder, de
zonne schitterde aan het uitspansel en Uilenspiegel sprak:
--Mevrouw de Zon, ik zeg u duizendmaal dank, ge komt onze lendenen
verwarmen; assche van Klaas, gij verwarmt ons hert en zegt ons dat
diegenen gezegend zijn, die zwerven voor de verlossing van den bodem
der vaderen.
--Ja, maar 'k heb honger, zei Lamme.
XIX.
Zij trokken eene afspanning binnen, en men gaf er hun te eten in de
kelderkamer. Uilenspiegel opende het venster en zag van daar eene
lochting, in dewelke een minnelijk, poezel meideken wandelde, met
ronden boezem en gouden lokken. Zij had anders niet aan dan een rok,
een wit linnen jakje en een zwart voorschoot met gaatjes.
Hemden en ander vrouwenlinnen hingen te drogen; het meisje was steeds
naar Uilenspiegel gekeerd, trok de hemden van de koorden, hing ze
weder op, glimlachte en keek gedurig naar Uilenspiegel.
In de nabijheid hoorde Uilenspiegel eenen haan kraaien en zag hij
eene voedster met een kind spelen, wiens gezichtje zij naar eenen
man toekeerde, terwijl zij zeide:
--Boelkin, trek oogskens naar vader, toe!
Het kind schreide.
En het aanvallig meideken bleef in de lochting ronddrentelen en het
linnen afnemen en weder ophangen.
--'t Is eene, die aan den hertog verkocht is, sprak Lamme. Het meideken
bracht heure handen voor heure oogen en tusschen de vingeren loerend,
keek ze lachend naar Uilenspiegel.
Vervolgens ging zij op een der gespannen koorden zitten en schommelde,
zonder met heure voeten den grond aan te raken. Onder 't schommelen,
liet zij Uilenspiegel heure blanke, ronde armen zien, bloot tot aan
heur schouderen en die de bleeke zonne bestraalde. Op en neder wippend,
bekeek zij hem gestadig. Hij ging buiten om tot heur te gaan. Lamme
volgde hem. Aan de haag van de lochting zocht Uilenspiegel eene
opening om door te geraken, doch te vergeefs.
Als het meideken hem zoo bezig zag, gluurde zij nogmaals glimlachend
tusschen heure vingeren.
Uilenspiegel wilde door de haag geraken, maar Lamme hield hem met
alle geweld tegen en sprak:
--Ga daar niet binnen, 't is eene verklikster, in dienst van den
Spanjaard: wij worden levend verbrand.
Toen wandelde het meisje rond in de lochting, met heur voorschoot
over heur gezicht, doch keek door de gaatjes om te zien of heur nieuwe
vriend nog niet kwam.
Uilenspiegel wilde met een forsigen wip over de haag springen, doch
hij werd weerhouden door Lamme, die hem, bij zijn been grijpend,
deed vallen en zeide:
--Koord, zweerd en galg, 't is eene verklikster, ga niet tot haar,
zeg ik u.
Uilenspiegel verweerde zich zoo goed hij kon. Het meideken stak het
hoofd over de haag en riep:
--Vaarwel, heer, dat de liefde Uwe Lankmoedigheid onderhoude.
En hij hoorde een spottenden schaterlach.
--Ha! sprak hij, in mijne ooren steekt dat als duizend speldeprikken!
Eene deur werd luidruchtig gesloten.
En hij was gansch weemoedig.
Lamme, die hem nog altoos vasthield, zeide tot hem:
--Met spijt denkt gij aan den verloren schat. Maar 't is eene
verklikster, die u in heur spionnennet zou lokken. En gij merkt het
niet: ik berst van lachen.
Uilenspiegel zei geen woord en de beide gezellen stegen weder op
hunne ezelen.
XX.
Zij reden sprakeloos voort, schrijlings op hun grauwtje gezeten.
Lamme kauwde zijn laatsten maaltijd, terwijl hij blijgemoed met volle
teugen de frissche lucht ademde.
Plotseling gaf Uilenspiegel hem eenen zweepslag over zijn achterste,
dat met een band rond den zadel lag.
--Wat doet gij? riep Lamme jammerend uit.
--Wat? vroeg Uilenspiegel.
--Die zweepslag, zei Lamme.
--Welke zweepslag?
--Dien gij mij daar geeft, hervatte Lamme.
--Links? vroeg Uilenspiegel.
--Ja, links en op mijn achterste. Waarom deedt gij dat, schaamtelooze
nietdeug?
--Uit onwetendheid, antwoordde Uilenspiegel. Ik weet heel goed wat
een zweep is, en ook heel goed wat een achterste is, dat op eenen
zadel gespannen zit. Nu, als ik het uwe, breed, gespannen over den
zadel zag steken, zei ik in mijn zelven: Daar men met de vingeren
er niet in kan nijpen, kan het koordeken van de zweep er ook niet op
bijten. Ik was mis, ik beken het rechtuit.
Lamme glimlachte op die rede, en Uilenspiegel vervolgde:
--Maar ik ben de eenige niet op de wereld, die uit onwetendheid
zondigt, en meer dan één dwaze meester, die zijn overtollig vet op den
zadel eens ezels ten toon spreidt, zou mij daar lessen in geven. Als
mijne zweep zich vergat ten opzichte van uw achterste, vergat gij u
nog meer ten opzichte van mijne beenen, door hun te beletten achter
het meisje te loopen, dat in de lochting mij zoo lodderlijk wenkte.
--Aas voor de raven, zei Lamme, 't was dus uit wraaklust?
--Een heel klein beetje, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
XXI.
Nele leefde bedroefd en eenzaam te Damme bij Katelijne, die om den
ijskouden duivel riep, maar dewelke niet kwam.
--Ach! zei ze, gij zijt rijk, Hansken, en zoudt mij de zevenhonderd
karolussen kunnen terugbrengen. Soetkin zou op aarde terugkomen en
Klaas zou tevreden zijn in het hemelrijk; gij moet ze teruggeven. Doe
het vuur weg, de ziel wil er uit, maak een gat, mijn ziel wil er uit.
En gedurig wees zij met den vinger naar de plaats, waar het werk heur
hoofd verbrand had.
Katelijne was nu zeer arm, doch de buren stonden haar bij met boonen,
met brood en met vleesch, al naarvolgens hunne middelen. Ook de
disch gaf heur wat geld. En Nele naaide voor de rijke poorteressen,
ging uit strijken en verdiende aldus een gulden per week.
En Katelijne riep altoos:
--Maak een gat, laat mijne ziel er uit. Zij klopt om buiten te
zijn. Hij zal de zevenhonderd karolussen teruggeven.
En weenend aanhoorde Nele heur waanzinnige reden.
XXII.
Doch Uilenspiegel en Lamme, met hunne reispassen op zak, trokken een
kleine taveerne binnen, tegen de rotsen der Samber gebouwd, die op
sommige plaatsen met boomen bedekt zijn. En boven de deur stond te
lezen: Bij Marlaire.
Zij dronken menige bottel wijn van de Maas, bereid naar de wijze van
Bourgondië, en aten veel waterzooi; daarna begonnen zij te praten met
den baas, een eersten paapschgezinde, maar die gestadig heimelijk
knipoogde, en babbelde als een ekster, ter oorzake van den wijn,
dien hij gedronken had.
Uilenspiegel, die in de gaten had dat achter dat knipoogen iets
schuilde, deed hem nog meer drinken, zoodat de weerd begon te dansen
en te schaterlachen. Vervolgens kwam hij weer aan de tafel zitten
en sprak:
--Goede katholieken, ik drink op uwe gezondheid!
--Op de uwe! antwoordden Lamme en Uilenspiegel. Op de uitroeiing van
ketters en muitmakers!
En Lamme en Uilenspiegel vulden gestadig den beker, dien de weerd
dadelijk weer leeg dronk.
--Gij zijt brave lieden, en ik drink op uwe gezondheid. Hoe meer ik
drink, hoe grooter mijn winst is. Waar zijn uwe passen?
--Hier, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Geteekend door den hertog, sprak de weerd. Ik drink op den hertog!
--Wij drinken op de gezondheid van den hertog, antwoordden Lamme
en Uilenspiegel.
De weerd vervolgde:
--Waarmee vangt men ratten en muizen? Met vallen, niet waar? Wie
is de muis? 't Is de groote Oranjeketter, die rood ziet als 't
vuur van de hel. God is met ons. Zij komen weldra. He! He! laat
ons drinken! Schenkt in; ik kook, ik brand. Laat ons drinken! Heel
schoone gereformeerde predikantjes.... Ik herhaal predikantjes, dapper
en sterk lijk eiken, onze kloeke soldaten.... Laat ons drinken! Gaat
gij met hen mede naar 't kamp van den aartsketter? Reispassen heb ik,
geteekend door hem.... Gij zult hen aan 't werk zien.
--Wij gaan mee naar het kamp!
Zij zullen er zich deugd doen, en 's nachts, als de gelegenheid
gunstig is (en fluitend maakte de weerd het gebaar van een man, die
een anderen keelt), zal Stalen Wind de meerle Nassau het schuifelen
wel afleeren. Laat ons drinken, laat ons drinken!
--Gij zijt een vroolijke kwant, al zijt gij getrouwd, antwoordde
Uilenspiegel.
De weerd sprak:
--Dat ben ik of was ik nooit. Ik bewaar de geheimen der vorsten. Laat
ons drinken!--Had ik eene vrouw, zij zou ze mij ontstelen op 't
oorkussen, om mij te doen hangen, en weduwe zijn vóór de Natuur het
beliefde. Bij God! Zij komen.... Waar zijn de nieuwe reispassen? Op
mijn christelijk hert. Laat ons drinken! Dáár zijn ze, op driehonderd
stappen van hier, op den weg, nabij Marche-les-Dames. Ziet gij ze? Laat
ons drinken!
--Drink, zeide Uilenspiegel, drink; ik drink op de gezondheid van
den koning, van den hertog, van de predikanten, van Stalen Wind; op
uwe gezondheid, op mijne gezondheid, op de gezondheid van den wijn
en op de gezondheid van de bottels! Maar gij drinkt niet....
En op elken heildronk vulde Uilenspiegel het glas en ledigde de weerd
het tot den bodem.
Uilenspiegel sloeg hem eene wijl gade; toen stond hij recht en
sprak hij:
--Hij slaapt, laat ons gaan, Lamme.
En toen zij buiten waren, hernam hij:
--Hij heeft geene vrouw, die ons zal verraden.... De nacht gaat
vallen.... Hebt gij gehoord wat de schoft gezegd heeft, en weet gij
wie de drie predikanten zijn?
--Ja, sprak Lamme.
--Gij weet, dat zij van Marche-les-Dames komen langs den oever der
Maas, en dat wij wèl zullen doen, hen op den weg af te wachten,
vóór Stalen Wind blaast.
--Ja, zei Lamme.
--Wij moeten het leven des prinsen redden, sprak Uilenspiegel.
--Wij moeten, zei Lamme.
--Hier is mijn bus, sprak Uilenspiegel, ga er mee in het kreupelhout
tusschen de rotsen; laad ze met twee kogels en schiet als ge mij lijk
de raaf hoort krassen.
--Ik zal, zei Lamme.
En hij verdween in het kreupelhout. En Uilenspiegel hoorde weldra
het gekraak van het rad van de bus.
--Ziet gij ze komen? vroeg hij.
--Ik zie ze, antwoordde Lamme. Zij zijn gedrieën en gaan als soldaten,
en een hunner is een kop grooter dan de anderen.
Uilenspiegel zette zich neer op den weg, de beenen vooruit,
paternosters te mompelen, lijk de bedelaars doen. En zijn hoedeken
lag tusschen zijne knieën.
Als de drie predikanten voorbijkwamen, stak hij hun zijn hoedeken
toe. Maar zij legden er niemendal in.
Uilenspiegel stond recht en zeide op erbarmelijken toon;
--Goede heeren, weigert geen oortje aan een armen werkman, die
laatst in eene steengroef gevallen is en zich de ribben brak. Ze
zijn hardvochtig in deze streek en ze hebben mij niets gegeven,
om mijn ellende te lenigen. Laas! geeft mij een oortje en ik zal
voor u bidden. En God zal uwe bermhertigheid hier op de aarde met
vreugde beloonen.
--Mijn zoon, sprak een der predikanten, een sterke vent, voor ons geene
vreugde op aarde, zoolang de Paus en de Inquisitie zullen heerschen.
Uilenspiegel zuchtte als hij, en sprak:
--Laas! wat zegt gij, mijne heeren? Spreekt stiller, als het u
belieft. Maar geeft mij een oortje.
--Mijn zoon, antwoordde een kleine predikant met een strijdlustige
tronie, wij, arme martelaren, hebben maar juist oortjes genoeg om
onderwege onze nooddruft te koopen.
Uilenspiegel viel op de knieën.
--Zegent mij dan ten minste, sprak hij.
De drie predikanten strekten de hand uit over Uilenspiegels hoofd,
maar zonder godsvertrouwen.
Doch daar hij merkte dat zij mager waren, en toch dikke buiken hadden,
richtte hij zich op en gebaarde te vallen. En met het voorhoofd tegen
den buik van den grooten predikant botsend, hoorde hij daarin het
vroolijk gerinkel van geldstukken.
Toen sprong hij recht en, zijn kruismes trekkend, riep hij:
--Goede vaders, het is koel, ik ben dun gekleed, en gij hebt te
veel. Geeft mij van uwe wol, dat ik er mij een mantel van make. Ik
ben Geus! Leve de Geus!
De groote predikant antwoordde:
--Geus, gij draagt uwen kam te hoog; wij zullen hem kappen.
--Kappen! sprak Uilenspiegel; ik zeg u, dat Stalen Wind u, vóór den
prins, zal omverblazen. Geus ben ik, leve de Geus!
De drie onthutste predikanten spraken:
--Hoe weet hij dat? Wij zijn verraden. Ter dood! Leve de misse!
En van onder hunne hooze trokken zij goed aangezette kruismessen uit.
Maar zonder hen af te wachten, week Uilenspiegel achteruit, langs
het struikgewas, waarin Lamme verscholen zat.
Als hij oordeelde, dat de predikanten binnen het bereik van het schot
waren, riep hij:
--Raven, zwarte raven, Looden Wind blaast! Ik zing uwen dood.
En hij kraste.
Een busschot kwam uit het struikgewas, smeet den grootsten predikant
met zijn gezicht ter aarde. Een tweede schot velde den tweeden.
En Uilenspiegel ontwaarde tusschen het struikgewas de goede tronie van
Lamme, en zijn opgeheven arm, die haastiglijk de bus opnieuw laadde.
Een blauwe rookwolk steeg op uit het donker struikgewas.
De derde predikant viel, als in razernij, op Uilenspiegel aan,
die zeide:
--Stalen Wind of Looden Wind, ook gij verhuist naar de andere wereld!
En hij greep hem aan en hij stond dapper te weer.
Elkaar scherp in het oog houdend, stonden de beide vijanden pal op den
weg, steken toebrengend en afwerend. Uilenspiegel was heel met bloed
bedekt, want zijn tegenstander, behendig soldaat, had hem gekwetst
aan hoofd en been. Maar hij vocht als een leeuw. Het bloed gutste
uit zijn hoofd, en verblindde hem: toch weerde hij af, met groote
achterweertsche passen. Met de linkerhand wischte hij zijn bloed af,
maar zijne krachten verflauwden. Zeker ware hij gedood, hadde Lamme,
met een derde schot, den predikant niet geveld.
En een vloek stierf op zijne lippen, terwijl hij bloed en doods-schuim
braakte.
En opnieuw steeg een blauwe rookwolk uit het struikgewas, waartusschen
Lamme weer zijne goede tronie zien liet.
--Is 't gedaan? vroeg hij.
--Ja, mijn vriend, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, maar kom....
Als Lamme te voorschijn kwam, zag hij Uilenspiegel gansch met bloed
bedekt.
Ondanks zijnen buik, liep hij als een hert, en kwam bij Uilenspiegel,
die nabij de gedoode mannen zat.
--Hij is gekwetst, mijn goede vriend, sprak hij, gekwetst door dien
vuigen moordenaar!
En, met een schop, sloeg hij de tanden van een der predikanten stuk.
--Gij antwoordt niet, Uilenspiegel, hernam hij; gaat gij sterven? Waar
is de balsem? Ha, in de weitasch, onder de worsten.
... Uilenspiegel, hoort gij mij niet? Laas, ik heb geen warm
water om uwe wonden te wasschen, en er is geen middel om er
te krijgen. Maar ik haal water uit de Samber. Spreek toch, mijn
vriend. Gij zijt toch zóó erg niet gekwetst? Hier, een weinig koud
water, niet waar? Ha, hij wordt wakker. Ik ben het, uw vriend; ze
zijn allemaal dood. Linnen! linnen om zijne wonden te verbinden! Er
is er geen. Ha! mijn hemd!
Lamme kleedde zich uit en vervolgde:
--Aan stukken, het hemd! Het bloed is gestelpt. Mijn vriend zal niet
sterven.... 't Is koeltjes, zoo bloot in de vinnige lucht. Ik ga mij
weer aankleeden. Hij zal niet sterven. Ik ben het, Uilenspiegel, ik, uw
vriend Lamme. Hij glimlacht. Ik ga de moordenaars aftasten. Zij hebben
guldens in hunnen buik. Ja, zij hebben gouden darmen: karolussen,
daalders, lammeren, florijnen, oortjes en brieven! Wij zijn rijk! Meer
dan driehonderd karolussen voor ons getweeën. Wij zullen de wapenen
nemen en 't geld. Stalen Wind zal niet blazen voor den edelen prins!
Uilenspiegel klappertandde door de koude, en stond op.
--Daar zijt gij op de beenen! sprak Lamme.
--Door de kracht van den balsem, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Balsem van dapperheid! zeide Lamme.
Vervolgens sleepte hij de lijken van de predikanten een voor een
voort, en smeet ze in een hol, tusschen de rotsen, met hunne wapenen
en hunne kleederen, behalve den mantel.
In de lucht fladderden de raven, krassend van ongeduldige vraatzucht.
En de Samber vloeide als een stalen stroom, onder den grauwen hemel.
En de sneeuw viel en wischte de bloedvlekken uit. Maar toch waren
zij ongerust en bekommerd.
Lamme sprak:
--Ik dood liever een kieken dan een mensch.
En zij stegen weder op hunne ezels.
Aan de poorten van Hoei, bloedden de wonden nog altijd; de vrienden
gebaarden daar twist te krijgen, stegen van hunne ezels en schermden
met hunne kruismessen. Na het gevecht, dat zeer wreed in schijn was,
stegen zij weder op hunne dieren en kwamen binnen de stede, nadat
zij aan de poorten hunne reispassen hadden getoond.
Toen de vrouwen Uilenspiegel gekwetst en Lamme zegevierend op zijn
ezel zagen, keken zij met teeder medelijden naar Uilenspiegel en
dreigden zij Lamme met de vuist, zeggende:
--Dáár is de deugniet, die zijn vriend schier vermoordde.
Lamme, ongerust, keek of hij onder haar zijn vrouwtje niet vond.
Hij zocht te vergeefs, wat hem in een weemoedige stemming bracht.
XXIII.
--Waar gaan wij henen? vroeg Lamme.
--Naar Maastricht, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Maar, mijn zoon, men zegt dat het leger des hertogen rond Maastricht
samengebracht is en dat Alva zelf in die stede verblijft. Onze
reispassen zullen niet voldoende zijn. En al hadden de Spaansche
soldeniers er mede genoegen, wij zouden niettemin in de stad gehouden
en ondervraagd worden. Ondertusschen zouden zij den moord van de
predikanten vernemen en zouden wij aan het leven vaarwel mogen zeggen.
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--De raven, uilen en gieren zullen al het vleesch aftrekken, zoodat
hun aangezicht onkennelijk zal geworden zijn. Wat onze passen betreft,
die zouden wel goed zijn; maar als men den moord vernam, zouden wij
gewis, zooals gij zegt, aangehouden worden. Daar wij te Maastricht
wezen moeten, zullen wij over Landen trekken.
--Ze zullen ons ophangen, zei Lamme.
--We zullen er wel door geraken, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
Aldus koutend kwamen zij in de afspanning de Ekster, waar zij goed
eten, goede slaping en hooi voor hunne ezelen vonden.
's Anderen daags begaven zij zich op weg naar Landen.
Toen zij omtrent een groote hoeve, nabij de stad kwamen, floot
Uilenspiegel als de Leeuwerik, en dadelijk antwoordde daarop, van
binnen, een helder hanengekraai. Een cijnzenaar met een goedig gezicht
verscheen op den drempel der hoeve. Hij riep hun toe:
--Vrienden, leve de Geus! komt binnen.
--Wie is dat? vroeg Lamme.
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Thomas Utenhove, de dappere hervormde; de knechts en dienstmaagden
zijner hoeve ijveren als hij voor het vrije geweten.
Utenhove sprak toen:
--Gij zijt zendelingen des prinsen. Eet en drinkt.
En de hesp siste in de pan en de worsten insgelijks; en de wijn werd
opgebracht en de glazen gevuld. En Lamme dronk als een tempelier en
liet zich de spijzen goed smaken.
De knechts en meiden van de hoeve kwamen beurtelings voor de
halfgeopende deur kijken, om hem met de tanden te zien werken. En de
mannen zeiden, begeerig, dat zij wel zooveel zouden eten als hij.
Op het einde van den maaltijd, sprak Thomas Utenhove:
--Honderd boeren zullen deze week van hier vertrekken; zij zeggen
dat zij aan de dijken van Brugge en omstreken gaan werken. Zij reizen
bij troepen van vijf of zes, en langs verschillende wegen. Te Brugge
zullen zij schuiten vinden, die hen over zee naar Emden zullen brengen.
--Hebben zij wapenen en geld? vroeg Uilenspiegel.
--Elkeen heeft tien gulden en een hertsvanger, antwoordde Utenhove.
--God en de prins zullen U loonen!
--Ik behoef geene belooning; wat ik doe, doe ik uit overtuiging,
zeide Utenhove.
--Vriend gastheer, vroeg Lamme, die dikke zwarte pensen aan 't peuzelen
was, hoe krijgt gij ze zoo geurig, zoo smakelijk en zoo fijn van vet?
--Wij doen er kaneel en kattenkruid in, antwoordde de gastheer.
Vervolgens vroeg hij aan Uilenspiegel:
--Hoort Edzard, grave van Friesland, nog steeds tot den aanhang
des prinsen?
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Openlijk niet, maar toch verleent hij te Emden schuilplaats aan
zijne vaartuigen.
En hij voegde er bij:
--Wij moeten naar Maastricht.
--Dat zult gij niet kunnen, sprak de gastheer; het leger des hertogen
is vóór de stad en in 't ronde.
Vervolgens bracht hij hem naar den zolder; daar toonde hij hem van
verre de vendels en kornetten ruiterij en voetvolk, die door het veld
reden en marcheerden.
Uilenspiegel sprak:
--Ik geraak er wel door, zoo gij, die hier machtig zijt, mij de
toelating geeft tot trouwen. De vrouw moet lieftallig, zachtaardig
en schoon zijn en moet, zoo niet voor altijd, dan toch voor eene week
met mij willen trouwen.
Lamme zuchtte en sprak:
--Doe dat niet, mijn vriend, zij zou u alleen laten, zonder kommer
voor uw liefdevuur. Uw bed, waarop gij thans zoo vredevol slaapt, zal
eene koets van netelen worden, waaruit de zoete nachtrust vlieden zal.
--Ik trouw, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
En Lamme was diep bedroefd, omdat hij niets op de tafel meer vond. Maar
hij ontdekte krakelingen in eene schaal, en hij speelde ze weemoedig
binnen.
Uilenspiegel zei tot Thomas Utenhove:
--Nu, luister. Bezorg mij eene vrouw, rijk of arm. Ik ga met heur
naar de kerk en doe het huwelijk inzegenen door den pastoor. Deze
geeft ons een huwelijksbewijs, hoewel ongeldig, daar het komt van een
aanhanger der Inquisitie; wij doen er in schrijven, dat wij goede
kerstenen zijn, die gebiecht hebben en ten avondmaal gegaan zijn,
dat wij apostolisch leven volgens de regelen Onzer Heilige Moeder de
Roomsche Kerk,--die heure kinderen verbrandt,--om aldus over ons den
zegen te roepen van Onzen Heiligen Vader den Paus, van de hemelsche
en aardsche heirscharen, van de santen, santinnen, dekenen, pastoors,
monniken, soldeniers, serjanten, hangmannen en andere diepers. Met
dat kostbare bewijs op zak, maken wij de toebereidselen voor de
gebruikelijke speelreis.
--Maar de vrouw? vroeg Thomas Utenhove.
Die zult gij mij zoeken, antwoordde Uilenspiegel. Ik neem dus twee
speelwagens, die ik versier met sparre- en hulstetakken en papieren
festoen. En ik laat er de mannen in stijgen, die gij den prins
zenden wilt.
--Maar de vrouw? vroeg Thomas Utenhove.
--Die zal niet ver van hier zijn, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
En zijne rede vervolgend, sprak hij:
--Voor den eersten wagen span ik twee uwer peerden, voor den tweeden
onze beide ezelen. Den eersten wagen neem ik in met mijne vrouw,
mijn vriend Lamme, de getuigen; de tweede wagen is bestemd voor de
speellieden. Vervolgens trekken wij er op los, met wuivende vendels
en onder 't geschal van tamboerijnen, pijpen, schalmeien; zingend,
dansend en drinkend, rijden wij in vollen draf de groote baan op,
die naar het galgeveld of naar de vrijheid leidt!
--Ik wil u helpen, sprak Thomas Utenhove. Maar de vrouwlieden en
dochteren zullen heure mannen en minnaren willen volgen.
--Wij gaan mee op Gods genade, sprak een minzaam meideken, dat het
hoofd binnenstak.
--Als het noodig is, zei Thomas Utenhove, kunnen er vier wagens zijn;
aldus zouden wij meer dan vijf en twintig man aan den prins kunnen
sturen.
--De hertog zal het kind van de rekening zijn, sprak Uilenspiegel.
--En de vloot van den prins zal eenige dappere soldaten meer tellen,
antwoordde Thomas Utenhove.
Vervolgens deed hij het klokje luiden, om al zijne knechts en
dienstmaagden samen te roepen.
Toen allen vergaderd waren, sprak hij tot hen:
--Gij allen, die Zeeuwen zijt, mannen als vrouwlieden, luistert:
Uilenspiegel, de Vlaming, hier tegenwoordig, wil U in bruidsgewaad
door het leger des hertogen brengen.
De mannen en vrouwen van Zeeland riepen te gelijk:
--Doodsgevaar! wij zijn er bij!
En de mannen zeiden tot elkaar:
--Voor ons is het een geluk, een land van dienstbaarheid te verlaten
om de vrije zee te bevaren. Als God er vóór is, wie zal er tegen zijn?
De vrouwlieden en meidekens spraken:
--Wij volgen onze mannen en vrienden. Wij zijn uit Zeeland en zullen
er schuilplaatse vinden.
Uilenspiegel wendde zich tot een jong en liefelijk meideken uit den
troep, en zei schertsend:
--Met u wil ik trouwen.
Doch blozend antwoordde zij:
--Ik wil wel; doch alléén in de kerk.
De vrouwen spraken lachend tot elkaar:
--Heur hert trekt naar Hans, den zoon van den baas. Hij vertrekt
zeker met heur.
--Ja, antwoordde Hans.
En de vader zei tot hem:
--Gij moogt.
De mannen trokken hunne beste kleederen aan: fluweelen wambuis en
hooze, met het groot opperste kleed daarboven, en zetten breedgerande
hoeden op 't hoofd, die hen tegen zon en regen zouden beschutten; ook
de vrouwen kleedden zich in feestdos: gebekte zwarte onderbroeken,
geplooide witte halskragen, hemelsblauwe en scharlakenroode
borststukken met goudborduurselen, zwarte wollen rokken met breede
fluweelen banden van dezelfde kleur, zwarte saaien kousen en fluweelen
schoenen met zilveren gespen; op het voorhoofd hadden zij groote
klatermeersen, die de meidekens links en de getrouwde vrouwlieden
rechts droegen.
Vervolgens ging Thomas Utenhove naar de kerk, den pastoor verzoeken
Thijlbert, zoon van Klaas, in de wandeling Uilenspiegel geheeten,
dadelijk te willen trouwen met Tanneken Pieters. En meteen stak hij
den pastoor twee rijksdaalders in de hand: de parochiepaap stemde
gereedelijk toe.
Dienvolgens begaf Uilenspiegel zich naar de kerk met heel de bruiloft,
en daar trouwde hij, vóór den pastoor, met Tanneken, die zoo schoon
en zoo lief, zoo knap en zoo poezel was, dat hij zich moest inhouden
om niet in heure kaken te bijten, die op twee kriekappeltjes geleken.
En hij zeide heur dat hij het maar liet, uit eerbied voor heur lief
en zacht gezichtje. Maar schalksch zei ze:
--Wees toch stil, zie eens hoe Hans u beziet; hij zou u vermoorden!
En een meideken, dat jaloersch was, zei:
Zoek elders, Uilenspiegel, ziet gij niet dat zij bang is voor heuren
minnaar?
Lamme wreef in zijne handen en riep:
--Ge zult ze toch allen niet hebben!
En hij was in zijn schik.
Uilenspiegel droeg geduldig zijn lot en keerde met de bruiloft terug
naar de hoeve. Daar dronk men en zong men en deed hij bescheid met
het jaloersche meideken. Hans was er gansch in zijn schik om, maar
Tanneken niet, en de bruidegom van 't meideken evenmin.
Rond den middag, bij helderen zonneschijn en terwijl een frisch
windeken woei, reden de wagens voort; ze waren gansch versierd met
bloemen en loover, en met wapperende vendels. En ze vertrokken onder
't blijde geschal van pijpen, schalmeien, tamboerijnen en doedelzakken.
In 't kamp van Alva was 't een andere kermis. De posten en
schildwachten bliezen alarm en kwamen achtereenvolgens terug naar
het kamp, zeggende:
--De vijand nadert; wij hebben 't gerucht van pijpen en schalmeien
gehoord, en vendels gezien. 't Is een sterke afdeeling ruiterij die
ons zeker in een hinderlaag wil lokken. Het legerkorps is ongetwijfeld
in aantocht.
Dadelijk deed de hertog de kampmeesters, kolonels en hoplieden
verwittigen, het leger in slagorde stellen en den vijand verkennen.
Plotseling verschenen vier wagens, die op de busschutters toereden. In
de wagens waren de mannen en vrouwen aan 't dansen, bij 't blijde
gerinkel van bottels en glazen en 't luidruchtig geschal van pijpen,
schalmeien, trommelen en doedelzakken.
De bruiloft hield halt, en de hertog van Alva kwam zelf toegeloopen
op het gerucht en zag de jonge bruid op een van de wagens en, naast
heur, Uilenspiegel, heuren bruidegom, met zijn hoed vol bloemen; en
al de boeren en boerinnen waren van de wagens gesprongen en dansten
rond het jonge paar, en noodden de soldaten tot drinken.
Alva en de zijnen waren grootendeels verwonderd over den eenvoud
dier buitenlieden, die zongen en dansten, te midden van een leger,
dat in slagorde stond.
En allen, die in de wagens zaten, schonken wijn aan de Spaansche
soldaten.
En de Maranen zwaaiden met de hoeden en juichten hen toe.
Als de wijn op was, reden de boeren en boerinnen voort, onder 't
geschal van tamboerijnen, pijpen en doedelzakken. Niemand deed hun
de minste moeilijkheid aan.
Integendeel, de soldaten schoten een salvo met hunne bussen.
En zoo kwamen zij in Maastricht, waar Uilenspiegel zich verstond
met de hervormden om, door middel van schepen, een grooten voorraad
wapenen en munitie naar de vloot van den Zwijger te zenden.
Ook te Landen deden zij hetzelfde.
En, als daglooners gekleed, geraakten zij overal door.
De list kwam den hertog ter oore; en er werd een liedje op gemaakt,
dat hem gezonden werd, met dit refrein:
    Bloed-hertog, dwaas-hertog,
    Hebt ge de bruid gezien?
En telkens dat hij een verkeerde beweging gemaakt had, zongen de
soldaten:
    De hertog krijgt schele oogen,
    Hij heeft de bruid gezien.
XXIV.
Afgunst verteerde koning Philippus. In zijn hoogmoed bad hij jammerend
God, dat hij hem de macht zou geven Engeland te overwinnen, Frankrijk
te veroveren, Milaan, Genua en Venetië in te nemen en, meester der
zeeën, heel Europa te gebieden.
Hij dacht aan die zegepraal, maar hij lachte niet.
Gedurig was hij huiverig; de wijn verwarmde hem niet, noch het
vuur van het welriekend hout, dat altijd brandde in de zaal waar
hij verbleef. Daar zat hij te midden van zoovele brieven, dat men
er wel honderd tonnen mede had kunnen vullen; hij dacht aan de
alleen-heerschappij over gansch de aarde, zooals die uitgeoefend
werd door de Roomsche keizers, en aan den naijver en den haat die
hij zijnen zoon don Carlos toedroeg, sedert deze de plaats van den
hertog van Alva in de Nederlanden had willen innemen. En als hij hem
zag, mismaakt, zot en boosaardig, kwam er een nog grootere haat over
hem. Maar niemand sprak hij er over.
Zij, die den koning en zijnen zoon dienden, wisten niet wien zij
't meest moesten vreezen, óf den moordzieken kroonprins, die zijn
dienaren in 't gezicht krabde, òf den gluiperigen koning, die zich
van anderen bediende als hij iemand wilde treffen, en die als eene
hyena leefde van lijken.
De dienaren waren verschrikt als ze den een achter den anderen zagen
sluipen, en zeiden, dat men, in 't Escuriaal, weldra van dooden
zou hooren.
Weldra vernamen zij, dat don Carlos gevangen gezet was, wegens
hoogverraad. En zij wisten dat verdriet hem verteerde; dat hij door
de staven van zijn kerker had willen kruipen om te vluchten, en zich
aldus het aangezicht had gekwetst.
Ook wist men, dat mevrouwe Isabella van Frankrijk, zijne moeder,
gedurig weende.
Maar koning Philippus weende niet.
Ze kregen mare, dat men don Carlos versche vijgen gegeven had, en dat
hij 's anderen daags zoo zacht gestorven was alsof hij ingesluimerd
was.
De dokters zeiden: Zoodra hij de vijgen gegeten had, hield zijn hert
op met kloppen en werden de natuurlijke levensverrichtingen afgebroken;
zijn buik zwol op en zoo gaf hij den geest.
Koning Philippus woonde de uitvaart van don Carlos bij, deed hem
begraven in de kapel zijner koninklijke verblijfplaats en eenen steen
op zijn graf leggen, maar hij weende niet.
En spottend met het vorstelijk grafschrift, dat in dien steen was
gebeiteld, zeiden de dienaren tot elkander:
    HIER LIGT BEGRAVEN DEGENE DIE VERSCHE
    VIJGEN AT EN STIERF ZONDER ZIEK TE ZIJN.
    A qui jace qui en para desit verdad,
    Morio s'in infirmidad.
En koning Philippus bezag met ontuchtige blikken de prinses van
Eboli, die getrouwd was. Door drift verteerd, smeekte hij heur en
zij weerstond niet....
Mevrouwe Isabella van Frankrijk, die, naar men zeide, don Carlos'
inzichten op de Nederlanden begunstigd had, werd droef en mager. Heur
haar viel uit, met dikke lokken te gelijk. En dikwerf braakte zij,
en de nagelen heurer teenen en vingeren vielen uit. En zij stierf.
En koning Philippus weende niet.
Het haar van den prins van Eboli viel insgelijks uit. Hij werd droef
en klaagde gedurig. Dan vielen ook zijne nagelen van teenen en vingeren
uit. En hij stierf.
En de koning deed hem begraven.
En hij betaalde den rouw der weduwe, en weende niet.
XXV.
In dien tijd kwamen eenige vrouwlieden en meidekens van Damme vragen
aan Nele of zij meibruid wilde zijn en zich wilde verbergen in het
struikgewas, met den bruidegom dien men voor haar vinden zou; want,
zeiden de vrouwen, niet zonder afgunst, geen jongeling van Damme en
't ronde zou u versmaden; allen zouden willen trouwen met u, die
zoo schoon en zoo braaf, zoo jong en zoo frisch blijft: gave van
toovernij, gewis.
Nele antwoordde:
--Zegt tot de jongelieden, die mij tot huisvrouw zouden begeeren,
dat Nele's hert niet hier is, maar verre, bij hem die ronddoolt om den
grond der vaderen te verlossen. En zoo ik frisch blijf, lijk gij zegt,
is dit geene gave van tooverij, maar van gezondheid.
De vrouwen antwoordden:
--Katelijne nochtans wordt verdacht.
--Hecht geen geloof aan de woorden der boozen, antwoordde
Nele. Katelijne is geene tooveres. De heeren der vierschaar hebben werk
op heur hoofd verbrand, en God heeft heur met uitzinnigheid geslagen.
En Katelijne, die in een hoek op de hurken zat, schuddebolde en sprak:
--Doe het vuur uit, hij zal terugkomen, Hansken, mijn liefste.
De vrouwen vroegen wie het Hansken was, waarvan Katelijne sprak.
Nele antwoordde:
--De zoon van Klaas, mijn zoogbroeder, dien zij waant verloren te
hebben, sedert God heur zoo wreedelijk trof.
En de goede vrouwlieden gaven zilveren oortjes aan Katelijne.
En de nieuwe geldstukken die er bij waren, toonde zij eenen, dien
niemand zag, zeggende:
--Ik ben rijk, ik heb blinkend geld. Kom, Hansken, mijn liefste;
ik zal uwe koozerijen betalen.
En als de vrouwen henen waren, weende Nele in de eenzame hut. En ze
dacht aan Uilenspiegel, die in verre landen doolde en dien ze niet
volgen mocht, en ook aan Katelijne, die steende:--Doe het vuur uit! en
de beide handen op heure borst drukte, om te bedieden, dat het vuur
der uitzinnigheid brandde in heur hoofd en heur lijf.
En intusschen verborgen meibruid en meibruidegom zich in het hooge
gras.
De jongen, die de meibruid vond, was de koning van 't feest; was het
integendeel een meisje dat den bruidegom vond, dan was zij de koningin
van het meifeest.
Nele hoorde van verre de vreugdekreten van knapen en meidekens, toen de
meibruid aan den boord eener gracht, in het hooge gras, werd gevonden.
En zij weende als zij dacht aan den zoeten tijd, toen men heur en
heuren vriend Uilenspiegel zocht.
XXVI.
En Uilenspiegel en Lamme, schrijlings op hunne ezels gezeten,
vervolgden hunnen weg.
--Nu, Lamme, luister goed, sprak Uilenspiegel, de Nederlandsche edelen,
naijverig op den prins van Oranje, verrieden de zaak der eedgenooten,
het heilig verbond, het kloekmoedig eedverbond, dat geteekend was
voor het welzijn van den grond onzer vaderen. Egmond en Hoorne waren
ontrouw, doch zij vonden er niet het minste voordeel bij, integendeel;
Brederode is dood; in dezen oorlog blijven ons niets anders over dan
het arme volk van Brabant en Vlaanderen, dat op eerlijke hoofdmannen
wacht om op te rukken; en vervolgens, mijn jongen, de eilanden van
Zeeland en Noord-Holland, waarvan de prins stadhouder is; en verder
nog, op zee, Edzard, graaf van Emden en van Oost-Friesland.
--Laas! sprak Lamme, ik word het wel gewaar: wij dwalen rond tusschen
rad, galg en brandstapel, stervend van honger, stikkend van dorst,
zonder hoop ergens ruste te vinden.
--'t Is maar een begin, antwoordde Uilenspiegel. Ge moet toch bekennen,
dat ons bestaan heel vroolijk is: wij dooden onze vijanden; wij
spotten met hen, hebben onze tasschen vol florijnen en daalders; wij
zijn goed gevoed met vleesch, met brood en met wijn. Wat wilt gij nog
meer, pluimzak? Willen wij onze ezels verkoopen om peerden te koopen?
--Thijl, zeide Lamme, de draf van een peerd is tamelijk hard voor
een man, zoo vollijvig als ik.
--Gij kunt u te peerd zetten lijk de boeren, antwoordde Uilenspiegel,
en niemand zal u uitlachen, mits gij gekleed zijt als een boer en
geen zweerd draagt lijk ik, doch enkel eenen verkensspriet.
--Maar, vroeg Lamme, zijt gij wel zeker, dat onze passen kunnen dienen
in de kleine steden?
--Heb ik geen bewijs van den parochiepaap, sprak Uilenspiegel, met
een groot lakzegel van de kerk, dat er aanhangt met twee perkamenten
steerten; hebben wij ook onze biechtbriefkens niet? De huurlingen en
serjanten des hertogen vermogen niets tegen twee mannen, van zulke
goede papieren voorzien.
Lamme antwoordde niet.
--En de zwarte paternosters die wij verkoopen? vervolgde
Uilenspiegel. Wij beiden zijn ruiters, gij Vlaming, ik Duitscher,
wij reizen op uitdrukkelijk bevel van den hertog, om de ketters
dezer landen tot het heilig katholiek geloove terug te brengen,
door het verkoopen van gewijde voorwerpen. Aldus zullen wij overal
binnendringen, bij de groote heeren en in de rijke abdijen. En daar
zullen wij rijkelijk onthaald worden. En wij zullen hunne geheimen
ontstelen. Verblijd u van te voren, mijn zachtaardige vriend.
--Jongen, sprak Lamme, wat wij doen is werk van spionnen.
--Krachtens recht en oorlogswet, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Als zij de zaak der drie predikanten vernemen, worden wij
geradbraakt, zei Lamme.
Uilenspiegel zong:
    Leven steekt op mijn Vaandel uit,
    Leven in 't licht der rede.
    Lederen is mijn eerste huid,
    Stalen is mijn tweede.
Doch Lamme zuchtte:
--Ik, ik heb maar één vel, en het is zeer zacht; bij den minsten
daggeslag zou het seffens open liggen. Wij zouden beter doen ons
aan een of ander nuttig ambacht over te leveren, dan aldus van het
een oord naar 't ander te dolen, om al die groote prinsen te dienen,
die, met de voeten in fluweelen muilen, rustig, aan vergulde tafelen,
ortolanen eten. Voor ons de slagen, de gevaren, het gevecht, de regen,
de hagel, de sneeuwstormen en de magere soep van de zwervers; voor
hen, de heerlijke worsten, de vette kapoenen, de geurige lijsters,
de smakelijke ganzen.
--Het water komt in uwen mond, mijn zachtaardige vriend, sprak
Uilenspiegel.
--Waar zijt gij, nieuwbakken brood, geurige koekebakken, heerlijke
rijstpap? En gij, waar zijt gij, mijn vrouwtje?
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--De assche van Klaas klopt op mijn hert en drijft mij ten
strijde. Maar gij, zachtmoedige Lamme, die den dood van uwen vader
noch uwe moeder moet wreken, noch het verdriet van hen die gij bemint,
nog uw huidige armoede, laat mij alleen gaan, daar waar de plicht
mij roept, zoo de vermoeienissen des oorlogs u afschrikken.
--Alleen? sprak Lamme.
En hij hield zijn ezel in, die dezen stilstand ten nutte maakte om
zich deugd te doen aan de distelen, waarmede de weg vol stond, zoo
ver het oog reikte. Uilenspiegel's grauwtje bleef insgelijks staan
en nam deel aan 't ezelsfestijn.
--Alleen? sprak Lamme. Dát zult gij niet doen; mij alleen laten
ware een groote wreedheid. Alreeds mijne vrouw kwijt, en vervolgens
mijn vriend, dat ware te veel. Ik zal nooit meer klagen, ik beloof
het u. En, als het nu toch moet zijn,--en hij hief kloekmoedig het
hoofd op,--zal ik gaan onder den kogelregen, ja! En in 't midden
der zweerden, ja! vlak in 't gezicht van die leelijke huurlingen,
die bloed zuipen lijk wolven. En mocht ik eens doodelijk getroffen
aan uwe voeten neervallen, begraaf mij dan, mijn vriend Uilenspiegel,
en ziet gij later mijne vrouw weer, zeg heur dat ik gestorven ben,
omdat ik niet leven kon zonder door iemand bemind te wezen.... Neen,
dat zou ik niet kunnen, mijn vriend.
En Lamme weende, en Uilenspiegel voelde een krop in de keel.
XXVII.
In dien tijd verdeelde de hertog zijn leger in twee afdeelingen:
het eerste korps zond hij naar het hertogdom Luxemburg, het ander
naar het markgraafschap Namen.
--Dat is eene krijgsbeweging waarvan ik de reden niet gis, sprak
Uilenspiegel, maar 't is mij eender, laat ons vol vertrouwen naar
Maastricht gaan.
Toen zij omtrent de stede langsheen de Maas reden, zag Lamme dat
Uilenspiegel aandachtig al de booten bezag, die op den stroom vaarden,
en dat hij eindelijk bleef staan voor eene, met een gebeeldhouwde
meermin op den achtersteven. En die meermin hield een schild vast,
waarop, met gouden letteren op een zwart veld, het teeken I-H-S stond,
het teeken dat Onzen Heer Jezus-Christus bediedt.
Uilenspiegel deed teeken tot Lamme om stil te staan, en hij begon
blijgemoed te fluiten als de leeuwerik.
Op de boot kwam een man voor, die kraaide als een haan, vervolgens,
toen Uilenspiegel balkte als een ezel en naar het volk wees dat
op de kaai bijeengehoopt stond, insgelijks verschrikkelijk begon
te balken. Op dat geluid spitsten de beide ezelen van Lamme en
Uilenspiegel de ooren en vergezelden zij 't refrein in hunne
moedertaal.
Vrouwlieden trokken voorbij en ook mannen die met jaagpeerden opgingen,
en Uilenspiegel zei tot Lamme.
--Die schipper spot met ons en met onze ezelen. Als wij hem eens eene
rammeling gaven op zijne boot? Wat dunkt u er van?
--Dat hij liever hier kome, zoo hij durft, antwoordde Lamme.
Toen sprak eene vrouw:
--Als gij niet wilt voortgaan met uwe armen af, uwe ribben gebroken,
uwen snoet aan stukken, laat Sterke Pier dan maar balken zooveel het
hem lust.
--Hi han! hi han! hi han! balkte de schipper.
--Laat hem maar roepen, zei de vrouw, verleden week zagen wij hem
eene kar, beladen met zware tonnen bier, op de schouderen nemen,
en een andere kar inhouden, waarvoor een sterk Vlaamsch peerd was
gespannen. Dáár, sprak zij, naar eene afspanning wijzend, daar in
den Blauwen Toren, smeet hij, op twintig stappen afstand, zijn mes
door een eiken berd van twaalf duim dik.
--Hi han! hi han! ging de schipper voort, terwijl een jongetje
van twaalf jaar op het dek van het schip klom en insgelijks begon
te balken.
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Uw Sterke Pier kan ons weinig schelen! Hij mag zoo sterk zijn als
hij wil, wij zijn sterker dan hij, en mijn vriend Lamme hier, zou er
twee van zijne dikte binnenspelen, zonder hikken of blazen.
--Wat zegt gij, mijn jongen? vroeg Lamme.
--De waarheid, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, gij moet niet loochenen
uit zedigheid.
En tot de vergaderde menigte vervolgde hij:
--Ja, goede mannen, vrouwen en arbeiders, straks zult gij hem zien
te werk gaan met de vuisten en dien fameuzen Sterken Pier met zijnen
neus in het stof duwen.
--Zwijg toch, zei Lamme.
--Uwe kracht is gekend, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, gij moet niet
loochenen.
--Hi han! riep de schipper.
--Hi han! kefte het jongetje.
Plotseling floot Uilenspiegel opnieuw, welluidend als een kweelende
leeuwerik.
En de verrukte mannen, vrouwen en arbeiders vroegen hem waar hij dat
goddelijk vogelgezang had geleerd.
--In het hemelrijk, van waar ik kom, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
Vervolgens sprak hij tot den schipper, die niet ophield met balken
en spottend met de vingeren naar hem te wijzen:
--Waarom blijft gij daar op uwe boot, nietdeug? Durft gij aan wal
komen om met ons en onze ezels te spotten?
--Ja, durft gij? vroeg Lamme.
--Hi han! hi han! hi han! ging de schipper maar voort. Heeren
langooren, ik noodig u op mijne boot.
--Doe maar altijd lijk ik, zei Uilenspiegel stille tot Lamme. En den
schipper riep hij toe:
--Zijt gij Sterke Pier, ik, ik ben Thijl Uilenspiegel. En onze
ezelen, Jef en Jan, kunnen beter balken dan gij, want balken is hunne
moedertaal. Maar op uwe slecht gevoegde berden komen, daarvoor zullen
wij ons wachten. Uwe boot lijkt niet slecht op eene kuip; als een
golfslag haar voortstoot, wijkt zij weer achteruit, en zij kan maar
vooruit lijk de krabben, zijwaarts.
--Ja, lijk de krabben! riep Lamme achterna.
Toen sprak de schipper tot Lamme:
--Wat mompelt gij daar onverstaanbaar tusschen uwe tanden, spekblok?
Lamme, die kwaad werd, riep:
--Slechte christen, die mij mijn gebrek verwijt, weet dat mijn vet
mijn eigendom is en van voedzame spijzen voortkomt, terwijl gij,
oude, roestige nagel, van niets anders leeft dan van uitgemergelde
haringen, van keerswieken, van stokvischvellen, te oordeelen naar uw
magere beenen, die door uw gescheurde hooze steken.
--Die gaan malkander in 't haar vliegen, zeiden de omstanders, vol
ongeduldig genoegen.
--Hi han! hi han! riep de schipper.
Lamme wilde van zijnen ezel stijgen, om steenen op te rapen en naar
den schipper te werpen.
--Met geen steenen smijten, zeide Uilenspiegel.
De schipper zeide iets in 't oor van het jongetje, dat naast hem op
de boot aan 't hihannen was.
Het knaapje maakte een schuitje los, dat aan de boot vastgemeerd
was en bereikte den oever, door middel van eenen haak, dien hij zeer
behendig hanteerde.
Toen hij dicht bij den wal was, riep hij, fier met het hoofd omhoog:
--De komplimenten van mijnen baas en hij vraagt of gij op zijne boot
durft komen om tegen hem te vechten met vuisten en voeten. Die mannen
en vrouwlieden zullen getuigen zijn.
--Zeker, durven wij, zeide Uilenspiegel op waardige wijze.
--Wij nemen het gevecht aan, zeide op zijne beurt Lamme, op
hoogmoedigen toon.
Het was om den middag; de handwerkslieden, dijkwerkers, kasseiers,
scheepmakers, de vrouwen met het middageten van heure mannen, de
kinderen die op hunne vaders stonden te zien, dewelke boonen aten met
gekookt vleesch, allen lachten, klapten in de handen bij de gedachte
aan een nakend gevecht en hoopten, met onverholen blijdschap, dat een
der strijders zijn kop zou ingeslagen worden, of deerlijk gehavend
in de vaart zou vliegen, tot groot genoegen van elkeen.
--Mijn jongen, zei Lamme, die minder strijdlustig werd, hij gaat ons in
't water smijten.
--Wel, laat er u in smijten, sprak Uilenspiegel.
--De dikzak wordt benauwd, zei de menigte werklieden en vrouwen
en kinderen.
Lamme, altijd op zijnen ezel gezeten, keerde zich naar hen toe en
bekeek ze grammoedig, maar zij jouwden hem uit.
--Laat ons op de boot gaan, zei Lamme tot Uilenspiegel, zij zullen
eens zien of ik benauwd ben!
Op die woorden werd hij opnieuw uitgejouwd en Uilenspiegel sprak:
--Laat ons op de boot gaan.
Toen zij van hunne ezels gestegen waren, wierpen zij de teugels naar
het jongetje, hetwelk de grauwtjes vriendelijk streelde en naar eene
plaats leidde, waar distelen groeiden.
Vervolgens nam Uilenspiegel een riem, deed Lamme in het schuitje plaats
nemen, wrikte naar de boot, en klom er op door middel eener koord.
Lamme, zweetend en blazend, volgde hem en klaverde achter hem op
de boot.
Toen Uilenspiegel op het dek van de bark stond, boog hij zich voorover,
alsof hij zijne schoenen wilde toerijgen, en zeide hij eenige woorden
tot den schipper, die glimlachte en pinkoogde, terwijl hij naar
Lamme keek.
Vervolgens zond hij hem allerlei scheldwoorden naar het hoofd, hiet
hem deugniet, galgenaas, gevangenisgebroed, papeter, vetbol, en zei:
--Dikke walvisch, hoeveel tonnen traan levert gij wel, als men u
eenen steek in den buik geeft?
Lamme antwoordde niet, doch vloog eensklaps naar hem als een razende
stier, wierp hem ten gronde en sloeg op hem uit al zijne macht, doch
hij deed hem niet veel zeer, omdat er niet veel kracht in zijne vette
armen stak.
De schipper gebaarde dat hij zich verweerde, doch liet hem begaan en
Uilenspiegel zei op snoevenden toon:
--Die nietdeug kan maar zien, dat hij ons te drinken betaalt.
De mannen, vrouwlieden, arbeiders, die van den oever het gevecht
nagingen, zeiden:
--Wie had gedacht dat die dikzak zooveel kracht had?
En zij klapten in de handen, terwijl Lamme sloeg gelijk de duivel op
Geeraard. Maar de schipper nam geen andere voorzorg dan zijn aangezicht
te beschutten.
Eensklaps zag men Lamme, met zijne knie op de borst van Sterken Pier,
met eene hand hem bij de keel houdend en met de andere omhoog, gereed
om te slaan.
--Vraag om genade, schreeuwde hij razend, of ik stoot u dwars door
de berden uwer modderschuit.
De schipper kuchte, om te bedieden, dat hij niet kon spreken, en deed
teeken met de hand dat hij om genade vroeg.
Lamme hielp grootmoedig zijnen vijand opstaan en, met den rug naar
de toeschouwers, stak hij zijne tong uit naar Uilenspiegel, die in
een schaterlach uitberstte, toen hij Lamme, met het hoofd omhoog,
triomfantelijk met groote stappen op de boot zag over en weer loopen.
En de mannen, vrouwlieden, knapen en meidekens, die op den oever
stonden, juichten toe om het meest en riepen:
--Leve de overwinnaar van Sterken Pier! 't Is een ijzeren man!
En tot elkander zeiden zij:
--Hebt gij hem zien slaan met de vuist? Ja, en met een stoot met het
hoofd smeet hij den andere ten gronde. Nu gaan zij drinken om pais
te maken. Sterke Pier komt boven met wijn en met worsten.
Inderdaad, Sterke Pier was twee kroezen en een groote pint witten
wijn van de Maas gaan halen. En Lamme en hij gaven elkander de hand
tot teeken van vrede.
En Lamme, die als in den hemel was, ter wille van zijne zegepraal en
ook om den wijn en de worsten, vroeg hem, wijzend naar een groote
schouw waaruit een zwarte, dikke rook opsteeg, wat voor stoverije
hij maakte in het ruim.
--'t Is oorlogskeuken, antwoordde Sterke Pier met een glimlach.
De menigte werklieden, vrouwen en kinderen was uiteengegaan om
zich naar den arbeid of naar huis te begeven, en van mond tot mond
verspreidde zich het gerucht dat een dik man, op eenen ezel gezeten
en vergezeld van een kleinen pelgrim, sterker dan Samson was en dat
men zich wachten moest hem scheef te bezien.
Lamme at en dronk, en bezag zegevierend den schipper.
Deze zeide eensklaps:
--Uwe ezelen vervelen zich ginder.
Daarop bracht hij de boot tegen de kaai, ging aan wal, nam een der
ezelen bij de voorpooten en de achterpooten en, het dier dragende
gelijk het kindeken Jezus het lammeken droeg, zette hij het neer op
het dek van de boot.
Vervolgens deed hij, zonder hijgen, hetzelfde met den anderen ezel,
waarna hij zeide:
--Laat ons drinken!
Het jongetje sprong op het dek.
En zij dronken.
Lamme stond verstomd; hij wist niet goed of hij het wel was, geboortig
uit Damme, welke dien sterken, gespierden man afgerost had, en dorst
hem nog slechts ter sluips bezien en zonder den minsten hoogmoed,
want hij vreesde dat de schipper lust kreeg hem op te pakken gelijk
hij de ezelen opgenomen had, en hem levend in de Maas te smijten,
uit weerwraak.
Maar glimlachend noodde de schipper hem nogmaals tot drinken, en Lamme
herstelde zich van zijne vrees en bezag hem opnieuw met zegevierend
zelfvertrouwen.
En de schipper en Uilenspiegel bekeken elkander en schoten in een
luiden schaterlach.
Intusschen hadden de ezelen, verwonderd zich op een plankenvloer
te gevoelen (iets aan hetwelk zij geenszins gewend waren) den kop
gebogen en de ooren gestreken; zij dorsten niet drinken van schrik.
De schipper ging een van de maatjes haver halen, welke hij gaf aan
de peerden die zijne boot voorttrokken, want hij kocht zijne haver
zelf, om door de voerlieden niet bestolen te worden op den prijs van
het voeder.
Toen de ezelen het maatje haver zagen, prevelden zij binnensmonds
paternosters van vraatzucht, terwijl zij weemoedig den vloer van de
boot bekeken, want uit vreeze van uit te glijden, dorsten zij geen
stap verzetten.
Daarop zei de schipper tot Uilenspiegel en tot zijnen vriend Lamme
Goedzak:
--Laat ons naar de keuken gaan.
--'t Is oorlogskeuken, zei Lamme ongerust.
--Ja, 't is oorlogskeuken, maar zonder vrees moogt gij beneden komen,
mijn overwinnaar.
--Ik ben niet bevreesd, sprak Lamme, en ten blijke daarvan zal ik
u volgen.
Het jongetje ging naar het roer.
Toen zij beneden kwamen, zagen zij overal zakken graan, boonen,
erwten, kool, wortelen en andere groenten.
De schipper opende de deur eener smidse en zei:
--Vermits gij mannen zijt met kloekmoedig hert, die het gezang kent
van den leeuwerik, die het zinnebeeld der vrijheid is, en het dappere
gekraai van den haan, en 't gebalk van den ezel, dien zachtmoedigen
werker, wil ik u mijne oorlogskeuken toonen. Deze kleine smidse vindt
men in de meeste booten, die op de Maas varen. Ze kan niet verdacht
voorkomen, want zij dient om het ijzerwerk aan boord te herstellen;
doch alle schepen hebben den schoonen voorraad niet, die steekt in
deze kasten.
Toen schoof hij eenige steenen weg, die het onderste scheepsruim
bedekten; hij hief eenige planken op en haalde er een dikken bundel
geweerloopen uit, stak dien omhoog als een pluimken en legde hem toen
weder op zijne plaats.
Vervolgens toonde hij hun lanspunten, hellebaardijzers, zweerdklingen,
zakjes kogels en kruit.
--Leve de geus! sprak hij, hier zijn de boonen en de saus; de kolven
zijn de bouten, de hellebaardijzers zijn de salade, en die geweerloopen
de osseschinkels voor de vrijheidssoep!
... Leve de Geus! Waar moet ik al die spijzen brengen? vroeg hij
aan Uilenspiegel.
Deze antwoordde:
--Naar Nijmegen, waar gij zult binnenvaren met uwe boot nog zwaarder
beladen met echte groenten, die de boeren u brengen te Elsen,
te Stevensweert en te Roermond. En die ook zullen zingen lijk de
leeuwerik, zinnebeeld der vrije mannen, en gij zult ook antwoorden met
een dapper hanengekraai. Gij zult bij dokter Pontus gaan, die omtrent
de Nieuwe Waal woont, hem zeggen, dat gij in de stad komt met groenten,
doch dat gij droogte vreest. Terwijl de boeren met de groenten naar de
markt gaan en ze zoo duur zullen te koop stellen dat niemand ze koopen
wil, zal dokter Pontus u zeggen wat gij met uwe lading wapenen doen
moet. Maar ik denk dat hij u eene zending zal opleggen die niet zonder
gevaar is, en u bevelen de Waal, de Maas of den Rijn af te varen, uwe
groenten te ruilen tegen netten en naar de visschersschuiten te gaan
te Harlingen, alwaar vele matrozen het gezang des leeuweriks kennen,
vervolgens door de wadden, langsheen de kust, naar de Lauwerzee
te varen, de netten te ruilen tegen ijzer en lood, aan uwe boeren
kleederen te geven naar de dracht van de eilanden Marken, Vlieland
of Ameland, een weinig van de kust af te blijven, te visschen en uwe
vangst in te zouten, niet om ze te verkoopen, doch om ze te bewaren,
want zout eten en een goeden pot drinken is geoorloofd in oorlogstijd.
--Als het zoo is, sprak de schipper, laat ons drinken!
En zij gingen terug naar het dek.
Doch Lamme was vol weemoed.
--Mijnheer de schipper, sprak hij, gij hebt daar in uwe smidse een zoo
blakerend vuurtje, dat men daar voorzeker den smakelijksten hutsepot
zou koken, dien men droomen kan. Mijn keelgat smeekt luide om soep.
--Ik zal u ververschen, sprak de man.
En weldra bracht hij een vette soep op, waarin een dikke snee gezouten
hesp was gekookt.
Als Lamme eenige lepelen gegeten had, wendde hij zich naar den schipper
en sprak:
--Mijne keel is verschroeid, mijne tong brandt af; dat is geen
hutsepot dàt.
--Zout eten en dapper drinken is geoorloofd in oorlogstijd, zoo staat
er geschreven, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
De schipper vulde de bekers en sprak:
--Ik drink op den leeuwerik, het zinnebeeld der vrijheid!
Uilenspiegel sprak:
--Ik drink op den haan, die oorlog kraait!
Lamme sprak:
--Ik drink op de gezondheid mijner vrouw; mocht dorst de welbeminde
nooit kwellen!
--Gij gaat langs de Noordzee naar Emden, zei Uilenspiegel tot den
schipper. Emden is eene schuilplaats voor ons.
--De zee is groot, sprak de schipper.
--Groot voor 't gevecht, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--God is met ons, zei de schipper.
--Wie dan kan tegen ons zijn? hernam Uilenspiegel.
--Wanneer vertrekt gij? vroeg Sterke Pier.
--Dadelijk, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Goede reis en den wind van achteren. Neem dit kruit en deze kogelen.
De schipper gaf hun den afscheidskus en deed hun uitgeleide, nadat hij
de beide ezelen als lammekens op zijne schouders aan wal had gebracht.
Lamme en Uilenspiegel stegen op hunne grauwtjes en begaven zich op weg.
Zij reden naar Luik.
--Mijn jongen, vroeg Lamme onderwege aan Uilenspiegel, hoe is het
mogelijk, dat een zoo sterke gespierde kerel zich zoo wreedelijk liet
afrossen door iemand lijk ik?
--Dit deed hij, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, opdat de vreeze u zou
voorafgaan in alle oorden, waarheen wij ons zullen begeven. Dat is
een veiliger geleide dan twintig landsknechten te zamen. Wie dan zou
voortaan nog een minachtend woord durven richten tot Lamme den sterke,
tot den zegevierenden Lamme; tot Lamme den stier, die zijn gelijken
niet heeft, die, onder eens iegelijks oogen, met eenen stoot met
den kop, Sterken Pier nedervelde, Sterken Pier, die ezelen op zijne
schouderen draagt alsof het lammekens waren en geheele bierwagens
opheft? Iedereen kent u hier reeds. Gij zijt de geduchte Lamme,
de onoverwinbare Lamme, en in de schaduw uwer bescherming, rijd ik
onbevreesd door. Op den weg, dien wij zullen volgen, zal iedereen
u kennen, niemand zal zich durven vermeten u scheef te bezien en,
gezien de lafheid der mannen, zult gij nergens op uwen weg iets
anders aantreffen dan nederige buigingen, groeten, loftuitingen en de
algemeene achting, ter eere van de spierkracht uwer geduchte vuisten.
--Gij spreekt goed, mijn jongen, zeide Lamme, die zich stijf in den
zadel hield.
--En ik spreek waarheid, ging Uilenspiegel voort. Ziet gij die
nieuwsgierige gezichten aan de eerste huizen van het dorp? Men toont
elkander Lamme, den schrikverwekkenden overwinnaar. Ziet gij die
mannen u bekijken met afgunst, en die lafhertige weekelingen hunne
muts afnemen voor u? Beantwoord hunne groeten, Lamme; veracht nooit
het zwak van het volk. Zie, de kinderen kennen uwen naam en herhalen
hem met schrik en met eerbied.
En Lamme reed fier voorbij, groette rechts, groette links, als een
koning. En de mare zijner dapperheid ging hem vooraf van dorp tot dorp,
van stad tot stad, tot Luik, Chokier, la Neuville, Vezin en Namen,
welke stad zij lieten liggen, ter oorzake van de drie predikanten.
En aldus reden zij langen tijd voort, langs rivieren, stroomen en
vaarten. En overal werd het gezang van den leeuwerik beantwoord door
't gekraai van den haan.
En overal werden, voor 't werk van de vrijheid, wapenen gegoten,
gesmeed, geslepen, en vervolgens verscheept.
En in tonnen, in kisten, in manden, geraakten zij door, aan de tollen.
En overal werden goede lieden gevonden, die ze wilden aanveerden en
in verzekerde plaatsen bergen, met het kruit en de kogels, totdat
Gods ure zou slaan.
En Lamme reed steeds voort met Uilenspiegel, altijd voorafgegaan
door zijnen roem van onoverwinbaren vuistvechter, tot dusverre dat
hij zelf aan zijn groote kracht begon te gelooven en, hoogmoedig en
strijdlustig geworden, zijnen baard liet groeien.
En Uilenspiegel noemde hem: Lamme de Leeuw.
Doch Lamme bleef niet standvastig in zijn voornemen, want den vierden
dag begon zijn baard hem onuitstaanbaar te steken.
En hij liet het scheermes over zijn zegevierend gezicht strijken, dat
nu weder te voorschijn kwam als de volle maan, met een rooden blos,
gestoofd door het lekkere eten.
Aldus kwamen zij te Stokhem.
XXVIII.
Te Stokhem lieten zij hunne ezelen op stal, en begaven zij zich te
voet naar Antwerpen, welke stede zij bij 't vallen van den avond
binnentrokken.
En Uilenspiegel zeide tot Lamme:
--Hier is de groote stad, de gansche wereld stapelt hier hare
rijkdommen: goud, zilver, specerijen, goudleder, kostelijke tapijten,
lakens, fluweelen, tieretijnen, wollen en zijden stoffen; boonen,
erwten, granen, vleesch en meel, gezouten huiden; wijn van Leuven, van
Namen, van Luxemburg, van Luik, landwijn van Brussel en van Aarschot,
wijn van Buley, uit den wijngaard omtrent de poort van La Plante,
te Namen, Rijnwijn, heerlijke Spaansche- en Portugeesche wijnen;
druivenolie van Aarschot, die zij Landolium heeten; Bourgondische,
Malvezij- en vele andere wijnen. En de kaaien staan vol koopwaren.
... Die rijkdommen der aarde en der menschelijke bedrijvigheid trekken
naar dit oord de schoonste meidekens van de wereld.
--Ik geloof, dat gij weer aan 't droomen zijt, sprak Lamme.
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Onder haar zal ik de Zeven vinden. Er werd mij gezegd:
    In den dood en in het bloed,
    In de puinen en de tranen,
        Vind de Zeven.
... Wie dan veroorzaakt meer verderf dan de meisjes van plezier? Is
het niet bij heur dat de arme, waanzinnige mannen hunne schoone,
klinkende en blinkende karolussen verteren? Laten zij niet bij heur,
juweelen, ringen en kettingen; keeren zij niet uitgeschud huiswaarts,
zonder wambuis en soms zonder hemde, terwijl de deernen smeren en teren
met het geld, dat zij hun ontfutseld hebben? Waar is het roode, heldere
bloed, dat in hunne aderen vloeide? Het is preisap geworden. En vechten
de mannen niet tegen elkander met messen, met daggen, met zweerden, tot
den dood, om heure gunst te verkrijgen? De bleeke en bloedende lijken,
die men wegbrengt, zijn lijken van arme, waanzinnige verliefden. Als
de vader knort en gestreng blijft zitten, als zijn witte haren er
witter en stijver uitzien, als uit zijne droge oogen, die branden van
verdriet over het verderf van zijn kind, geene tranen meer vloeien;
als de moeder, stilzwijgend en bleek als de dood, weent alsof voor
haar de wereld nog slechts wee en ramp moest baren, wie dan is de
schuld van dat verdriet, van die tranen? De lustige meidekens beminnen
niemand dan zich zelven en het geld, en heel de denkende, werkende,
zwoegende wereld houden zij aan heure rokken gebonden. Ja, Lamme,
dáár zijn de Zeven, en wij zullen bij de meidekens gaan. Wellicht
vinden wij daar uwe vrouw: zóó vangen wij twee vliegen in één slag.
--Ik wil wel, sprak Lamme.
Toen was men in de hooimaand, in het midden van den zomer, als de zon
de bladeren der kastanjeboomen roostert, de vogeltjes in het loover
kweelen en de insecten van genoegen gonzen, omdat het gras zoo warm is.
Lamme doolde met gebogen hoofde naast Uilenspiegel door de straten
van Antwerpen; hij sleepte zijn lichaam voort, alsof het zwaar als
een huis was.
--Lamme, sprak Uilenspiegel, gij ziet er wederom zoo weemoedig uit;
weet gij dan niet dat niets slechter kan zijn voor uw vel? Als gij
volherdt in uw zwarte gedachten, zult gij het verliezen met stukken
en brokken. En dan zal het aangenaam zijn te moeten hooren, als men
van u zal spreken: de schurftige Lamme.
--Ik heb honger, sprak Lamme.
--Kom eten, zei Uilenspiegel.
En samen gingen zij naar de Oude Trappen, waar zij soezels aten en
dobbele kuite dronken, totdat zij hunne bekomst hadden.
En Lamme weende niet meer.
En Uilenspiegel sprak:
--Gezegend zij het goed bier, dat de ziel verkwikt als een dartele
zonnestraal. Gij lacht dat uw buik er van schokt. Zoo zie ik u geerne,
met uwe darmen, die dansen van vreugde.
--Mijn vriend, antwoordde Lamme, zij zouden nog meer dansen, zoo ik
het geluk had mijne vrouw weder te vinden.
--Wij zullen ze zoeken, zei Uilenspiegel.
En zoo kwamen zij in de wijk van het Scheld.
--Kijk, zeide Uilenspiegel tot Lamme, kijk naar dit huisje, dat
heel van hout is gemaakt, met schoone, gebeitelde vensteren, waar
kleine ruitjes in steken; kijk naar die gele gordijntjes en die roode
lanteerne. Daar, mijn vriend, achter vier tonnen bruinbier, uitzet,
dobbele kuite en Spaanschen wijn, troont een schoone bazinne van over
de vijftig. Elk jaar, dat de Heer heur vergunt, krijgt zij een nieuwe
laag vet. Op eene der tonnen flikkert eene vetkeers en aan de balken
der zoldering hangt eene lanteerne. Het is daar donker en klaar:
donker voor de liefde en klaar voor 't gelag.
--Maar, sprak Lamme, 't is een klooster van duivelsche nonnen, en
uwe bazinne is de abdis.
--Ja, sprak Uilenspiegel, zij is het, die, in naam van den heer
Beëlzebub, vijftien liederlijke meidekens leidt op den weg van den
ontucht, en de meidekens vinden eten en schuilplaats bij heur, doch
mogen er niet vernachten.
--Kent gij dat huis? vroeg Lamme.
--Neen.
--Hoe kunt gij er dan van spreken?
--Ik ga er uwe vrouw zoeken. Kom mede met mij.
--Neen, sprak Lamme, ik heb mij bepeinsd en ga daar niet binnen.
--Zoudt gij uwen vriend alleen blootgesteld laten aan de ondernemingen
van die dienaressen van Astarte?
--Hij moet er maar niet heen gaan, antwoordde Lamme.
--Als hij er nu moet gaan om de Zeven en meteen uwe vrouw te
zoeken? hernam Uilenspiegel.
--Ik ging liever slapen, sprak Lamme.
--Kom maar mee, zeide Uilenspiegel.
En hij opende de deur en duwde Lamme vóór zich binnen.
--Zie, sprak hij, daar is de bazinne achter heure tonnen, tusschen twee
keersen: de zaal is groot, met heure zwart geworden eiken zoldering
van bewalmde kepers en planken. Rondom, langsheen de muren, staan
stoelen en hinkende tafelen, dewelke bedekt zijn met glazen, pinten,
bekers, kroezen, kruiken, flesschen, bottels en ander drinkgerief. In
't midden der zaal staan nog tafelen en stoelen, waarop huiken, dat
zijn vrouwenkappen, gulden gordelriemen, fluweelen steltschoenen,
doedelzakken, pijpen en schalmeien liggen. In den hoek is eene ladder,
die naar boven leidt. Een kale bultenaar speelt op eene klavecimbel,
die op glazen pooten staat, om 't geluid van het speeltuig te
vermeerderen. Dans, dikzak. Vijftien schoone meiden zitten op tafelen
of schrijlings op stoelen, in allerlei houding: gebogen, op de zijde
geleund of achterover, of met het hoofd in de hand, naarvolgens
heure grillen; ze zijn gekleed in het wit, in het rood, in allerhande
kleuren, en laten heure bloote armen zien en ook een deel van heuren
boezem. Er zijn er van alle soorten; ze zijn uitgekozen! Van de eenen,
laat het weifelend licht der keersen, dat heure blonde lokken komt
streelen, hare blauwe oogen in het duister, zoodat men er enkel het
vochtige vuur in ziet flikkeren. Anderen zien naar de zoldering en
neuren, op de maat van den vedel, een droeve Duitsche ballade. Anderen
nog, ronde, bruine, dikke, drinken met volle bekers Spaanschen wijn en
toonen heure ronde, tot de schouderen ontbloote armen, en schaamteloos
roepen en tieren de eenen na den anderen en allen te zamen. Hoor wat
ze zeggen: Het is onze mesdag! Heden willen wij niets verdienen! Heden
willen wij geen geld: wij vragen slechts liefde!
Toen Lamme zoovele blonde en bruine, frissche en verslenste vrouwen
te gelijk zag, werd hij beschaamd; hij sloeg zijn oogen neder en riep:
--Uilenspiegel, waar zijt gij?
--Hij heeft dit tranendal verlaten, mijn vriend, sprak een dikke
deerne, die hem bij den arm vatte.
--Dit tranendal verlaten? vroeg Lamme.
--Ja, zeide zij, driehonderd jaar geleden, in gezelschap van Jacobus
de Coster van Maerlandt.
--Laat mij los, sprak Lamme, en nijp mij niet meer.
En op droeven toon ging hij voort:
--Uilenspiegel, mijn vriend, waar zijt gij? Kom uwen gezel toch
ter hulp.
Maar de vrouwen sarden hem meer en meer.
--Ik ga dadelijk heen, als gij mij niet gerust laat.
--Gij zult niet vertrekken, zeiden zij.
--Uilenspiegel, ging Lamme jammerend voort, waar zijt gij dan toch?
En zich tot de plaagzieke meiden wendend, ging hij voort:
--Juffer, als 't u belieft, trek mij zoo bij mijn haar niet; het is
geene pruik, ik mag het u verzekeren. Hulp! Hulp! Vindt gij mijne ooren
niet rood genoeg, dat gij ze nijpt en er het bloed in doet stijgen? En
die andere, die mij gedurig knippen voor den neus geeft! Gij doet mij
zeer. Laas! wat wrijft gij nu in mijn aangezicht? Een spiegel! Ik
zie zwart als een ovengat. Als gij niet uitscheidt, maak ik mij
kwaad; gij moest beschaamd zijn een armen, weerloozen man aldus te
mishandelen! Laat mij los! Als gij mij eene uur bij mijne hooze, bij
mijn wambuis, rechts, links, langs alle kanten zult gesleurd hebben,
zult gij er vetter om zijn? Ja, ge moogt er zeker van wezen, ik ga
mij kwaad maken.
--Hij gaat zich kwaad maken, zeiden zij spottend; hij gaat zich kwaad
maken, zou men niet zeggen! Lach liever, en zing ons een liedeken
van zoete minne.
--Ik zal een liedeken zingen van slagen, als gij wilt. Maar nog eens,
laat mij los.
--Wie van ons ziet gij 't liefst?
--Niemand; noch u, noch eene van de anderen. Ik ga mijne klacht doen
bij den magistraat, en hij zal u doen geeselen.
--Hallo, spraken zij, doen geeselen? En zoo wij u vóór de geeseling
eens vastnamen en kusten?
--Mij? sprak Lamme.
--Ja, u! antwoordden allen.
En al de vrouwen, schoone en leelijke, frissche en verslenste, bruine
en blonde, vlogen naar Lamme.
Zij smeten zijne toque, zijn opperste kleed omhoog, streelden hem,
kusten hem, zoenden hem uit al heure kracht, daar waar zij konden,
op zijne kaken, op zijnen neus, op zijne maag, in zijnen hals.
De bazinne schaterlachte tusschen heure vetkeersen.
--Hulp! schreeuwde Lamme, hulp! Uilenspiegel, verlos mij van dat
ongedierte. Laat me los, ik wil van uwe kussen niet weten; ik ben
getrouwd, drommels!, en bewaar al mijne kussen voor mijne vrouw.
--Getrouwd, spraken zij, maar daar heeft uwe vrouw veel te veel aan,
aan een man zoo vollijvig als gij. Geef ons wat van uw vet. Een trouwe
vrouw, dat is van doen, doch een trouwe man is een kapoen. God hoede u:
gij moet eene keus doen, of wij geeselen u, op onze beurt.
--Ik zal het niet doen, sprak Lamme.
--Kies eene uit, spraken zij.
--Neen, sprak hij.
--Wilt gij mij? vroeg een schoone blonde; bezie mij, ik ben zachtzinnig
van aard, en ik min hem, die mij mint.
--Laat mij los, sprak Lamme.
--Wilt gij mij? sprak een bekoorlijke meid, met gitzwarte lokken en
een bruine tint, en die overigens door de engelen gemaakt scheen.
--Peperkoek lust ik niet, sprak Lamme.
--En mij, zult gij mij niet nemen? vroeg een echte reuzin, met een
voorhoofd, dat schier teenemaal bedekt was met heur haar, met dikke
wenkbrauwen, die samen kwamen, met groote, flikkerende oogen, met
dikke, bloedroode lippen, en ook een rood aangezicht, een rooden hals
en roode schouderen.
--Van gloeiende steenen heb ik schrik, antwoordde Lamme.
--Neem mij, sprak een zestienjarig meideken, met een gezichtje zoo
scherp als dat van een eekhorentje.
--Ik houd niet van notenkrakers, antwoordde Lamme.
--We zullen hem moeten geeselen, zeiden zij. Waarmede? Met schoone
zweepen van droog leder. En dapper geklitskletst! Het hardste vel is
niet bestand tegen lederen roeden. Neemt tien zweepen van karrelieden
en ezeldrijvers, die zijn de beste,
--Hulp! hulp! Uilenspiegel! kreet Lamme.
Doch Uilenspiegel antwoordde niet.
--Gij hebt geen hert, zuchtte Lamme, terwijl hij zijnen vriend
overal zocht.
De zweepen werden aangebracht. Twee van de meidekens begonnen Lamme's
wambuis uit te trekken.
--Eilaas! mijn arm vet, dat ik met zooveel moeite vergaarde, gaan
ze mij ongetwijfeld ontnemen met heur striemende zweepen. Maar,
meedoogenlooze wijvekens, mijn vet kan u tot niets dienen, gij kunt
er niet eens sausen van maken.
Zij antwoordden:
--Wij zullen er keersen van gieten. 't Is toch al iets, klaar te zien,
zonder dat het een oortje moet kosten! Zij, die voortaan zal beweren
dat de keersen uit zweepen voortkomen, zal door een iegelijk aanzien
worden voor een zottinne. Doch wij zullen voor heur aantrekken tot
den dood, en wij zullen meer dan ééne weddenschap winnen. Steekt de
roeden even in den azijn. Doet zijn wambuis uit. Negen uren slaat het
op Sint-Jacobs. Als gij met den laatsten slag geene keus gedaan hebt,
gaan wij er op los!
Sidderend jammerde Lamme:
Hebt genade en medelijden met mij; ik heb mijne arme vrouwe trouw
gezworen en ik zal mijn eed gestand doen, hoewel ze heel slecht deed,
mij te verlaten. Uilenspiegel, help mij, verlos mij, mijn vriend!
Doch Uilenspiegel was te hooren noch te zien.
Lamme zeide tot de deernen:
--Aanschouwt mij, ik lig aan uwe voeten. Ootmoediger kan mijne
houding niet wezen. Bediedt dit niet genoeg dat ik, als heiligen,
uwe bekoorlijkheden vereer? Gelukzalig hij, die niet getrouwd is en
uwe koozerijen mag genieten! Ik twijfel er niet aan, dat gij hemelsche
genoegens doet smaken, maar slaat mij niet, als 't u belieft.
Doch de bazinne, tusschen heure twee keersen gezeten, sprak eensklaps
met donderende en dreigende stemme:
--Vrouwen en meidekens, bij alle duivelen uit de helle zweer ik dat,
bijaldien gij, door lachen en koozerijen, dien man niet dadelijk
tot u krijgt, ik de nachtwacht ga halen en u allen in zijne plaats
doe geeselen. Gij verdient geenszins den naam van dienaressen van de
godin der liefde, zoo gij met uwen mond, uwe handen, uwe vurige oogen
niet bij machte zijt de mannen te verleiden. En om uwe onnoozelheid
wordt gij zonder mededoogen gegeeseld!
Op die rede, begonnen de vrouwen en meidekens te beven en blonk
Lamme's gezicht van vreugde.
--Nu, vrouwtjes, sprak hij schertsend, welke mare brengt gij mede van
het land der striemende zweepen? Ik zal der bazinne de moeite sparen
en zelf om de wacht gaan. Deze zal haren plicht doen en ik wil met
pleizier een handeken toesteken. Alle baten helpen.
Doch een aanvallig meideken van een vijftiental jaren viel op hare
knieën vóór Lamme.
--Heer, sprak zij, gij ziet mij hier wel nederig en gelaten vóór uwe
voeten; doch als gij niemand onzer wilt kiezen, moet ik om uwent wille
gegeeseld worden; is dat rechtveerdig? En de bazinne daar, zal mij in
een leelijken, donkeren kelder steken, onder de Schelde, waar het water
van de muren zijpelt en waar ik slechts roggebrood te eten zal krijgen.
--Zou zij werkelijk om mijnent wille gegeeseld worden, mevrouw de
bazinne? vroeg Lamme onthutst.
De bazinne bevestigde:
--Tot bloedens toe gegeeseld.
Lamme aanschouwde toen het meideken en sprak:
--Gij zijt lief, gij zeit frisch, uw blanke schouderen komen als
rozeblaadjes uit op uw kleed; ik wil niet dat die donzige huid,
onder dewelke zulk jeugdig bloed vloeit, lijde onder de slagen der
zweep; dat die heldere, flikkerende oogen weenen ter oorzake van de
smerte der slagen; dat de wakke killigheid des gevangs dat goddelijk
lichaam doe beven. Dienvolgens heb ik liever u te verkiezen, dan te
weten dat gij om mijnent wille geslagen wordt.
Het meideken leidde hem mede. En zoo zondigde hij, gelijk hij deed
heel zijn leven, uit goedhertigheid.
XXIX.
Uilenspiegel en Lamme stapten op naar Gent en kwamen met de
ochtendschemering omtrent Lokeren.
Frissche, witte dampen zweefden over de weiden.
De beide wandelaars kwamen voorbij eene smidse en Uilenspiegel
schuifelde lijk de leeuwerik, de vogel der vrijheid.
En dadelijk vertoonde zich een man met witte, lange haren, vóór de
deur van de smidse, en terstond bootste hij het dapper gekraai van
den haan na.
Uilenspiegel zeide tot Lamme:
Dat is smid Wasteele, die ploegscharen maakt, het ijzer smeedt als het
warm is om er schoone hekken voor kerkkoren van te verveerdigen, en
zeer dikwijls, 's nachts, wapenen smeedt en slijpt voor de soldaten van
het vrije geweten. Hij is vet noch gezond geworden bij dien dubbelen
arbeid, want hij is bleek als een spook, treurig als een verdoemde,
en zoo mager dat zijne beenderen door zijn vel steken. Hij is nog
niet slapen, zeker heeft hij wederom heel den nacht gewrocht.
--Komt binnen, gij beiden, zeide smid Wasteele, en brengt uwe ezelen
op de meersch, achter het huis.
Toen Uilenspiegel en Lamme dit gedaan hadden, kwamen zij terug in
de smidse en zagen, dat smid Wasteele al de zweerden in den kelder
bracht, die hij binst den nacht geslepen had, en het werk voor zijne
knechts gereedmaakte.
Uilenspiegel met doffe oogen beziende, vroeg hij hem:
--Welk nieuws brengt gij van den Zwijger?
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--De Prins is met zijn leger uit de Nederlanden verjaagd, ter oorzake
van de lafheid zijner huurlingen, die roepen: Geld! Geld! als er
te vechten valt. Met zijn trouwe soldaten en zijn broeder, graaf
Lodewijk, trok hij den koning van Navarra en den hugenoten ter hulp;
van daar toog hij naar Duitschland, naar Dillenburg, alwaar vele
vluchtelingen uit de Nederlanden tot hem kwamen. Gij moet wapenen
zenden en het geld dat gij opgehaald hebt, terwijl wij op zee moeten,
om het werk van vrije mannen te verrichten.
--Ik zal doen wat mij geheeten wordt, sprak smid Wasteele; ik heb
wapenen en negenduizend florijnen. Maar zijt gij hier niet gekomen
op ezelen?
--Ja, zeiden zij.
--En hebt gij, onderwege, gene tijding gehad van drie predikanten,
die gedood, uitgeplunderd en in een hol gesmeten werden op de rotsen
van de Maas?
--Ja, antwoordde Uilenspiegel met de grootste vrijmoedigheid, die
drie predikanten waren spionnen van den hertog, die betaald waren
om den prins in het verderf te brengen. Wij getweeën, Lamme en ik,
hebben hun het tijdelijke met het eeuwige doen verwisselen. Hun geld
is in ons bezit en hunne papieren insgelijks. Wij zullen er van nemen
wat ons hoeft voor onze reis, de rest zullen wij aan den prins geven.
En Uilenspiegel deed zijn wambuis open, alsmede dat van Lamme en trok
er papieren en perkamenten uit.
Smid Wasteele las ze en sprak vervolgens:
--Zij behelzen plannen van gevecht en van samenzweering. Ik zal ze den
prins doen behandigen, en er zal hem gezegd worden, dat Uilenspiegel
en Lamme Goedzak, zijn trouwe wandelaars, zijn edel leven gered
hebben. Ik ga uwe ezelen doen verkoopen, opdat men U niet aan uwe
rijdieren zou herkennen.
Uilenspiegel vroeg aan smid Wasteele of de vierschaar der schepenen
van Namen reeds heure serjanten achter hunne hielen had gezonden.
--Ik ga u kond geven van hetgene ik weet, antwoordde Wasteele. Een smid
van Namen, een dappere en overtuigde hervormde, is laatst hier bij
mij geweest, zoogezeid om mij te vragen hem te helpen in het maken
van de hekken, windwijzers en het ander ijzerwerk voor een slot,
dat men omtrent La Plante aan 't bouwen is. De deurwaarder van de
vierschaar der schepenen heeft hem verteld, dat zijne meesters reeds
bijeengekomen waren, en dat de baas eener taveerne alreeds geroepen
was, omdat hij op eenige honderden stappen van de plaats van den
moord woont. Ondervraagd of hij de moordenaars of hen, die hij van den
moord kon verdenken, gezien had, heeft hij geantwoord: "Ik heb boeren
en boerinnen gezien, die op ezelen reden; sommigen bleven op hunne
dieren zitten en vroegen te drinken aan de deur, anderen stegen van
hunne ezelen en kwamen in de gelagkamer, de manslieden dronken bier, de
vrouwen en meidekens mede. Ik zag ook twee dappere mannen, die spraken
van messire van Oranje een kopken kleiner te maken." Terwijl de baas
dit zeide, floot hij, om den steek van een mes in het vleesch van den
hals na te bootsen. "Bij Stalen Wind, zeide hij, zal ik u heimelijk
op de hoogte houden, daar dit in mijne macht is." Hij sprak en werd
losgelaten. Sedert dien tijd hebben de justitieraden ongetwijfeld
brieven gezonden aan de baljuws. De baas zei, dat hij anders niemand
gezien had dan boeren en boerinnen op ezelen; daaruit is te voorzien,
dat men jacht zal maken op allen die men schrijlings op ezelen zal
aantreffen. En de prins heeft u noodig, mijne kinderen.
--Verkoop onze ezelen, zeide Uilenspiegel, en de opbrengst kunt gij
voegen bij den oorlogsschat van den prins.
De dieren werden verkocht.
--Nu moet gij, sprak Wasteele, elk een vrij ambacht hebben, dat tot
geene gilden behoort. Kunt gij vogelkooien en rattenvallen maken?
--Ik heb er vroeger veel gemaakt, zeide Uilenspiegel.
--En gij? vroeg Wasteele aan Lamme.
--Ik, sprak Lamme, ik zal wafelen en oliekoeken verkoopen.
Volgt mij; hier zijn heel gereedgemaakte vogelkooien en rattenvallen,
met gereedschap en koperdraad om ze te herstellen en er anderen te
maken. Dit alles werd mij gebracht door een mijner spionnen Dat is voor
u, Uilenspiegel. Gij, Lamme, krijgt een klein komfoor met blaasbalg;
ik zal u ook deeg, spek en olie geven, om uwe wafelen en oliekoeken
te bakken.
--Hij is in staat alles zelf op te eten, zei Uilenspiegel.
--Wanneer beginnen wij te bakken? vroeg Lamme.
Wasteele antwoordde:
--Gij zult mij eerst een nacht of twee moeten helpen; alleen kan ik
mijn werk niet afkrijgen.
--Ik heb honger, sprak Lamme, is hier niets te eten?
--Er is brood en kaas, antwoordde Wasteele.
--Zonder boter? vroeg Lamme.
--Zonder boter, sprak Wasteele.
--Hebt gij bier of wijn? vroeg Uilenspiegel.
--Ik zelf drink er nooit, antwoordde Wasteele; doch als gij er hebben
wilt, zal ik er halen in den Pelikaan, hier dichtbij.
--Ja, sprak Lamme, en breng meteen wat hesp mee.
--Ik zal doen wat gij vraagt, sprak Wasteele, die Lamme met groote
verachting bekeek.
Toch bracht hij dobbelen klauwaard en hesp. En, van genoegen, at
Lamme voor vijven.
En hij sprak:
--Wanneer beginnen wij te werken?
--Dezen nacht, sprak Wasteele, maar blijft in de smidse en wees niet
bevreesd voor mijne gasten. Het zijn hervormden lijk gij.
--Dat gaat mij, sprak Lamme.
's Nachts, als de slaapklokken geluid hadden en de poorten gesloten
waren, deed Wasteele zich helpen door Uilenspiegel en Lamme, om uit
den kelder zware pakken wapenen naar zijne werkplaats te dragen.
--Hier zijn, sprak hij, twintig bussen, die moeten hersteld, dertig
lanspunten, die moeten geslepen worden, en lood om vijftienhonderd
kogels te gieten; gij gaat mij helpen.
--Met mijn beide handen! antwoordde Uilenspiegel. Waarom heb ik er
geen vier om u behulpzaam te wezen!
--Lamme zal ons helpen, sprak Wasteele.
--Ja, antwoordde Lamme op jammerlijken toon, want hij viel van den
vaak, ter oorzake van het overvloedig eten en drinken.
--Gij zult het lood gieten, sprak Uilenspiegel.
--Ik zal, sprak Lamme.
Lamme smolt zijn lood en goot zijn kogels, doch grimmig bekeek hij smid
Wasteele, die hem dwong op te blijven, terwijl hij zoo'n slaap had.
Hij goot de kogels, maar hij had grooten lust het gesmolten lood over
het hoofd van smid Wasteele te gieten. Doch hij hield zich in. Rond
middernacht werd hij, oververmoeid, door razernij overvallen en,
terwijl smid Wasteele en Uilenspiegel geduldig zweerden, bussen en
lanspunten slepen, hield hij met sissende stem de volgende rede:
--Daar staat gij nu, mager, bleek en schraal, met uw vast vertrouwen
in de prinsen en in de grooten der aarde; door overdreven ijver,
veronachtzaamt gij uw lichaam, uw edel lichaam, dat gij laat vergaan
van ellende en zelfvernedering. Daarom is het niet, dat de goede
God u schiep. Vergeet niet dat onze ziel, die de adem des levens is,
boonen, ossevleesch, bier, wijn, hesp, worsten, pensen, alsmede rust
noodig heeft tot haar bestaan; gij, gij leeft van brood, water en
slapeloosheid!
--Van waar komt u die ongewone woordenvloed? vroeg Uilenspiegel.
--Hij weet niet wat hij zegt, antwoordde Wasteele schokschouderend.
Maar Lamme vervolgde:
--Ik weet het beter dan gij. Ik zeg dat wij zot zijn, ik, gij en
Uilenspiegel insgelijks, onze oogen te bederven voor al die prinsen
en heeren, die zeker zouden lachen met ons, als zij ons, overvallen
door vermoeienis, den nacht zagen doorbrengen met wapenen te slijpen
en kogels te gieten, te hunnen dienste. Terwijl zij wijn uit gouden
bekers drinken en kapoenen in tinnen schotels eten, vragen zij zich
niet af of hunne vijanden met hunne zeisen onze beenen niet afkappen
en ons in den doodenkuil niet werpen. Intusschen zullen zij, die in
den grond noch hervormden, noch calvinisten, noch lutheranen, noch
katholieken zijn, maar aan God noch duivel gelooven, heerlijkheden
koopen en bemachtigen, het goed van monniken, abten en konventen
inslikken. Alles zal voor hen zijn: en vrouwen en maagden en meidekens;
uit hunne gouden bekers zullen zij drinken op hun eeuwig welzijn,
op onze altijddurende onnoozelheid en op de zeven hoofdzonden, die
zij gedurig bedrijven; ja, smid Wasteele, en dàt onder uwen neus,
die mager is van geestdrift. Aanschouw de velden, de weiden, zie naar
de oogsten, de boomgaarden, de ossen, het goud dat opstijgt uit de
aarde; aanschouw de wilde dieren van de bosschen, de vogelen van de
hemelen, de lekkere ortolanen, de heerlijke lijsters, den kop van
het everzwijn, den bout van den reebok: jacht, vischvangst, aarde,
zee, alles, alles is voor hen! En gij, gij leeft van water en brood,
en wij, wij werken ons dood voor hen, zonder slapen, zonder eten,
zonder drinken! En als wij er onder zullen bezweken zijn, zullen
zij onze lijken uit hunnen weg schoppen en tot onze moeders zeggen:
"Maakt er anderen, deze krengen kunnen ons niet meer dienen."
Uilenspiegel lachte goedmoedig zonder iets te zeggen; Lamme blies
van verontweerdiging, doch Wasteele zeide op zachtmoedigen toon:
--Gij spreekt lichtzinnig. Ik leef niet voor hesp, voor bier, noch
voor ortolanen, maar voor de zegepraal van het vrije geweten. Voor de
vrijheid, doet de prins lijk ik. Hij offert zijn goed, zijne rust,
zijn geluk op om de beulen en de dwingelandij uit de Nederlanden
te verdrijven. Doe lijk hij en tracht mager te worden. Het is niet
met den buik dat men de volkeren redt, maar met fieren moed en met
geduldige vermoeienis. En nu,... ga maar slapen, zoo gij vaak hebt.
Maar Lamme wilde niet slapen gaan, want de smid had hem beschaamd.
En gedrieën slepen zij wapenen en smolten zij kogelen tot den dageraad.
En dit drie nachten achtereen.
Toen vertrokken zij naar Gent. Onderwege leurden zij met vogelkooien,
muizenvallen en oliekoeken.
Zoo kwamen zij te Meulestede, welks roode daken men van verre ontwaart,
en daar kwamen zij overeen dat elk op zijn eigen hand zou rond gaan
en dat men 's avonds, vóór de slaapklok, malkander zou vinden in de
afspanning den Zwaan.
Lamme zwierf door de straten van Gent en verkocht gewetensvol zijne
oliekoeken, want hij kreeg zin in zijn bedrijf, maar toch vergat
hij zijne vrouw niet, want hij zocht ze gedurig, noch zijnen buik,
want hij ledigde menigvuldige pinten en at zonder ophouden.
Uilenspiegel had brieven van den prins van Oranje besteld aan Jacob
Scoelap, licentiaat in de medicijnen, aan Lieven Smet, kleermaker,
aan Jan de Wulfslaeger, aan Gillis Coorne, roodverver, en aan Jan de
Roose, ticheldekkker, welke hem het geld ter hand stelden, dat zij
voor den prins opgehaald hadden, en hem zeiden nog eenige dagen te
Gent en in 't ronde te blijven, daar zij hem nog meer zouden geven.
Die mannen werden later aan de Nieuwe Galge uit hoofde van ketterije
gehangen, en hunne lijken werden begraven op het Galgeveld, omtrent
de Brugsche poort.
XXX.
Doch de provoost, de rosse Spelle, met zijne roode roede gewapend,
reed op zijn mager peerd van de eene naar de andere stad, en overal
deed hij schavotten oprichten, brandstapels aansteken, putten delven
om arme vrouwen en meidekens levend te begraven.
En de koning erfde.
Uilenspiegel zat met Lamme te Meulestede onder eenen boom, en was
naargeestig. Het was killig, niettegenstaande het in de Zomermaand
was. Uit den hemel, vol grijze wolken, viel een fijne hagel.
--Mijn vriend, sprak Lamme, 't is nu de vierde nacht dat gij op den
dril zijt en bij de meidekens loopt. Gij slaapt in den Zoeten Inval;
gij zult eindigen lijk de man van het uithangbord, en met uw hoofd
voorop in een bijenkorf vallen. Tevergeefs zit ik op u te wachten in
den Zwaan, en uw losbandig leven voorspelt niets goeds. Waarom neemt
gij geene vrouw in alle eer en deugd?
--Lamme, sprak Uilenspiegel, hij voor wien ééne allen is, en voor
wien allen ééne zijn, in dien liefelijken strijd die minne heet,
kan zoo lichtzinnig en in der haast geene keus doen.
--En Nele, denkt gij aan heur niet?
--Nele is ver van hier, te Damme, zuchtte Uilenspiegel.
Terwijl hij steeds op de hurken zat en de hagel duchtig nederviel,
liep een jonge, lieftallige vrouw voorbij, die heuren rok over heur
hoofd had geslagen om zich voor den hagel te beschutten.
--He, sprak zij, wat zit gij daar onder dien boom te suffen?
--Ik vraag mij af, sprak Uilenspiegel, of ik ooit eene vrouw zal
vinden, die mij onder het dak van heuren rok zal laten schuilen.
--Gij hebt ze gevonden, sprak de vrouw, sta op.
Uilenspiegel stond recht en ging naar heur toe.
--Gaat gij mij weder alleen laten? vroeg Lamme.
--Ja, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, doch ga naar den Zwaan, en eet daar
eenen bout, eet hesp en al wat u lust, drink er twaalf pinten bier,
en trek vervolgens naar uw bed; zoodoende ben ik van u ontslagen.
--In dien raad steekt iets goeds, zei Lamme.
Doch Uilenspiegel hoorde hem niet en was reeds bij de vrouw.
--Licht mijn rok langs de eenen kant op, sprak zij, ik zal hem langs
den anderen kant optillen.
Toen de rok over hunne hoofden geslagen was, zeide zij:
--Laat ons nu loopen.
--Waarom loopen? vroeg Uilenspiegel.
--Om uit Meulestede te vluchten, sprak zij, de provoost Spelle is
daar met twee beulsknechten en hij heeft gezworen al de onnutte
vrouwen--lijk hij ons heet--te doen geeselen, als zij hem geen vijf
gulden willen betalen. Daarom is 't dat ik loop: kom mede en blijf
bij mij om mij te verdedigen.
--Lamme, riep Uilenspiegel van verre, Spelle is te Meulestede! Ga in
aller ijl naar Destelbergen, in de Drie Koningen.
Verschrikt, sprong Lamme schielijk op. Hij hield zijnen buik met de
beide handen vast en begon te loopen.
--Waar loopt die dikke haas naartoe?
--Naar een hol waar ik hem wel zal terugvinden, antwoordde
Uilenspiegel.
--Laat ons loopen, zeide zij, terwijl zij als een driftige merrie op
den grond stampte.
--Ik zou deugdzaam willen zijn zonder te loopen, antwoordde
Uilenspiegel.
--Wat beteekent dat? vroeg zij.
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Die dikke haas daar wil mij doen verzaken aan den goeden wijn,
aan het gerstesap en aan de donzige huid van de vrouwen.
Wantrouwig bezag hem de meid.
--Gij hebt korten adem, zeide zij, gij zoudt niet slecht doen te
rusten.
--Rusten, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, rusten? Maar ik zie geenerlei
schuilplaats.
--Uwe deugd, antwoordde de deerne, zal u tot dekmantel dienen.
--Ik verkies uwen rok, zeide hij.
--Mijn rok, zeide de deerne, ware onweerdig eenen heilige te dekken,
lijk gij beweert te zijn. Ga weg, ik zal alleen voortloopen.
--Weet gij dan niet, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, dat een hond op zijn
vier pooten sneller loopt dan een mensch op twee? Ziedaar waarom wij,
met vier beenen, sneller zullen loopen.
--Ge spreekt nog al krachtig voor een deugdzaam mensch.
--Ja, zeide hij.
--Maar, sprak zij, ik heb altijd gezien dat de deugd een stille,
ingesluimerde, dikke en kouwelijke hoedanigheid is, een masker, dat
knorrende gezichten verbergt, een fluweelen opperste kleed om een man
van graniet. Ik minne die, in welker borst een mannelijk vuur blakert,
dat tot lustige en dappere ondernemingen aanzet.
--Aldus, zei Uilenspiegel, sprak de schoone duivelin tot den
doorluchtigen, heiligen Antonius.
Twintig stappen verder lag eene afspanning langs den weg.
--Gij hebt goed gesproken, vervolgde Uilenspiegel, nu moet gij goed
drinken.
--Ik heb nog geen dorst, zei de vrouw.
Zij gingen de afspanning binnen.
Op eene schapraai, nevens den schoorsteen, stond eene buikflesch.
Uilenspiegel sprak tot den baas:
--Ziet gij dezen gulden?
--Ik zie hem, zei de baas.
--Hoeveel oortjes zoudt gij er wel van afhouden, om die flesch daar
met dobbelen klauwaard te vullen?
De baas antwoordde:
--Met negen mannekens zijt gij er van af.
--Dat maakt, zei Uilenspiegel, zes mijten Vlaamsch, dus twee mijten
te veel. Om het even, tap ze maar vol.
Uilenspiegel schonk de meid eenen beker vol. Daarop stond hij recht;
met fiere houding zette hij de flesch aan den mond en goot heel
den inhoud door zijn keelgat. En het klonk als 't gerucht van een
bruisenden waterval.
De vrouw stond verstomd en vroeg:
--Hoe legt gij het aan boord om zulk een dikke flesch in uw mageren
buik te gieten?
Uilenspiegel antwoordde niet, doch sprak tot den baas:
--Breng ons een hammeken met brood, en nog een volle flesch klauwaard,
dat wij eten en drinken.
Zoo deden zij.
Terwijl de vrouw smulde van een stukje zwoord, nam hij heur zoo
onverwachts, zoo heimelijk om de lenden, dat zij er verrast en verrukt
over was.
Toen vroeg zij hem:
--Hoe komt het, met al uwe deugd, dat gij dorstig als eene spons,
vraatzuchtig als een wolf en ondernemend als een minnaar zijt?
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Nadat ik op honderd manieren gezondigd had, zwoer ik, lijk gij weet,
boetveerdigheid te plegen. Dat heeft wel een groot uur geduurd. Ik
dacht tijdens dit uur aan mijn toekomstig leven en zag dezen droeven
toestand in 't verschiet: niets hebben dan droog brood om mijn honger
te stillen, niets dan water om mijnen dorst te lesschen, de minne
ontvluchten; niet durven verroeren of niet durven niezen, uit vreeze
van kwaad te doen; geëerd zijn door allen, gevreesd door een iegelijk;
alleen en verlaten als een melaatsche; treurig als een hond, die zijn
meester kwijt is, en, na een dergelijk vijftigjarig martelaarsleven,
weemoedig op eenen stroozak verrekken. De boete was langdurig genoeg;
kus mij, liefste, en laat ons getweeën het vagevuur verlaten.
--Ha! zeide zij, bereidwillig gehoorzamend, de deugd is een schoon
vendel om aan eenen stok te binden.
De tijd verliep met dit dartel minnespel; doch zij moesten opstaan
om te vertrekken, want te midden van het blijde gejoel vreesde het
meideken steeds den provoost Spelle te zien verschijnen, met zijne
beulsknechten.
--Sla uwen rok over ons hoofd, sprak Uilenspiegel.
En als herten liepen zij naar Destelbergen, naar de Drie Koningen,
alwaar zij Lamme aan 't eten vonden.
XXXI.
Te Gent ging Uilenspiegel dikwijls bij Jacob Scoelap, bij Livinus
Smet en bij Jan de Wulfslaeger, die hem kond gaven van den voor-
of tegenspoed van den edelen Zwijger.
En als Uilenspiegel naar Destelbergen terugkwam, vroeg Lamme hem
telkens:
--Welk nieuws brengt gij mede? Goed of slecht?
--Laas! zeide Uilenspiegel, de Zwijger, zijn broeder Lodewijk, de
andere hoofdlieden en de Franschen hadden besloten vooruit te rukken
in Frankrijk, om zich met den prins van Condé aan te sluiten. Op die
wijze waren zij er wellicht in geslaagd het arm Belgisch vaderland
en het vrije geweten te redden. God liet dit niet toe, de Duitsche
ruiters en landsknechten weigerden verder te gaan, en zeiden dat hun
eed sprak van tegen den hertog van Alva te vechten, doch niet tegen
Frankrijk. Hij heeft hun gesmeekt hun plicht te doen, doch tevergeefs;
de Zwijger was gedwongen hen langs Champagne en Lotharingen te brengen
naar Straatsburg, van waar zij naar Duitschland terugkeerden. Alles
mislukt door dit plotseling en halsstarrig vertrek: de koning van
Frankrijk weigert, niettegenstaande zijn verdrag met den prins, het
geld te storten, dat hij hem beloofd had; de koningin van Engeland
had er hem willen zenden om de stad en het land van Kales weder in
bezit te krijgen; heure brieven werden onderschept door den hertog
van Lotharingen, die er een afwijzend antwoord op zond.
... Aldus zien wij dat schoon leger, al onze hoop op redding,
verzwinden als spoken bij den zonsopgang; maar God is met ons, en als
de aarde ons ontsnapt, zullen wij te water voortwerken. Leve de Geus!
XXXII.
Badend in tranen, kwam 't meideken zeggen tot Lamme en tot
Uilenspiegel:
--Te Meulestede laat Spelle, voor geld, moordenaars en coquinen
ontsnappen. En onschuldigen doet hij ter dood brengen. Mijn broeder
Michielken is onder hen. Laas! laat mij het U zeggen: gij zijt
mannen, gij zult hem wreken. Een eerlooze, ontuchtige vuilbaard,
Pieter de Roose, bevlekker van kinderen en verleider van meidekens,
is de oorzaak van al het kwaad. Laas! mijn arme broeder Michielken
en Pieter de Roose zaten op een avond, doch niet aan dezelfde tafel,
in de taveerne den Valk, alwaar Pieter de Roose door een iegelijk
geschuwd werd als de pest.
... Mijn broeder, die met hem in dezelfde zaal niet wilde vertoeven,
schold hem uit voor vuilbaard en beval hem onmiddellijk zijne biezen
te pakken.
... Pieter de Roose antwoordde:
--De broeder van een publieke loddege zou minder van zijnen neus
moeten maken,
... Hij loog, want ik ben geen publieke loddege; ik geef mij alleen
aan hen, die ik minne.
... Toen smeet Michielken hem zijn pint klauwaard naar den kop, hem
toeroepende dat hij er om loog, lijk een smerige vuilbaard die hij was;
daarbij bedreigde hij hem met eene aftelling naar de eerste goesting,
als hij niet dadelijk opkraamde.
... De andere wilde nog antwoorden, doch Michielken deed als hij
gezegd had: hij sloeg tweemaal met de vuist op zijn aangezicht en
trok hem bij den snoet op de straat, alwaar hij hem, zonder deernis,
gansch bebloed en gekneusd op een mesthoop smeet.
... Als Pieter de Roose, die in alleenigheid niet kon leven, genezen
was, ging hij in het Vagevier, eene taveerne, die heuren naam niet
gestolen heeft; zóó treurig en somber is zij, dat zij maar bezocht
wordt door arme lieden en bedelaars. Daar ook werd hij alleen gelaten,
geschuwd, zelfs door de armzalige menschen. En niemand richtte het
woord tot hem, behalve eenige boeren, die hem niet kenden, en eenige
truwanten en diepers of weggeloopen soldaten. Herhaalde malen zelfs
werd hij er geslagen, want hij is twistziek van aard.
... Toen provoost Spelle met zijne beide hangmannen te Meulestede
kwam, volgde Pieter de Roose hem overal op als een hond; op dezes
kosten propte Spelle zich vol met wijn, met vleesch en smaakte alle
genoegens, die voor geld te koop zijn. Zoo werd Pieter de Roose hun
vriend en metgezel en deed hij alles wat zijn slecht karakter hem
ingaf om degenen te folteren, die hij verfoeide, en dat waren al de
inwoners van Meulestede, doch mijn armen broeder het meest.
... Eerst en vooral begon hij met Michielken. Valsche getuigen,
rabauwen, die gretig naar guldens waren, verklaarden dat Michielken een
heretiek was, dat hij vuile reden gehouden had over Onze-Lieve-Vrouwe,
en meermalen den naam van God en de santen en santinnen gelasterd
had in de taveerne den Valk, en dat hij daarenboven voor 't minst
driehonderd florijnen in eene kist liggen had.
... Alhoewel de getuigen geenszins van goed en zedelijk gedrag
waren, werd Michielken gevangengenomen. Daar Spelle en zijne knechten
verklaard hadden, dat de bewijzen voldoende waren om den beschuldigde
op de pijnbank te leggen, werd Michielken bij de armen gehangen aan
eene katrol, die in de zoldering vastgemaakt was, nadat men aan elken
zijner voeten een gewicht van vijftig pond had gebonden.
... Hij loochende het stuk en zei dat, zoo er te Meulestede een
truwant, een rabauw, een godslasteraar en een vuilbaard liep, het
wel Pieter de Roose was, maar hij niet.
... Doch Spelle wilde niets hooren, en beval den beulsknechten
Michielken op te trekken tot aan de zoldering en hem vervolgens in eens
te laten nedervallen, met de gewichten aan zijne voeten. Dat deden zij,
en wel zoo wreedelijk, dat de huid en de spieren van den ongelukkige
vaneenscheurden en dat de voeten nog nauwelijks aan de beenen hingen.
... Michielken volhardde in zijne verklaring, dat hij onschuldig was;
Spelle deed hem opnieuw folteren en liet hem verstaan dat hij hem
vrijelijk zou laten henengaan, zoo hij hem honderd gulden wilde ter
hand stellen.
... Michielken zei, dat hij nog liever alle tormenten verduurde.
... Toen die van Meulestede de gevangenneming vernomen hadden, wilden
zij bij hoopen voor Michielken komen getuigen.
... Michielken is geen ketter, zeiden eenstemmig al de goede burgers
van de gemeente, want hij ging alle Zondagen naar de misse en
naderde alle hoogdagen de heilige tafel; zij getuigden verder, dat
hij over Onze-Lieve-Vrouwe nooit eenig andere rede gehouden had dan
heure hulp in te roepen in moeilijke aangelegenheden; dat hij nooit
kwaad gesproken had van eenige vrouw op aarde, en hij dienvolgens
het nog minder hadde gedurfd van de hemelsche moeder Gods. Wat de
godslasteringen betreft, die de valsche getuigen, naar hun zeggen,
in de taveerne den Valk hadden hooren uitbraken, dat was gelogen van
't begin tot het einde, zeiden de getuigen.
... Toen werd Michielken losgelaten, en de valsche getuigen
gestraft. En Spelle deed Pieter de Roose voor zijne vierschaar
verschijnen, doch liet hem weder los, zonder een onderzoek te doen
of hem op de pijnbank te leggen, mits honderd gulden aanstonds betaald.
... Pieter de Roose vluchtte uit Meulestede, uit vreeze dat het
hem nog blijvende geld opnieuw de aandacht van Spelle zou wekken,
terwijl Michielken, mijn arme broeder, stierf van den kanker, die
zich aan zijne voeten gezet had.
... Hij, die mij niet meer bezien wilde, deed mij toch roepen om mij
te zeggen goed te letten op het vuur, dat brandt in mijn lichaam,
en dat mij zeker naar de helle zou leiden. En ik kon slechts weenen,
want het vuur brandt in mijn lichaam, en het is mijne schuld niet.
... En in mijne armen gaf hij den geest.
--Ha! zeide zij, hij, die op Spelle den dood van mijn zoeten en
beminden broeder zou wreken, zou voor eeuwig mijn meester zijn, en
'k zou hem gehoorzamen als een gewillige hond.
Terwijl zij sprak, klopte de assche van Klaas op Uilenspiegel's borst.
En hij besloot Spelle, den moordenaar, te doen hangen.
Boelkin, zoo was de naam van het meideken, keerde gerust terug naar
heur huis te Meulestede, zonder de wraak van Pieter de Roose te
vreezen, want een koerier, die voor zaken naar Destelbergen gekomen
was, verwittigde heur dat de parochiepaap en de poorters verklaard
hadden, dat zij Spelle vóór den hertog zouden doen verschijnen,
bijaldien hij de hand dorst leggen op de zuster van Michielken.
Uilenspiegel, die het meideken vergezelschapt had naar Meulestede,
kwam in de benedenkamer van het huis van Michielken, en zag daar het
konterfeitsel van een meester-pasteibakker.
Hij veronderstelde dat dit het portret van den armen doode was.
En Boelkin zeide:
--Dat is mijn rampzalige broeder.
Uilenspiegel nam het konterfeitsel en sprak:
--Spelle wordt gehangen!
--Hoe zult ge dat doen? vroeg zij.
--Moest gij het weten, antwoordde hij, dan zoudt gij geenerlei genoegen
meer smaken als gij het ziet.
Boelkin schudde het hoofd en zei met jammerende stemme:
--Gij hebt geen vertrouwen in mij.
--Hoe zoo? sprak Uilenspiegel. Is het integendeel geen groot bewijs
van vertrouwen als ik u zeg: "Spelle wordt gehangen?" Met dat woord
alleen kunt gij mij doen hangen vóór hem.
--Inderdaad, antwoordde zij.
--Dus, hernam Uilenspiegel, haal mij wat goede klei, een dobbele
pint bruinbier, klaar water en eenige sneden ossevleesch. Alles moet
afzonderlijk zijn.
... Het vleesch is voor mij, het bruinbier voor het vleesch, het
water voor de klei en de klei voor het konterfeitsel.
Uilenspiegel at en dronk, terwijl hij de klei kneedde; soms at hij
er wel een brokje van, doch daar sloeg hij geen acht op, want heel
aandachtig beschouwde hij het konterfeitsel van Boelkin's broeder.
Toen de klei gekneed was, maakte hij daarvan een masker, met een neus,
eenen mond, oogen en ooren, dat zulke groote gelijkenis had met de
trekken van den doode, dat Boelkin er oprecht over verwonderd was.
Daarna legde hij het masker in den oven te drogen. Toen het droog
was, beschilderde hij het met de kleur van de lijken, met verwilderde
oogen en een pijnlijk en getrokken gelaat, als dat van een zieltogende.
Toen was het meideken niet meer verwonderd, doch ze bekeek het masker,
zonder er van de oogen te kunnen slaan; ze werd bleek, ontstelde,
bedekte heur gezicht met de handen, en huiverend sprak zij:
--Hij is het, mijn arm Michielken!
Met klei maakte Uilenspiegel ook twee bloedige voeten.
Boelkin, die van heur eersten schrik bekomen was, zei op plechtigen
toon:
--Gezegend is hij, die den moordenaar zal vermoorden.
Uilenspiegel nam het masker en de voeten en sprak:
--Nu moet ik iemand hebben, die mij wil helpen.
Boelkin antwoordde:
--Ga naar de Blauwe Gans, bij Joost Lansaem van Ieperen, dewelke deze
taveerne houdt. Hij was de beste kameraad, de trouwste vriend van
mijn ongelukkigen broeder. Zeg hem, dat het Boelkin is, die u zendt.
Uilenspiegel deed zooals zij hem heette.
Na zijn dagelijksch werk voor den dood, ging provoost Spelle 's
avonds in de Valk warmen dobbelen klauwaard drinken, die gekookt was
met kaneel en met Madeira-suiker. Uit vreeze van gehangen te worden,
dorst men hem, in de afspanning, niets weigeren.
Pieter de Roose, die weer moed gevat had, was naar Meulestede
teruggekeerd. Overal volgde hij Spelle en zijne beulsknechten, om
door hen beschermd te worden.
En Spelle trakteerde hem soms. En samen dronken zij blijde met het
geld der onschuldige slachtofferen.
Maar de taveerne de Valk werd niet meer bezocht zooals in de schoone
dagen dat het dorpje in vrede leefde, den Heer rechtzinnig diende en
nog niet gekweld werd op het stuk van religie. Nu, echter, was het
als in rouw gehuld; dat zag men aan zijn menigvuldige ledige huizen,
aan zijn eenzame straten, waar enkel eenige magere honden rondzwierven,
die in de mesthoopen wroetten, om hun eten te zoeken.
In Meulestede was er geene plaats meer dan voor de twee booswichten. De
verschrikte inwoners zagen hen heel den dag overmoedig rondloopen,
de huizen der aanstaande slachtofferen teekenen, de doodenlijsten
opmaken. En als zij 's avonds, onder 't zingen van vuile
liedekens, van den Valk terugkeerden, werden ze gevolgd door twee
beulsknechten, dronken als zij, en van top tot teen gewapend om hen
te vergezelschappen.
Uilenspiegel ging in de Blauwe Gans, bij Joost Lansaem, die achter
zijnen toog stond.
Uilenspiegel trok een fleschje brandewijn uit zijnen zak en zei tot
den baas:
--Boelkin heeft zoo twee tonnen te verkoopen.
--Kom binnen in de keuken, zei de baas.
Hij sloot de keukendeur achter zich en bezag Uilenspiegel vlak in
de oogen.
--Gij zijt geen koopman in brandewijn, sprak hij, wat beteekent uw
knipoogen? Wie zijt gij?
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Ik ben de zoon van Klaas, die te Damme verbrand werd; de assche van
den doode klopt op mijne borst: ik wil Spelle den moordenaar dooden.
--Is 't Boelkin, die u zendt? vroeg de weerd.
--Boelkin zendt mij bij u, antwoordde Uilenspiegel. Ik zal Spelle
dooden en gij zult mij helpen.
--Ik wil, zegde de baas. Wat moet ik doen?
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Ga bij den parochiepaap, die, als een goede herder, de vijand van
Spelle is. Verzamel uwe vrienden en kom morgen, na de slaapklok,
met hen op de Evergemsche baan, voorbij het huis van Spelle, tusschen
den Valk en het huis van dien snoodaard. Gij moet allen in de schaduw
blijven en moogt geen witte kleeren aanhebben. Op klokslag tien zult
gij Spelle uit de herberg zien komen, terwijl van den anderen kant
een wagen zal komen aanrijden.
... Dezen avond moogt gij uwe vrienden niet verwittigen; zij
slapen te dicht bij de ooren hunner vrouw. Eerst morgen zult gij ze
opzoeken. Komt, luistert goed, en weest alles indachtig.
--Wij zullen alles onthouden, sprak Joost.
En, met zijnen beker in de hand, sprak hij:
--Ik drink op de koorde van Spelle!
--Op zijne koorde! sprak Uilenspiegel.
Daarop keerde hij met den baas terug in de gelagkamer, waar eenige
Gentsche oude-kleerkoopers zaten te drinken. Zij kwamen van de
Zaterdagsmerkt, te Brugge, alwaar zij, tegen goeden prijs, zilver-
en goudlakensche wambuizen en opperste kleederen verschacherd hadden,
dewelke zij voor eenige oortjes gekocht hadden van edelen, die ten
onder gegaan waren door de weelde der Spanjaards te willen evenaren.
En zij gastreerden luidruchtig op de groote winsten, die zij behaald
hadden.
Uilenspiegel en Joost Lansaem gingen in eenen hoek zitten en, onder
't drinken, kwamen zij overeen, zonder gehoord te worden, dat Joost
bij den parochiepaap zou gaan, die kwaad was op Spelle, den moordenaar
van zoovele onschuldige slachtofferen.
Daarna zou hij de vrienden gaan vinden.
's Anderen daags kwamen de vrienden van Michielken, die verwittigd
waren, bijeen bij Joost Lansaem in de Blauwe Gans, alwaar zij, als naar
gewoonte en om hunne inzichten te verbergen, pinten op pinten dronken.
Bij de slaapklok gingen zij henen en begaven zich, langs verschillende
wegen, naar de Evergemsche baan.
Zij waren zeventien in getal.
Op slag van tien uren kwam Spelle uit den Valk, gevolgd door zijne
twee beulsknechten en door Pieter de Roose.
Lansaem en zijne gezellen waren verscholen in de schuur van Samson
Boone, een vriend van Michielken.
Spelle kon hen niet zien.
De vrienden van Michielken hoorden hem zwijmelend voorbijgaan, alsook
Pieter de Roose en de beide beulsknechten.
Met een zware tong, stamelde Spelle hikkend en snikkend:
--Provoosten! provoosten! die hebben hier op Gods aarde goed leven;
komaan, truwanten, die van mijn overschot leeft, ondersteunt mij toch
een beetje!
Maar, op den steenweg, van den kant van den kouter, hoorde men op
eens het gebalk van een ezel en 't geklap eener zweep.
--Dat moet een weerspannige ezel zijn, zij Spelle, want hij wil niet
vooruit, niettegenstaande het vriendelijk verzoek van de zweep.
Plotseling hoorde men een groot wielengeknars en eenen wagen, die
onstuimig over den steenweg stormde.
--Houdt hem tegen! riep Spelle.
Toen de wagen dicht bij hen was, sprongen Spelle en zijne twee
beulsknechten naar den kop van den ezel.
--In dien wagen steekt niets, hij is teenemaal ledig, sprak een van
de beulsknechten.
--Lomperik, zei Spelle, sedert wanneer rijden de wagens 's nachts
heel alleen op de baan? In dien wagen is iemand, die zich verbergt;
spoedt u, steekt de lanteernen aan en heft ze omhoog, ik zal kijken.
De lanteernen werden aangestoken en Spelle klom op den wagen met
zijne lanteerne in de hand; maar nauwelijks had hij gekeken, of hij
slaakte een grooten schreeuw en viel achterover, gillend:
--Michielken! Michielken! Jezus, ontferm u mijner!
In een hoek van den wagen stond een man, die in 't wit gekleed was,
lijk de pasteibakkers, en die, in de beide handen, bloedige voeten
vasthield.
Toen Pieter de Roose den man zag, die nu door het licht der lanteernen
beschenen was, riep hij als waanzinnig:
--Michielken! Michielken!
En de twee beulsknechten klappertandden en fluisterden:
--Michielken! Heer, ontferm u onzer!
Op het gerucht kwamen de zeventien vrienden bij, om het schouwspel
te zien, en allen verschrikten toen zij, bij het zilveren licht van
de maan, de treffende gelijkenis zagen van Michielken, den armen doode.
En de gedaante zwaaide steeds met de bloedige voeten.
Het was zijn zelfde vol en rond gezicht, doch verbleekt door den
dood, en grimmig, sneeuwwit keek het dreigend toe, en aan de kin
waren reeds de wormen aan 't knagen.
Het spook, dat altijd met de bloedige voeten zwaaide, zei met holle
stem tot Spelle, die op den rug lag te zuchten:
--Spelle! provoost Spelle, word wakker!
Maar Spelle verroerde zich niet.
--Spelle, sprak het spook opnieuw, provoost Spelle, word wakker,
of ik sleep u in den gapenden mond van de helle.
Spelle sukkelde recht en riep jammerlijk, met de haren te berge
van schrik:
--Michielken! Michielken! heb medelijden!
De poorters waren nader gekomen, doch Spelle zag niets anders dan de
lichtjes hunner lanteernen, die hij voor oogen van duivelen nam. Zoo,
ten minste, bekende hij later.
--Spelle, vervolgde de schim van Michielken, zijt gij tot sterven
bereid?
--Tot sterven, neen, antwoordde de provoost, neen, messire Michielken,
daar ben ik niet toe bereid, want ik wil vóór God niet verschijnen,
beladen met zoo menigvuldige zonden.
--Herkent gij mij? vroeg het spook.
--God weze mij genadig, zuchtte Spelle; ja, ik herken u; gij zijt
het spook van Michielken, den pasteibakker, die onschuldig stierf
in zijn bed, ten gevolge van de pijnen der foltering; en de twee
bloedige voeten zijn die, aan ieder derwelke ik een gewicht van
vijftig pond deed hangen. Ha! Michielken, ontferm u mijner, schenk
mij vergiffenis; die Pieter de Roose heeft mij in bekoring gebracht;
hij bood mij vijftig gulden, en ik heb ze aanveerd, om uwen naam in
het doodenboek te schrijven.
--Wilt gij biechten? vroeg het spook.
--Ja, messire, zeker wil ik biechten, alles bekennen en penitentie
doen. Maar verweerdig u toch die duivelen te doen weggaan, die daar
staan, bereid om mij te verslinden. Ik zal alles bekennen. Verwijder
die oogen van vuur! Ik heb hetzelfde gedaan te Doornijk, met vijf
onschuldige poorters, en ook te Brugge, met vier andere. Ik weet hunne
namen niet meer, maar ik zal ze opzoeken en ze u zeggen, als gij wilt;
elders nog heb ik insgelijks gezondigd, heer, en door mijn toedoen
zijn negen en zestig onschuldige martelaren ten grave gedaald.
... Michielken, de koning moest geld hebben. Men had het mij laten
weten, doch ik ook moest er hebben; het is te Gent, in den kelder,
onder de vloersteenen, bij de oude Gravels, mijn echte moeder. Ik
heb alles, alles gezegd; genade en ontferming! Doe de duivelen
weggaan. Heere God! Heilige Maagd Maria, wees mijn voorspreekster;
verwijder de vuren der helle! Ik zal alles verkoopen, alles aan de
arme geven en mijn leven lang boetveerdigheid plegen.
Uilenspiegel, ziende dat de menigte der toegeloopen poorters bereid
was om hem ter zijde te staan, sprong van den wagen naar de keel van
Spelle en wilde hem verworgen.
Maar de pastoor kwam bij.
--Laat hem leven, sprak hij, het is beter dat hij door beulshanden
sterve dan door die van een spook.
--Wat wilt gij er mee doen? vroeg Uilenspiegel.
--Hem vóór den hertog beschuldigen en naar verdienste doen hangen,
antwoordde de parochiepaap. Maar wie zijt gij? vroeg hij.
--Ik ben, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, het masker van Michielken en een
arme Vlaamsche vos, die terug naar zijn hol trekt, uit vreeze voor
de Spaansche jagers.
Intusschen nam Pieter de Roose in aller ijl de vlucht.
En Spelle werd gevonnist en gehangen, en zijne goederen
verbeurdverklaard.
En de koning erfde.
XXXIII.
's Anderen daags trok Uilenspiegel naar Kortrijk, langsheen den boord
van de Leie, met heur helder gouden water.
Jammerend volgde Lamme zijn vriend.
Uilenspiegel zei tot hem:
--Zucht gij nu weder, lafhertige ziele, voor de vrouw, die u een
hoornen kroon op het hoofd zette?
--Mijn vriend, antwoordde Lamme weemoedig, zij was mij altijd getrouw,
en beminde mij genoegzaam, lijk ik ze te zeer beminde, mijn zoete
Jezus. Eens dat zij naar Brugge gegaan was, kwam zij teenemaal
veranderd terug. Sedertdien, als ik heur van liefde sprak, gaf zij
mij tot antwoord:
--Ik moet met u leven als eene vriendinne, doch anders niet.
--Toen sprak ik, met den weemoed in mijn gebroken herte:
--Liefste mijne, wij zijn getrouwd voor den Heer. Deed ik voor u niet
alles wat gij wildet? Ging ik niet dikwijls gedost in een zwart linnen
wambuis of een bombazijnen opperste kleed, om u, niettegenstaande
de koninklijke ordonnantiën tegen de weelde, zijden en goudlakensche
kleeren te laten dragen? Bemint ge mij dan niet meer, liefste?
--Ik bemin u, sprak zij, volgens God en Zijne wetten, volgens de
heilige voorschriften en de boetveerdigheid. Nochtans zal ik een
deugdzame gezellin voor u wezen.
--Met uwe deugdzaamheid heb ik niets te maken, antwoordde ik; u is het,
die ik hebben wil, u, mijne vrouw!
--Zij schudde het hoofd en vervolgde:
--Ik weet, dat gij goed en braaf zijt; tot heden waart gij de kok in
ons huis, om mij het koken en het braden te sparen; tot heden streekt
gij onze lakens, kragen en hemden, omdat de ijzers mij te zwaar vielen;
gij deedt de wasch, gij kuischtet het huis en de straat vóór de deur,
om mij de minste vermoeienis te sparen. Thans wil ik werken in uwe
plaats, doch verder niets, mijn vriend.
--Ik geef daar niet om, antwoordde ik; ik zal als voorheen uwe
kamenier, uwe strijkster, uwe keukenmeid, uwe waschvrouw, uw
onderdanige slaaf wezen; maar schei toch geen twee herten en zielen,
die maar één wezen uitmaken; breek den zoeten liefdeband niet, die
ons zoo innig verbindt.
--Het moet, antwoordde zij.
--Laas! zeide ik, is het te Brugge, dat gij dit harde besluit hebt
genomen?
Zij antwoordde:
--Ik heb gezworen voor God en Zijne santen.
--Wie dan, riep ik uit, heeft u gedwongen te zweren uwe echtelijke
plichten niet meer te volbrengen?
--Hij, die den geest Gods in zich heeft en zich verweerdigt mij onder
't getal zijner boetelingen te tellen, sprak zij.
--Van dat oogenblik hield zij op mijne vrouw te wezen, alsof zij de
trouwe gezellin van een ander was.
--Ik smeekte, plaagde, dreigde haar; ik weende en bad, doch
tevergeefs. Op een avond, dat ik van Blankenberge terugkwam, alwaar ik
gegaan was om de halfwinning van een mijner hofsteden te ontvangen,
vond ik mijne vrouw niet meer in huis. Zij was onze halle ontvlucht;
ongetwijfeld was zij mijne smeekingen moede, of was zij vergramd of
droevig om mijn verdriet.
--Waar mag zij nu wezen?
En Lamme zette zich neer aan den boord van de Leie, met het hoofd in
zijne handen, en keek naar het water.
--Ha! mijne vriendin, sprak hij, wat waart gij teeder, poezel en
lieftallig! Zal ik ooit een duifje vinden als gij? Stoverije van
liefde, zal ik u nimmermeer proeven? Waar zijn uwe kussen, geurig
als ortolanen; waar is uw mond, op denwelken ik uw zoenen plukte,
als het bijtje den honig op de roze; waar zijn uw witte armen, die
mij streelend omhelsden? Waar is uw kloppend hert, uw ronde boezem
en die lieve huivering van uw aanbiddelijk lichaam, verlangend naar
liefde? Doch waar zijn uwe golven van vroeger, frissche rivier, die
uw nieuwe golfjes zoo blijde voortstuwt in 't gouden licht van de zon?
XXXIV.
De beide wandelaars kwamen voorbij het Petegemsche bosch; het was
snikkend heet. Lamme sprak tot Uilenspiegel:
--Ik braad; laat ons de schaduw opzoeken.
--'t Kan mij niet schelen, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
Zij zetten zich neer in het bosch, op het gras, en zagen eenen troep
herten voorbijrennen.
--Kijk goed, Lamme, zei Uilenspiegel, die den haan zijner Duitsche
bus overtrok. Daar zijn groote, oude herten, die hun gewei met negen
takken fier in de lucht dragen; lieve reebokjes, die hunne schildknapen
zijn, huppelen aan hunne zijde, bereid om hun van dienst te zijn met
hun puntige horens. Zij gaan naar hun leger. Trek het rad van uwe
bus over, lijk ik. Schiet. Het oude hert is gewond. Een reebokje is
getroffen aan de bil; het vlucht. Laten wij het volgen totdat het
valt. Doe lijk ik, loop, spring, vlieg....
--Mijn gekke vriend is wederom bezig, sprak Lamme, hij wil de herten
te voet achternazetten. Beproef niet te vliegen zonder vleugelen,
't is verloren moeite. Gij zult ze niet krijgen. Ha! wat wreedaardige
gezel! Meent gij, dat ik zoo vlug ben als gij? Ik zweet, mijn vriend;
ik zweet en ik ga vallen van vermoeidheid. Als de houtvester u pakt,
wordt gij gehangen. Herten zijn koningswild; laat ze loopen, mijn zoon,
gij kunt ze toch niet krijgen.
--Kom, sprak Uilenspiegel. Hoort gij het gerucht van zijn gewei in
de bladeren? 't Is als eene hoos, die voorbijvliegt. Zie eens deze
gebroken takken, de bladeren, waarmede de grond teenemaal bedekt
is. Nu heeft het een nieuwen kogel in de bil; fluks eten wij het op.
--Het is nog niet gebraden, zeide Lamme. Laat die arme dieren maar
loopen. He! wat is het warm! Ge moogt mij gelooven: ik ga er bij
vallen om nimmermeer op te staan.
Doch eensklaps kwamen armzalig gekleede mannen, die wapenen droegen,
te allen kanten te voorschijn uit het bosch. Blaffende honden renden
de herten achterna. Vier mannen met woest uitzicht kwamen rond Lamme
en Uilenspiegel staan en leidden hen naar eene plaats, te midden in
het dichtst begroeide deel van het woud.
Daar zagen zij vrouwen en kinderen, die daar gelegerd waren, en
ook een groot getal mannen, allen op verschillende wijze gewapend
met zweerden, met bussen, met voetbogen, met lansen, met spiesen,
met ruiterspistolen.
Toen Uilenspiegel hen zag, zei hij tot hen:
--Gij schijnt hier in gemeenschap te leven om de vervolging te
ontvluchten; zijt gij soms de Broeders van het Woud?
--Wij zijn de Broeders van het Woud, antwoordde een grijsaard, die bij
het vuur zat en eenige vogelen in eene braadpan liet bakken. Maar gij,
wie zijt gij?
--Ik ben uit het schoone Vlaanderenland vandaan, antwoordde
Uilenspiegel, en ben schilder, boer, edelman, beeldhouwer, alles te
gelijk. En door de wereld ga ik aldus, om het goede en het schoone
te prijzen, en luidkeels te lachen en te spotten met alles wat dwaas
en verkeerd is.
--Als gij zoovele landen bereisd hebt, sprak de oude man, moet gij
Schild en Vriend kunnen uitspreken, naar de wijs van de Gentenaren; zoo
niet, zijt gij een valsche Vlaming en moet gij u tot sterven bereiden.
Uilenspiegel sprak:
--Schild en Vriend.
--En gij, dikzak? vroeg de oude man tot Lamme, welk bedrijf voert
gij uit?
Lamme antwoordde:
--Mijne landerijen, pachthoeven, cijnzen en messeniën opeten, mijn
echtelijke vrouw zoeken, en mijn vriend Uilenspiegel in alle oorden
en plaatsen opvolgen.
--Als gij ook zooveel gereisd hebt, sprak de oude man, moet gij weten
hoe die van Weert, in Limburg, worden geheeten?
--Ik weet het niet, was 't antwoord van Lamme, maar kunt gij mij
den naam niet zeggen van den ellendigen deugniet, die mijne vrouw
overreede heur huis te verlaten? Zeg mij zijn naam, en dadelijk ga
ik hem vermoorden.
De oude man antwoordde:
--In deze wereld bestaan twee dingen, die nimmermeer wederkomen, eens
dat zij weg zijn: te weten het verteerde geld, en de onverschillig
geworden vrouw, die den huize ontvlucht is.
Toen wendde de oude man zich tot Uilenspiegel en stelde hij hem ook
deze vraag:
--En gij, weet gij niet hoe die van Weert, in Limburg, worden geheeten?
--De rogstekers, wat in hunne streek onttooveraars van roggen bediedt.
--Kunt gij ook zeggen waarom?
--Een levende rog, gevallen uit de kar van een vischverkooper, lag
zoodanig te spartelen op den weg, dat eenige oude wijven ze voor den
duivel namen. "Laat ons den parochiepaap halen om den duivel uit de
rog te verbannen", zeiden zij. De pastoor bezweerde de rog, en nam ze
mede naar huis, alwaar hij ze kookte, ter eere van die van Weert. Mocht
het Gode behagen hetzelfde lot te bescheren aan den bloedigen koning!
Intusschen hoorde men, in het bosch, 't geblaf van de honden
weerklinken. De gewapende mannen liepen het woud in, en riepen
luidkeels om het wild schrik aan te jagen.
--Het zijn de dieren, die ik achternagezet heb, zeide Uilenspiegel.
--Wij zullen ze opeten, sprak de oude man. Maar zeg mij nog: hoe
noemt men die van Eindhoven, in Limburg?
--De pinnemakers, antwoordde Uilenspiegel. Eens was de vijand vóór de
poort hunner stede, en zij grendelden die vast met eenen wortel. De
ganzen kwamen en begonnen gulzig in den wortel te pikken, en de
vijand rukte Eindhoven binnen. Maar ijzeren bekken zullen het wezen,
die de pinnen zullen vaneen pikken, achter dewelke men het vrije
geweten wil kerkeren.
--Als God met ons is, wie kan tegen ons zijn? antwoordde de oude man.
Uilenspiegel sprak:
--Hondengeblaf, mannengeschreeuw en gebroken takken: het stormt in
het woud.
--Is hertenvleesch lekkere spijze? vroeg Lamme, terwijl hij de
stoverije bekeek.
--Het geroep der drijvers komt nader en nader, zei Uilenspiegel tot
Lamme; de honden zijn nabij. Wat gedonder! Het hert! het hert! uit
den weg, mijn vriend! Foei! wat leelijk beest, het heeft mijn dikken
vriend ten gronde geworpen, te midden van potten, pannen, mooren,
ketels en stoverije. Waanzinnig van schrik, gaan de vrouwen en
meidekens op den loop. Maar gij bloedt, mijn vriend?
--Gij lacht, nietdeug, sprak Lamme. Ja, ik bloed, het dier heeft mij
met de horens eenen stoot op mijn achterste gegeven. Zie, mijne hooze
is gescheurd, en mijn vel insgelijks, en al die lekkere stoverije
ten gronde! Zie, ik verlies zooveel bloed, dat mijne kous er gansch
mee besmeurd is.
--Dat hert is een knap chirurgijn, het heeft U van eene geraaktheid
gered, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Foei, hertelooze deugniet die ge zijt, sprak Lamme verwijtend. Doch
ik zal U niet meer volgen. Hier blijf ik, te midden van deze goede
mannen en vrouwen. Hoe kunt ge toch zoo schaamteloos wezen, ongevoelig
te zijn voor mijne smerten, alswanneer ik u volg op de hielen, als
een hondje, door sneeuw, door vorst, door hagel en wind en, als het
heet is, mijne ziel door mijn vel zweet?
--Wees gerust, 't is niet erg. Leg een oliekoekje op uwe wonde,
het zal een gebakken pleister zijn, antwoordde Uilenspiegel. Maar
weet gij hoe die van Leuven worden geheeten? Gij weet het niet,
mijn arme vriend? Hewel, ik zal het u zeggen, maar gij moogt niet
meer schreien. Men heet ze de koeienschieters: want eens waren
ze zoo onnoozel naar weerlooze koeien te schieten, die zij voor
vijandelijke soldaten aanzagen. Wat ons betreft, wij schieten naar
de Spaansche bokken, hun vleesch stinkt als de pest, maar hun vel is
goed om trommelen van te maken. En die van Thienen? Weet gij het? Ook
al niet? Zij hebben den glorierijken naam van kwekkers. Want bij
hen vliegt, op Sinksen, in de groote kerk, een eendvogel van het
oksaal naar het autaar, en dat is de beeltenis van hunnen Heiligen
Geest. Leg eenen heete koek op uwe wonde. Het zal niet erg zijn,
want ik zie dat gij, zonder een woord te vertellen, de mooren en
stoverije opraapt, die het hert omver gesmeten heeft. Uw moed behoort
vooral thuis in de keuken. Gij steekt het vuur opnieuw aan, brengt den
soepketel terug op zijne drie palen, en houdt u zorgvuldig bezig met
de kook. Weet gij waarom er vier wonderen te Leuven zijn? Neen? Ik
zal het u zeggen. Ten eerste, omdat de levenden er onder de dooden
gaan, want St.-Michielskerk is gebouwd dicht bij de poort van de
stad. Haar kerkhof ligt op den berm der wallen; ten tweede, omdat de
klokken er buiten de torens hangen, gelijk men aan St.-Jacobskerk
ziet, waar een groote klok en een kleine klok zijn; daar de kleine
in den toren niet meer kon geplaatst worden, heeft men ze buiten
gehangen. Ten derde, omdat de autaren buiten de kerk staan, want de
gevel van St.-Jacobskerk lijkt op een autaar. Ten vierde, ter oorzake
van den Toren-zonder-Nagels, omdat de torenspits van Ste-Geertrui
van steen gemaakt is en niet van hout, en dat men in steenen geene
nagelen slaat, behalve in het hert van den bloedigen koning, dat ik
boven aan de groote poort van Brussel zou willen spijkeren. Maar, gij
luistert niet. Hebt gij zout in het eten gedaan? Weet gij waarom die
van Dendermonde de vuurpannen heeten? Omdat, toen eens een jonge prins
in de afspanning de Wapens van Vlaanderen moest komen vernachten,
de baas niet wist hoe hij het bed warm zou krijgen, want hij had
geene vuurpan. Hij deed het bed verwarmen door zijne dochter, die,
zoodra zij den prins hoorde bovenkomen, ijlings de vlucht nam, en de
prins vroeg waarom men de pan uit het bed had genomen. God believe
dat koning Philippus, in een gloeienden ijzeren trommel gestoken,
tot vuurpan diene voor het leger van Astarte.
--Laat mij gerust, zeide Lamme; ik lach met u, met uwe vuurpannen,
met uwen Toren-zonder-Nagels, met uwe Astarte en met al de flauwe kul,
die gij verkoopt. Trek mij niet af van mijne sausen.
--Pas op, sprak Uilenspiegel. Het geblaf houdt niet op, het komt
dichter en dichter, de honden huilen, de trompetten weerschallen. Pas
op voor het hert.
Op die woorden nam Lamme de vlucht, en Uilenspiegel riep hem nog
achterna:
--Hoort gij de jachthorens?
--'t Is niets, Lamme, kom terug bij uwe stoverije, sprak de oude
man. 't Zijn de honden, die hun deel van het wild krijgen; het hert
is dood.
--Dat zal ons een lekkeren maaltijd bezorgen, sprak Lamme. Ik hoop
wel dat gij mij zult nooden, ter oorzake van de moeite, die ik mij
geef voor ulieden. De saus van de vogelen zal lekker zijn, maar ze
kraakt toch een weinig. Dat kan ook niet missen, want de vogelen
zijn in het zand gevallen, als die groote duivel van een hert op mij
kwam gestormd, en mijn wambuis en mijn vel al te zamen aan stukken
trok. Maar zeg eens, vreest gij de houtvesters niet?
--Wij zijn al te talrijk, sprak de oude man; zij zijn bevreesd en
verontrusten ons niet. Ook de serjanten, beulsknechten en rechters
laten ons met vrede. De inwoners van de steden zien ons geerne,
want wij doen hun geen kwaad. Wij zullen hier nog eenigen tijd
leven in vrede, ten ware het Spaansche leger ons omsingelde. Mocht
dat gebeuren, zoo zouden wij, grijsaards, jonge mannen, vrouwen,
dochteren, knapen en meidekens, ons leven duur verkoopen, en liever
nog doodden wij elkander, dan duizend folteringen te lijden door de
hand van den bloedigen hertog.
Uilenspiegel sprak:
De tijd is voorbij, dat men den gruwzamen beul te lande bestreed. 't
Is op zee, dat wij zijne macht moeten fnuiken. Gaat naar den kant van
de Zeeuwsche eilanden, over Brugge, Heist en Knokke, langs het duin.
--Wij bezitten geen duit, spraken zij.
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Hier zijn duizend karolussen vanwege den prins. Gaat voort langsheen
de waterloopen, vaarten, stroomen en rivieren; als gij schepen ziet met
het merk J-H-S, dat een uwer het gezang des leeuweriks nabootse. Een
hanengekraai zal U antwoorden. En gij zult wezen bij vrienden, bij
soldaten van 't vrije geweten.
--Wij zullen het doen, zeiden de mannen.
De jagers, gevolgd door de honden, verschenen weldra, en trokken met
koorden het doode hert achter zich.
Toen zetten allen zich neer rond het vuur.
Zij waren wel zestig in getal, mannen, vrouwen en kinderen.
Het brood werd uit de weitasschen gehaald, de messen uit de scheeden
getrokken. Het hert werd aan stukken gesneden, gestroopt, geruimd,
en met het kleinere wild aan het braadspit gestoken.
En, na den maaltijd, zag men Lamme tegen eenen boom zitten snorken,
met het hoofd op de borst.
Toen de avond gevallen was, trokken de Broeders van het Woud in holen
onder den grond om te slapen, en Lamme en Uilenspiegel deden hetzelfde.
Gewapende mannen hielden de wacht rond het kamp. En Uilenspiegel
hoorde de droge bladeren onder hunne voeten kraken.
En 's anderen daags morgens ging hij henen met Lamme, terwijl die
van het kamp zeiden tot hem:
--God zegene u; wij gaan naar de zee.
XXXV.
Te Harelbeke vernieuwde Lamme zijnen voorraad oliekoeken. Hij vond
ze zoo lekker, dat hij er zeven en twintig zelf opat en dertig in
zijnen korf stak.
Uilenspiegel droeg zijne vogelkooien in de hand.
Rond den avond kwamen zij te Kortrijk, alwaar zij afstapten in de
afspanning de Bie, bij Gillis Vanden Ende, die aan zijne deur kwam,
zoodra hij het gezang des leeuweriks hoorde.
Daar leefden zij als vischjes in 't water. Toen de weerd de brieven
des prinsen gezien had, stelde hij Uilenspiegel vijftig karolussen ter
hand voor den Zwijger; bovendien wilde hij niets voor den kalkoen,
dien hij opgediend had, noch voor den dubbelen klauwaard, waarmede
hij hem rijkelijk besproeide. Ook verwittigde hij hem, dat er spionnen
van den Bloedraad in Kortrijk rondliepen, weshalve hij en zijn gezel
goed op hunne tong moesten letten.
--Wij zullen ze wel herkennen, zeiden Lamme en Uilenspiegel.
De zonne neigde ten Westen en vergulde de gevelspitsen der huizen;
de vogelen zongen hun avondgebed; de vrouwen praatten op de zulle
harer deuren; de kinderen stoeiden in het stof en Uilenspiegel en
Lamme dwaalden op goed-valle-'t-uit door straten en stegen.
Eensklaps sprak Lamme:
--Ik heb aan Gillis Vanden Ende gevraagd of hij geene vrouw gezien had,
die op de mijne geleek--ik gaf hem zoo goed als ik kon de beschrijving
van heur bekoorlijk gezicht--en hij zei mij dat, bij Stevenijne, op
den Brugschen steenweg, in den Regenboog, buiten de stad, alle avonden
een groot getal vrouwen bijeenkomen. Ik trek er aanstonds naar toe.
--Ik zal u daar komen vinden, sprak Uilenspiegel. Ik wil de stad
eens afzien; als ik uwe vrouw tegenkom, zal ik ze dadelijk bij u
zenden. Vergeet niet, dat de baas u voor raad heeft gegeven op uwe
tong te passen, zoo gij aan uw leven houdt.
--Wees gerust, sprak Lamme.
Uilenspiegel wandelde op zijn gemak rond de stad; de zonne ging onder
en de avond viel snel.
Uilenspiegel kwam in een eenzame steeg. Daar hoorde hij kunstig op de
vedel spelen; toen hij nadergekomen was, zag hij van verre een witte
gedaante, die hem riep, doch wegvluchtte en steeds op de vedel speelde.
Maar Uilenspiegel liep sneller dan zij; hij haalde heur in, greep ze
vast en wilde heur aanspreken; maar zij legde heure hand, die naar
benzoë rook, op zijnen mond.
--Zijt gij gemeene burger of edelman? vroeg zij.
--Ik ben Uilenspiegel.
--Zijt gij rijk?
--Rijk genoeg om een hemelsch genot te betalen, niet genoeg om mijne
ziel af te koopen.
--Hebt gij geen peerd, dat gij te voet gaat?
--Ik had een ezel, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, maar ik heb hem op stal
gelaten.
--Hoe komt het dat gij alleen, zonder vrienden of dienaren, rondzwerft
in een vreemde stede?
--Omdat mijn vriend zijnerzijds ergens ronddwaalt lijk ik mijnerzijds,
nieuwsgierige schoone.
--Ik ben geenszins nieuwsgierig, antwoordde zij. Is hij rijk,
uw vriend?
--Ja, hij is rijk, doch in vet, sprak Uilenspiegel. Maar hebt gij
haast gedaan met mij te ondervragen?
--Ik heb gedaan, zeide zij, laat mij nu.
--U laten? sprak hij, 't was precies alsof men tot Lamme, als hij
honger heeft, zou zeggen eene pateel ortolanen te laten staan. Van
u wil ik eten.
--Maar gij hebt mij nog niet gezien, zeide zij.
En zij opende eene lanteerne, die plotseling heur aangezicht
verlichtte.
--Hoe schoon! sprak Uilenspiegel. Ho! wat schoone lichtbruine huid, wat
zachte oogen, wat roode mond, wat liefelijk lichaam! Alles zij mijn!
--Alles, sprak zij.
En zij bracht hem bij Stevenijne, op den Brugschen steenweg, in
den Regenboog.
Uilenspiegel zag daar een groot getal meidekens, die aan den arm
schijfjes droegen van een andere kleur dan die van heur bombazijnen
kleed.
De gezellinne van Uilenspiegel had een zilverlakensch schijfje op
een goudlinnen kleed. En al de meidekens bezagen heur met afgunst.
Bij het binnenkomen had zij de bazinne eenen wenk gegeven, maar
Uilenspiegel had het niet bemerkt: zij zetten zich getweeën neder
en dronken.
--Weet gij, sprak zij, dat wie mij eens beminde, voor eeuwig mijn is?
--Schoone, welriekende deerne, sprak Uilenspiegel, het ware mij een
heerlijk festijn eeuwig uwe genuchten te smaken.
Eensklaps zag hij Lamme in eenen hoek zitten, met een tafeltje voor
zich, waarop eene keers, eene hesp en een pot bier stonden; hij had
het zeer druk om zijne hesp en zijn bier te verdedigen tegen twee
meidekens, die met alle geweld met hem wilden eten en drinken.
Toen Lamme zijn vriend Uilenspiegel gewaar werd, kwam hij voor hem
staan en sprong wel drie voet hoog van blijdschap.
--God zij geloofd, sprak hij, omdat Hij mij mijnen vriend Uilenspiegel
teruggeeft! Bazinne, breng ons te drinken!
Uilenspiegel trok zijne tasch uit en sprak:
--Te drinken tot dit op is!
En hij deed zijne karolussen rinkelen.
--Leve God! sprak Lamme, die hem gezwind de tassche uit de hand trok,
ik ben 't die betaal, maar gij niet! Deze tassche is mijn!
Uilenspiegel wilde met geweld zijne tassche terugnemen, doch Lamme
hield ze stevig vast. Terwijl zij met elkander vochten, de een om de
tassche te houden, de andere om ze terug te nemen, sprak Lamme stille
tot Uilenspiegel:
--Luister: serjanten in huis ... ze zijn gevieren ... in een kleine
kamer met drie meidekens.... Twee buiten voor u, voor mij.... Heb
willen weggaan ... ben belet geworden.... De deerne met heur goudlinnen
kleed is eene verklikster ... Stevenijne, ook verklikster!
Terwijl zij met elkander vochten, luisterde Uilenspiegel goed naar
Lamme en riep hij:
--Mijne tasch terug, dieper!
--Gij zult ze niet hebben, sprak Lamme.
En zij vatten elkander bij den nek, bij de schouderen en rolden ten
gronde, terwijl Lamme stille alles zeide tot Uilenspiegel wat deze
diende te weten.
Maar de baas uit de Bie kwam eensklaps binnen met zeven mannen, die
hij niet scheen te kennen. Hij kraaide als de haan en Uilenspiegel
floot als de leeuwerik.
Toen de baas Uilenspiegel en Lamme samen aan 't vechten zag, vroeg
hij tot Stevenijne:
--Wat zijn dat voor twee rabauwen?
Stevenijne antwoordde:
--Truwanten, die men niet slecht zou doen van elkander te scheiden,
in stede van hen hier al dat gedruisch te laten maken, vóór zij naar
't galgeveld trekken.
--Als hij zich vermeet ons te scheiden, sprak Uilenspiegel, hameren
wij met zijnen kop op de vloersteenen.
--Ja, op de vloersteenen, bevestigde Lamme.
--De baas komt ons redden, fluisterde Uilenspiegel tot Lamme.
De baas, die eene of andere geheimenis ried, wierp zich tusschen
de vechters.
Lamme zei hem in der haast deze woorden in 't oor:
--Komt gij ons redden? Hoe dat?
De baas gebaarde dat hij Uilenspiegel duchtig bij de ooren trok,
en fluisterde hem toe:
--Zeven voor u ... sterke mannen, beenhouwers.... Ik ga weg ... te
zeer gekend in de stad.... Als ik weg ben, is 't tijd van te beven
den klinkaard.... Alles aan stukken slaan....
--Goed, zeide Uilenspiegel, die zich oprichtte en den baas eenen
schop gaf.
Maar de baas gaf hem eenen schop terug en eenen slag daarbij. En
Uilenspiegel zei hem:
--Gij slaat dapper, kameraad.
--Ja, ze vallen als hagelsteenen, niet waar, antwoordde de baas, die
meteen vlug de tassche uit Lamme's handen rukte en ze aan Uilenspiegel
teruggaf.
--Daar, rabauw, sprak hij, trakteer mij, nu gij terug in 't bezit
van uw goed zijt.
--Zuip maar op, schandalige dieper, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Hoor eens hoe stout hij is, sprak Stevenijne.
--Zoo stout als gij schoon zijt, lievelinge, antwoordde Uilenspiegel
met een spottenden glimlach.
Nu, Stevenijne was diep in de zestig en had een gezicht als eene
mispel, doch 't was nu geel van toorn en gramschap. In 't midden
stond een neus, die geleek op den bek van een uil. Zij had oogen
lijk die van een vrek, zonder glans van min of van vriendschap. Twee
lange, puntige tanden staken uit haren mageren mond met zijn dunne,
kleurlooze lippen. En een groote roode vlek bemorste hare linkerwang.
De meidekens lachten, spotten met haar en zeiden:
--Lievelinge, lievelinge, geef hem te drinken!--Hij zal u kussen en
streelen.--Hoelang is het geleden, dat gij samen voor de eerste maal
paardet?--Pas op, Uilenspiegel, zij gaat u verscheuren.--Bezie hare
oogen, zij flikkeren, maar 't is van haat en niet van liefde.--Zou men
niet zeggen, dat zij lust heeft tot bijten?--Wees niet bevreesd.--Al
de vrouwen, die oprecht beminnen, doen zooals zij.--Zij wil slechts
uw goed.--Zie eens hoe 't lachen haar in goede luim heeft gebracht!
En, inderdaad, Stevenijne lachte, doch knipoogde intusschen tot
Gilline, de deerne met heur goudlinnen kleed.
De baas dronk, betaalde en vertrok.
De zeven beenhouwers deden teeken van verstandhouding tot de serjanten
en tot Stevenijne.
Een van de zeven maakte een gebaar om te bedieden, dat hij Uilenspiegel
voor een onnoozele hield en dat hij hem leelijk ging beethebben.
En in Uilenspiegel's oor zeide hij, terwijl hij spottend de tong
uitstak naar Stevenijne, die lachte en heure tanden liet zien:
--'t Is van te beven den klinkaard!
Vervolgens, naar de serjanten wijzend, sprak hij luidop:
--Lieve hervormde, wij zijn allen met u, trakteer ons met eten
en drinken.
En Stevenijne lachte van plezier en stak ook heure tong uit naar
Uilenspiegel, toen deze met zijnen rug naar heur was gekeerd.
En Gilline, de deerne met heur goudlinnen kleed, stak insgelijks
heure tong uit naar Uilenspiegel.
En de meidekens zeiden tot elkander:
--Ziet die verklikster, die den Spanjaard aanhangt en die, door
heure schoonheid, meer dan zeven en twintig hervormden naar de wreede
pijnbank en naar den nog wreederen marteldood bracht. Zie, Gilline
is buiten zich zelve van vreugde; zeker denkt ze aan het geld, dat
zij als aanbrengster krijgt,--de eerste honderd karolusgulden op de
nalatenschap der slachtofferen. Maar zij lacht niet, want zij denkt
er aan, dat zij met Stevenijne moet deelen.
En allen, serjanten, beenhouwers en meidekens, staken hunne tong uit
om te spotten met Uilenspiegel.
En Lamme zweette water en bloed; hij was van gramschap zoo rood als
de kam van een haan, doch hij wilde niet spreken.
--Komaan, trakteer ons met eten en drinken, zeiden de beenhouwers en
de serjanten.
--Wel, sprak Uilenspiegel, terwijl hij zijne karolussen opnieuw deed
rinkelen, geef ons te eten en te drinken, beminnelijke Stevenijne,
geef ons te drinken in glazen, die klinken.
Op die rede lachten de meidekens opnieuw en stak Stevenijne heure
scherpe tanden weer uit.
Maar ze ging toch naar de keuken en naar den kelder, en ze kwam
terug met hesp, met worsten, met pannekoeken van zwarte pensen en
met klinkaards: dat zijn glazen met een voet, aldus geheeten omdat
zij klinken lijk de beiaard, als men ze tegeneen stoot.
Uilenspiegel zei toen:
--Dat zij eten, die honger hebben, en drinken, die dorst hebben!
En serjanten, meidekens, beenhouwers, Gilline en Stevenijne klapten
in de handen en trapten met de voeten. Ieder zette zich neer waar
hij plaats vond: Uilenspiegel, Lamme en de zeven beenhouwers aan de
groote eeretafel, de serjanten en de meidekens aan twee kleine tafelen.
En men at en men dronk met een luidruchtig geknauw, tot zelfs de
twee serjanten, die buiten stonden en die door hunne gezellen werden
binnengeroepen om deel te nemen aan het festijn.
En uit hunne gordeltasschen zag men koorden en kettingen steken.
Stevenijne liet hare tanden zien, en grinnikend sprak zij:
--Niemand zal hier uitgaan, vóór ik betaald ben.
En al de deuren ging zij vast doen; en de sleutelen stak zij in
heure tassche.
Gilline stak heur glas omhoog en sprak:
--Laat ons drinken, de vogel is gevangen!
Bij die rede zeiden twee meidekens, Gena en Greta, tot heur:
--Gaat gij dien ook al ter dood brengen, wreedaardige beulin?
--Laat mij gerust, zei Gilline, laat ons drinken!
Maar de twee meidekens wilden niet klinken met heur.
En Gilline nam heure vedel en zong:
    Op de vedel zing ik geerne,
      Op de vedel nacht en dag.
    Ik ben de dartele deerne
      Die leef van minnegelag.
    Venus mijn heupen maakte,
      Vlammend als van een elf;
    Wit zijn mijn schouders, de naakte,
      Mijn lijf is de godheid zelf.
    Laat uit den buidel klinkelen
      Kronen met hellen klank.
    Laat een goudstroom ruischen en rinkelen
      Geel om mijn voeten blank.
    Ik ben van Eva's geslachte,
      Door Satan, den feilen held.
    Geen vreugdbron lokt uw gedachte
      Die niet in mijn herte welt.
    'k Ben koud en gloeiend samen,
      Teeder, wankel, of stil,
    Flauw, lauw, heet in 't verzamen,
      Willig, man, naar uw wil.
    Zie mijn schoonheid veil, mijn blikken,
      Mijn oogen, blauw en rood,
    Mijn lachjes, tranen en snikken,
      En zoo ge 't zoekt, den Dood.
    Op de vedel zing ik geerne,
      Op de vedel nacht en dag.
    Ik ben de dartele deerne
      Die leef van minnegelag.
En terwijl Gilline zong, was ze zóó bevallig, zóó betooverend schoon,
dat al de mannen, serjanten, beenhouwers, Lamme en Uilenspiegel,
verteederd, glimlachend, als overwonnen, sprakeloos bleven zitten.
Eensklaps schoot Gilline in een luiden schaterlach en, Uilenspiegel
beziende, sprak ze:
--Zóó is 't dat men vogelen vangt!
En heure tooverkracht was verdwenen....
Uilenspiegel, Lamme en de zeven sterke beenhouwers bezagen malkander.
--Nu, gaat ge mij betalen? sprak Stevenijne, gaat ge mij betalen,
messire Uilenspiegel, die teert en smeert met het geld van de
predikantjes?
Lamme wilde spreken, doch Uilenspiegel deed hem zwijgen en zei tot
Stevenijne:
--Ik ben niet gewoon op voorhand te betalen.
--Dan zal ik mij naderhand doen betalen op uwe nalatenschap, zeide
Stevenijne.
--Hyena's leven van lijken, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Ja, sprak een van de serjanten, die twee diepers hebben 't geld van
de predikanten genomen: meer dan driehonderd karolusgulden. Daar zal
een goede stuiver voor Gilline afmogen.
Deze zong:
    Zoek elders zoeter blikken,
      Neem alles, mijn lief genoot,
    Vreugden, kussen, en snikken,
      En, zoo ge 't wilt, den Dood.
En toen riep ze, grijnslachend:
--Laat ons drinken!
De serjanten antwoordden:
--Laat ons drinken!
--Bij God! zei Stevenijne, laat ons drinken! De deuren zijn vast,
de vensteren zijn van stevige ijzeren staven voorzien: de vogelen
zijn gevangen; laat ons drinken!
--Laat ons drinken! zei Uilenspiegel.
--Laat ons drinken! zei Lamme.
--Laat ons drinken! zeiden de zeven beenhouwers.
--Laat ons drinken! zeiden de serjanten.
--Laat ons drinken! zei Gilline, die de snaren heurer vedel
tokkelde. Ik ben schoon, laat ons drinken! Den aartsengel Gabriël
zou ik vangen in de netten van mijn lied!
--Laat ons dan maar drinken, riep Uilenspiegel. Breng wijn op, om het
feest te bekronen, en wèl van den besten! Dat onze dorstige lichamen
van het hoofd tot de voeten doortrokken wezen van het vurige sap van
den wijngaard!
--Laat ons drinken! sprak Gilline, een grondeling, als gij, is den
heekt wel een hap weerd.
Stevenijne bracht bottels wijn op.
De serjanten en de meidekens zaten samen, en dronken en zwolgen. De
zeven beenhouwers, die aan de tafel van Lamme en Uilenspiegel zaten,
smeten van hunne tafel naar die van de meidekens hespen, worsten,
pannekoeken en bottels, die zij vingen in de vlucht, gelijk de karpers
boven het water naar de vliegen snappen. En Stevenijne liet heure
scherpe tanden zien en grijnslachte, en wees naar de pakken keersen
van vijf in het pond, die boven den toog hingen. Het waren de keersen
van de meidekens.
Vervolgens sprak zij tot Uilenspiegel:
--Men gaat naar den brandstapel met eene vetkeers in de hand; wilt
gij er reeds eene hebben?
--Laat ons drinken! zei Uilenspiegel.
--Laat ons drinken! zeiden de zeven.
Gilline sprak:
--Evenals die van eenen zwaan, dien de dood nabij is, flikkeren
Uilenspiegel's oogen lijk perelen.
--Perelen, die wij voor de verkens zullen smijten, sprak Stevenijne
met wrok in het herte.
--Nu, dit ware zoo ongewoon niet: er zijn meer zeugen, die perelen
dragen; laat ons drinken! antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Wat zoudt gij zeggen, vervolgde Stevenijne, als men u op de pijnbank
legde en daarna uwe tong met een gloeiend ijzer doorboorde?
--Dat ik dan beter zou kunnen schuifelen: Laat ons drinken! antwoordde
Uilenspiegel opnieuw.
--Ge zoudt zooveel praat niet maken als gij gehangen werdt, sprak
Stevenijne, en uwe lievelinge zou komen zien hoe gij het stelt.
--Ja, sprak Uilenspiegel, maar ik weeg nogal zwaar, en licht kon het
gebeuren, dat ik op uw goddelijk wipneusje bonsde: laat ons drinken!
--Wat zoudt gij zeggen zoo gij gekortoord werd, en op het voorhoofd
en op den schouder met eenen sleutel gebrandmerkt?
--Ik zou zeggen, dat men een verkeerd beest heeft genomen, antwoordde
Uilenspiegel, en dat men, in stee van met de zeug Stevenijne, met
den beer Uilenspiegel bezig is: laat ons drinken!
--Mits gij van al die lieve dingen niet houdt, sprak Stevenijne, zult
gij gebracht worden op de galeien des konings, en daar gevierendeeld
worden.
--Wel, sprak Uilenspiegel, dan zullen mijne vier deelen in de zee
gesmeten worden om den haaien te dienen tot voedsel, en wat zij
overlaten is voor u, mijn hertje: laat ons drinken!
--Eet liever, sprak zij, eet liever deze keersen, zij zullen u dienstig
zijn in de helle, om uw eeuwige verdoemenis te verlichten.
--Ik zie klaar genoeg om uw lichtenden snoet te onderscheiden,
o slecht gebrande zeug, hernam Uilenspiegel.
Eensklaps sloeg hij met den voet van zijn glas op de tafel, daarbij
bootste hij, met de handen, 't gerucht na, dat de tapijtsiers maken
als zij wolle op eene horde uitkloppen, doch hij deed het stilletjes
en zei op de maat:
--'t Is van te beven den klinkaard!
In Vlaanderen was dit het teeken, dat de drinkers kwaad werden. Op
dit teeken werd gemeenlijk alles kort en klein geslagen in de huizen
met roode lanteerne.
Uilenspiegel dronk, tikte met zijn glas op de tafel en sprak:
--'t Is van te beven den klinkaard!
En de zeven deden als hij.
Allen hielden zich stille: Gilline verbleekte, Stevenijne scheen
verrast en onthutst.
De serjanten vroegen tot elkaar:
--Zouden die zeven met hen zijn?
Maar de beenhouwers knipoogden om hen gerust te stellen, terwijl zij
gedurig luider en luider zeiden met Uilenspiegel:
't Is van te beven den klinkaard! 't Is van te beven den klinkaard!
Stevenijne dronk mee, om zich een hert onder den riem te steken.
Toen sloeg Uilenspiegel met de vuist op de tafel, op de maat van
de tapijtsiers, die wolle kloppen; de zeven deden als hij: glazen,
kruiken, schalen, pinten en bekers begonnen te dansen, stieten tegen
elkander, braken, sprongen van den eenen kant weder recht om van den
anderen weer neder te vallen.
En altijd weerklonk meer en meer dreigend en vervaarlijk, het
krijgszuchtig en eentonig referein:
--'t Is van te beven den klinkaard!
--Laas! zuchtte Stevenijne, zij gaan hier alles aan stukken slaan!
En de schrik deed heure scherpe tanden nog langer uitsteken dan
gewoonte.
En, van woede en grammoedigheid begon het bloed van de zeven en van
Lamme en Uilenspiegel meer en meer te koken.
En, zonder hun eentonig en dreigend gezang te staken, namen al die
van Uilenspiegel's tafel hunne glazen en bekers en braken zij dezelve
op de tafel, op de maat der tapijtsiers. Vervolgens zetten zij zich
te peerd op hunne stoelen en trokken zij hunne kruismessen uit.
En zij maakten zulk een gedruisch met hun lied, dat al de ruiten van
het huis aan 't rinkelen gingen.
Vervolgens stormden zij, als uitzinnige duivelen, op hunne stoelen,
rond de kamer en om de tafelen, terwijl zij aanhoudend riepen:
--'t Is van te beven den klinkaard!
En bevend van schrik stonden de serjanten toen recht en haalden
zij hunne koorden en kettingen uit. Maar de beenhouwers en Lamme en
Uilenspiegel staken hunne kruismessen in de scheeden, grepen hunne
stoelen in de hand, zwaaiden ermede als knuppels, liepen aldus de kamer
rond en sloegen, in't wilde, alles aan stukken en brokken. Alleen de
meidekens werden ontzien, doch huisraad, schapraaien, ruiten en pinten,
glazen en schalen, bottels en flesschen werden aan stukken geslagen,
ook de serjanten kregen ruimschoots hun deel, altijd op de maat van
de tapijtsiers, die wolle kloppen:
--'t Is van te beven den klinkaard! 't Is van te beven den klinkaard!
Intusschen had Uilenspiegel eenen vuistslag gegeven op Stevenijne's
neus en hare sleutels uit heure tassche genomen, en nu wilde hij met
alle geweld haar heure keersen doen eten.
De schoone Gilline krabde, als eene verschrikte kattin, met heure
nagelen aan deuren, ramen, ruiten en vensteren, om ergens een uitweg
te vinden. Vervolgens ging zij, bleek als de dood, in eenen hoek op
heure hurken zitten, met heure vedel vóór zich, alsof deze heur had
moeten beschermen.
De zeven en Lamme zeiden tot de verschrikte meidekens:
--U zullen wij geenerlei leed doen.
En, geholpen door heur, bonden zij, met koorden en kettingen,
de serjanten, die beefden als riet en niet dorsten wederstaan,
daar zij wel voelden, dat de beenhouwers--die de weerd uit de Bie
onder de sterksten gekozen had--hen met hunne kruismessen in stukken
hadden gekapt.
En, naarmate Uilenspiegel met geweld Stevenijne keersen deed eten,
sprak hij:
--Deze is voor de pijne der galge; deze voor de kortooring; nog eene
voor de brandmerking; deze hier voor de tongboring; kom, hier nog twee
dikke vette voor de galeien des konings en voor de vierendeeling;
deze is voor uwe spelonk van spionnen; deze is voor uwe deerne met
heur goudlinnen kleed; en al deze hier voor mijn eigen rekening.
En de meidekens proestten van 't lachen, als ze Stevenijne hoorden
niezen van gramschap en zagen hoe zij bovenmatige pogingen inspande om
de keersen uit te spuwen. Maar te vergeefs, want heur mond was te vol.
Uilenspiegel, Lamme en de zeven anderen hielden niet op met zingen
op maat:
--'t Is van te beven den klinkaard!
Vervolgens scheidde Uilenspiegel uit, en deed hij hun teeken het
referein zachtjes te mompelen. Zulks deden zij, terwijl hij tot de
serjanten en meidekens sprak:
--Als een uwer zich vermeet om hulp te roepen, wordt hij onmiddellijk
gekeeld.
--Gekeeld! bevestigden de beenhouwers,
--Wij zullen zwijgen, maar doe ons geen leed, Uilenspiegel, zeiden
de meidekens.
Doch Gilline, die met uitpuilende oogen, met toegebeten tanden,
op de hurken in heuren hoek zat, kon niet spreken en prangde heure
vedel tegen heure borst.
En de zeven murmelden altijd op maat:
--'t Is van te beven den klinkaard!
Stevenijne wees met den vinger naar de keersen, die in haren mond
staken, om te bedieden dat zij ook zwijgen zou. De serjanten beloofden
zulks insgelijks.
Uilenspiegel vervolgde zijne rede en sprak:
--Gij zijt hier allen in onze macht; 't is donker, de nacht is
gevallen, wij zijn hier dicht bij de Leie, in dewelke men lichtelijk
verdrinkt, vooral als men daartoe door flinke gasten wordt geholpen.
--De poorten van Kortrijk zijn lang reeds gesloten. Als de nachtwacht
het gedruisch gehoord heeft, zal zij zich niet verroeren, want zij
is er te lui voor. Ook meent zij, dat het goede Vlamingen zijn, die
blijde drinken en zingen bij 't gerinkel van bottels en glazen. Houdt
u dus koest en luistert naar de bevelen van uwe meesters.
Toen vroeg hij tot de zeven:
--Gaat gij naar Petegem bij de Geuzen?
--Ja; wij hebben onze toebereidselen gemaakt, zoodra wij hoorden,
dat gij naar de stad kwaamt.
--Van daar gaat gij naar de zee?
--Ja, zeiden zij.
--Kent gij onder die serjanten een of twee, die men zou mogen loslaten,
om ons te dienen?
--Ja, zeiden ze, twee, Nicolaas en Judocus, die nimmer de arme
hervormden hebben vervolgd.
--Wij zijn getrouw! riepen Nicolaas en Judocus.
Toen sprak Uilenspiegel:
--Hier hebt gij twintig karolusgulden, tweemaal meer dan gij hadt
ontvangen als eerloozen prijs uwer aanklacht.
Plotseling riepen de vijf andere:
--Twintig gulden! Voor twintig gulden willen wij ook den prins
dienen. De koning betaalt slecht. Geef ons enkel de helft van die som,
en wij vertellen aan den rechter al wat gij wilt.
De beenhouwers en Lamme herhaalden gezamenlijk, met een dof gemurmel:
--'t Is van te beven den klinkaard! 't Is van te beven den klinkaard!
--Opdat gij uwe tong niet zoudt voorbijklappen, sprak Uilenspiegel,
zullen de zeven u gekneveld en gebonden naar Petegem brengen, bij de
Geuzen. Gij zult tien gulden hebben als gij op zee zult zijn; op die
manier zijn wij zeker, dat de keuken van 't kamp u bijhoudt. Als gij
dient als dappere soldaten, krijgt gij uw deel van de buit. Als gij
beproeft te ontsnappen wordt gij gehangen. Als gij ontsnapt, om de
koorde te ontloopen, valt gij gewis op het mes.
--Wij dienen, die ons betaalt, zeiden zij.
Lamme en de zeven sloegen op de tafels met scherven van potten en
pinten en bekers, en spraken:
--'t Is van te beven den klinkaard! 't Is van te beven den klinkaard!
--Gilline, Stevenijne en drie deernen zult gij insgelijks medenemen,
vervolgde Uilenspiegel. Als een van heur poogt te ontsnappen, naait
gij ze in eenen zak en smijt ze in de Leie.
--Hij heeft mij niet gedood, kreet Gilline, uit heuren hoek springend
en met heure vedel zwaaiend.
En zij zong:
    Bloedig was de gedachte
    Die nog mijn hart ontstelt.
    Ik ben van Eva's geslachte
    Door Satan, den fellen held.
Stevenijne en de anderen zetten een gezicht alsof zij in tranen
gingen uitbarsten.
--Vreest niets, mijne liefsten, sprak Uilenspiegel, gij zijt zoo zoet
en zoo zacht, dat men u overal zal minnen, vieren en streelen. Bij
elke bemachtiging, door onze legers gedaan, krijgt gij ook uw deel
van den buit.
--Ik, ik zal niemendal krijgen, ik ben reeds te oud, sprak Stevenijne
krijtend.
--Eén stuiver daags zult gij krijgen, sprak Uilenspiegel, want gij
zult de dienaresse dezer vier schoone deernen wezen. Gij zult heure
rokken, kleeren en hemden wasschen.
--Ik, Heere God? riep zij.
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Lang genoeg hebt gij heure meesteresse gespeeld, lang genoeg
hebt gij rijkelijk geleefd op heur lijf, terwijl gij ze in armoede
en ontbering liet sukkelen. Nu moogt gij schreeuwen en ruchelen,
't is vergeefs. Zooals ik zeg, zal geschieden.
Daarop schoten de vier meidekens in eenen schaterlach; ze begonnen
met Stevenijne te lachen en zeiden, terwijl zij spottend de tong naar
heur uitstaken:
--Elk zijne beurt op de wereld. Wie had dat gedacht van de gierige
Stevenijne? Zij zal voor ons werken als onze dienstmeid. Gezegend
zij onze heer, gezegend zij Uilenspiegel!
Vervolgens zei Uilenspiegel tot de zeven beenhouwers en tot Lamme
Goedzak:
--Ledigt de wijnkelders, neemt al het geld; het zal dienen tot het
onderhoud van Stevenijne en de vier meidekens.
--Zij knarsetandt, de gierige Stevenijne, zeiden de meidekens. Gij
waart hard jegens ons, nu is men het ook jegens U. Gezegend zij onze
heer, gezegend zij Uilenspiegel!
En de drie deernen wendden zich tot Gilline:
--Gij waart heure dochter, heure broodwinster, zeiden zij, met heur
deeldet gij de vruchten van uw eerloos spionbedrijf. Zoudt gij ons
nog durven slaan en beleedigen, met uwe goudlinnen kleeren? Voor
ons koesterdet gij niets dan verachting, omdat wij maar bombazijn
droegen. Als gij zoo schoon gekleed waart, was het alleen met den
prijs van het bloed uwer slachtofferen. Wij zullen heur kleed van
heur lijf rukken, opdat zij onze gelijke zou wezen.
--Dat zal ik niet dulden, sprak Uilenspiegel.
En Gilline vloog hem om den hals en sprak blijde:
--Gezegend zijt gij, die mij spaart van den dood en niet duldt dat
ik leelijk weze!
En de afgunstige meidekens bezagen Uilenspiegel en spraken tot
elkander:
--Hij is zot van haar, evenals de anderen.
Gilline nam heure vedel en zong een liedeken van vurige minne.
De zeven vertrokken naar Petegem, langsheen de Leie, en leidden de
serjanten en de meidekens mede.
Onderweg murmelden zij:
--'t Is van te beven den klinkaard! 't Is van te beven den klinkaard!
Met den dageraad kwamen zij nabij het kamp. Zij zongen als de
leeuwerik en het gekraai van den haan antwoordde hun. De meidekens
en de serjanten werden van dichtbij bewaakt.
Edoch, den derden morgen werd Gilline dood gevonden: in heur hert
stak een groote naald.
Stevenijne werd door de drie meidekens beschuldigd en gebracht voor den
bentkapitein, zijne tiendeniers en serjanten, in verschaar vergaderd.
Daar bekende zij, zonder dat men heur op de pijnbank moest leggen, dat
zij Gilline gedood had uit afgunst op heure schoonheid en uit woede,
omdat de deerne heur zonder mededoogen als eene dienstmeid behandelde.
En Stevenijne werd gehangen en vervolgens begraven in het bosch.
Gilline werd ook begraven, en men las de gebeden der dooden over heur
liefelijk lichaam.
Doch de twee serjanten Judocus en Nikolaas, dien Uilenspiegel de
les had gespeld, waren vóór den kastelein van Kortrijk verschenen,
want het gedruisch, het geweld en de plundering moesten door hem
gestraft worden, daar het huis van Stevenijne in de kasselrij, buiten
den bijvang der stad Kortrijk lag. Nadat zij aan den kastelein het
gebeurde hadden verteld, zeiden zij hem met de innigste overtuiging
en de nederigste oprechtheid:
--De moordenaars van de predikanten zijn geenszins Uilenspiegel
en zijn trouwe vriend Lamme Goedzak, die maar naar den Regenboog
gekomen waren om zich te vermaken. Zij hebben zelfs reispassen van den
hertog en wij hebben die met eigen oogen gezien. De twee schuldigen
zijn twee kooplieden van Gent, een magere en een heel dikke, die naar
Frankrijk getogen zijn, nadat zij alles aan stukken hebben geslagen bij
Stevenijne, dewelke zij medegenomen hebben met heure vier meidekens,
voor hun pleizier. Wij hadden ze wel bij den kraag gepakt, doch daar
waren zeven beenhouwers in het kot, van de sterksten der stad, die
voor de booswichten aantrokken. Zij hebben ons allen gekneveld en ons
maar losgelaten als zij verre in Frankrijk waren. Hier ziet gij nog
het merk van de koorden. De vier andere serjanten zijn achter hunne
hielen, en wachten op versterking, om de hand op hen te leggen.
De kastelein gaf hun elk twee karolussen en een nieuw kleed, als
belooning voor hun trouwe en eerlijke diensten.
Vervolgens schreef hij naar den raad van Vlaanderen, naar de
schepenbank van Kortrijk en naar andere vierscharen om hun kond te
doen, dat de ware moordenaars ontdekt geweest waren.
En hij legde de zaak uiteen van 't begin tot het einde.
Dat deed al die van den Raad van Vlaanderen en van de smalle
vierscharen sidderen en beven.
En de kastelein werd om zijne scherpzinnigheid geloofd en geprezen.
En Uilenspiegel en Lamme gingen ongehinderd op den weg van Petegem
naar Gent, langsheen den oever der Leie; van deze laatste stede zouden
zij zich begeven naar Brugge, alwaar Lamme zijn vrouw hoopte weder
te vinden, en naar Damme, alwaar Uilenspiegel reeds had willen zijn,
om Nele te zien, die treurig leefde bij de uitzinnige Katelijne.
XXXVI.
Sedert lang werden er, in het land van Damme en in de omstreken,
afschuwelijke gruweldaden gepleegd.
Meidekens, jonge knapen, oude mannen, die met geld naar Gent, Brugge
of andere steden of dorpen van Vlaanderen waren gegaan, werden dood
gevonden op den weg, naakt als pieren, den hals doorgebeten met zulke
lange en scherpe tanden, dat het nekbeen van allen gebroken was.
De geneesheeren en de chirurgijns-baardemakers verklaarden, dat het
tanden waren van een grooten wolf.
--Dieven waren ongetwijfeld gekomen na den wolf, en hadden den
slachtofferen geld en kleederen afgenomen, zeiden zij.
Verscheidene aanzienlijke poorters, die zich kloekmoedig zonder
geleide op weg hadden begeven, verdwenen zonder dat men wist wat zij
geworden waren, behalve dat men nu en dan eens een landbouwer, die
's morgens naar zijn akker ging, wolvesporen vond in zijn kouter,
terwijl zijn hond met de pooten de aarde openkrabde en een armzalig,
naakt lijk ontblootte, waarop men, in den nek of onder het oor, de
tanden van den wolf zag, en menigwerf ook in de beenen, doch altijd
van achteren. En altijd was het nekbeen gebroken.
De ontstelde boer ging dan schielijk kennis geven van zijne akelige
vondst aan den baljuw, die met zijn griffier-crimineel, twee schepenen
en een chirurgijn-baardemaker, ter plaatse kwam, waar het lijk des
vermoorden lag. Na een neerstig en zorgvuldig onderzoek, lukte het hun
soms, als het gezicht niet afgeknaagd was door de wormen, den stand,
zelfs den naam en den toenaam van den verslagene te ontdekken.
Doch ze waren ten zeerste verwonderd, dat de wolf, die uit honger
slechts menschen aanvalt, nooit het kleinste stuk uit het lijk had
gebeten.
En die van Damme waren met schrik bevangen en dorsten 's nachts zonder
goed geleide niet meer uitgaan.
Eindelijk toch werden verscheidene kloekmoedige soldaten uitgezonden om
den wolf op te sporen, met bevel hem te zoeken, bij dag en bij nacht,
in het duin, langsheen de zee.
Toen waren ze omtrent Heist, in het groot duin. De nacht was
gevallen. Een der soldaten, vol vertrouwen op zijne kracht, wilde hen
verlaten, om alleen op zoek te gaan, gewapend met zijne bus. De anderen
lieten hem gaan, overtuigd als zij waren dat hij, een kloekmoedig
en goed gewapend soldaat, den wolf zou dooden, als deze zich dorst
laten zien.
Toen hun gezel vertrokken was, staken zij een groot vuur aan, bij
hetwelk zij zich zetten te spelen met dobbelsteenen, en brandewijn
te drinken.
En van tijd tot tijd riepen zij luide:
--Nu, kameraad, kom maar terug; de wolf heeft schrik; kom, drink
eenen slok.
Doch hij antwoordde niet.
Eensklaps hoorden zij een grooten schreeuw, als 't gereutel van een
man, die gekeeld wordt, en terstond liepen zij naar den kant van
denwelken het geschreeuw kwam.
En zij riepen:
--Verweer u kloekmoedig, wij komen u ter hulp!
Maar 't duurde tamelijk lang, voordat zij hunnen makker vonden, want
sommigen vermeenden, dat de kreet uit het dal, anderen dat hij van
de hoogste duin was gekomen.
Toen zij dal en duin met hunne lanteernen goed afgezocht hadden,
vonden zij eindelijk hunnen gezel, van achteren gebeten in den arm
en in het been en met gebroken nek, lijk de andere slachtofferen.
Hij lag op den rug, met zijn zweerd in de toegenepen hand; zijne bus
lag op het zand. Naast hem waren drie afgesneden vingeren, die de zijne
niet waren, en die zij meedroegen. Zijne gordeltasch was hem ontnomen.
Zij namen het lijk van hunnen gezel op de schouderen; zijn flink
zweerd en zijn dappere bus droegen zij insgelijks mede, en, grammoedig
en jammerend, droegen zij het lijk naar het baljuwschap, alwaar de
baljuw het ontving, bijgestaan door zijnen griffier-crimineel, door
twee schepenen, alsmede door twee chirurgijns.
De afgesneden vingeren werden onderzocht en bevonden als zijnde die van
eenen ouderling, dewelke van geenerlei ambacht kon zijn, want zij waren
dun en fijn, en de nagelen lang, lijk die van rechters en geestelijken.
's Anderen daags gingen de baljuw, de schepenen, de griffier, de
chirurgijns en de soldaten naar de plaats, waar de arme doode gebeten
was, en zij zagen bloeddroppelen op het gras, en stappen die gingen
tot aan de zee, waar zij ophielden.
XXXVII.
Het was in den tijd der rijpe druiven, de vierde dag van de Wijnmaand,
als wanneer men te Brussel, na de hoogmis, van op Sint-Nicolaastoren,
zakken okkernoten te grabbel smijt.
Des nachts werd Nele gewekt door kreten, die kwamen van de straat. Zij
zocht Katelijne in de kamer, maar vond ze niet. Zij liep naar beneden
en opende de deur, en Katelijne kwam haastiglijk binnen en sprak:
--Red mij! red mij! De wolf! de wolf!
En Nele hoorde, van verre in het veld, een akelig, schor
gehuil. Sidderend stak zij al de lampen en keersen aan, die zij vond.
--Wat is er gebeurd, Katelijne? vroeg zij, heur in de armen drukkend.
Katelijne zette zich neer op eenen stoel, en, met verwilderde oogen,
zeide zij, terwijl zij de keersen aanstaarde:
--Dat is de zonne, die de booze geesten verdrijft. De wolf, de wolf
huilt in de verte.
--Maar, zeide Nele, waarom zijt gij uit uw bed gekomen, waar gij warm
laagt, om koorts op te doen in de vochtige najaarsnachten?
En Katelijne sprak:
--Hansken schreeuwde daar even als de nachtuil; en ik heb de deur
opengedaan. En hij zei tot mij: "Drink den tooverdrank"; en ik
dronk. Hansken is schoon. Doe het vuur weg. Toen bracht hij mij dicht
bij de vaart en zeide hij mij: "Katelijne, ik zal u de zevenhonderd
karolussen teruggeven, gij zult ze geven aan Uilenspiegel, zoon
van Klaas. Hier zijn twee karolussen voor u, koop er een kleed mee,
weldra zult gij er duizend hebben".--"Duizend, sprak ik, mijn beminde,
dan zal ik rijk zijn".--"Gij zult ze hebben, sprak hij. Maar zijn er
in Damme geene vrouwen of meidekens, die nu zoo rijk zijn als gij dan
zult wezen?"--"Ik weet het niet", antwoordde ik. Ik wilde heure namen
niet zeggen, uit vreeze dat hij ze zou beminnen. Toen zeide hij mij:
"Tracht dit te weten te komen en zeg mij heure namen als ik terugkom".
...Het was koud, de mist hing over de weide, droge takjes vielen van
de boomen op den weg. En de maan glom, en er waren lichtjes op het
water van de vaart. Hansken zeide mij: "'t Is nacht van de weerwolven;
dezen nacht mogen alle schuldige zielen uit de helle komen om op de
wereld te wandelen. Gij moet driemaal het teeken des kruises met de
linkerhand maken en roepen: "Zout! zout! zout!" dat het zinnebeeld is
van onsterfelijkheid; en zij zullen u geenerlei leed doen". En ik zei:
"Ik zal doen wat gij wilt, Hansken, mijn geliefde".--Hij omhelsde mij
en sprak: "Gij zijt mijn gade".--"Ja", sprak ik. En bij zijn zoete
woorden viel een hemelsch geluk als een balsem over mijn lichaam. Hij
kroonde mij met rozen en sprak: "Gij zijt schoon". En ik zeide hem:
"Gij ook zijt schoon, Hansken, mijn geliefde, met uw fijne kleederen
van groene panne met gouden belegsels, met uw lange struisveeren, die
wuiven op uw toque en met uw bleek gezicht, dat lijkt op de branding
der zee. En als de meidekens van Damme u zagen, zouden allen achter u
loopen, om u uw herte te vragen; maar gij moogt het slechts geven aan
mij, Hansken".--Hij sprak: "Tracht te weten te komen wie de rijksten
zijn, haar fortuin is voor u". Toen vertrok hij, na mij verboden te
hebben hem te volgen of te vergezelschappen. Bibberend van koude,
nat van den mist, bleef ik staan, terwijl ik de twee karolussen in
mijne hand deed rammelen, toen eensklaps een wolf met groenen muil
en lange lischblaren in zijn wit haar, den oever van de vaart opklom
en naar mij kwam. Ik riep: "Zout! zout! zout!" en maakte driemaal
het teeken des kruises, doch daar scheen hij geenszins schrik voor
te hebben. En ik liep uit al mijne macht, al schreeuwend, terwijl
hij achter mij huilde, en ik hoorde het klapperend geluid zijner
tanden achter mij, en eenmaal dit zóó dicht tegen mijne schouderen,
dat ik dacht dat hij mij vastgrijpen ging. Maar ik liep gauwer dan
hij. Tot mijn groot geluk kwam ik aan den hoek van de Reigerstraat
den nachtwacht met zijne lanteerne tegen. "De wolf! de wolf!" riep
ik. "Wees niet bevreesd, sprak de nachtwacht tot mij, ik zal u naar
huis leiden, uitzinnige Katelijne". En ik voelde dat zijne hand,
die de mijne vasthield, insgelijks beefde. En hij ook was bevreesd.
--Maar reeds heeft hij weer moed gevat, sprak Nele. Hoor, daar zingt
hij met slepende stemme: "De klok slaat tien, tien slaat de klok!" En
hij draait met zijnen ratel.
--Doe het vuur weg, sprak Katelijne; mijn hoofd brandt. Kom terug,
Hansken, mijn liefste!
En Nele keek droevig naar Katelijne; en zij bad Onze-Lieve-Vrouwe,
de Heilige Moeder Gods, dat zij het vuur der uitzinnigheid uit heur
hoofd zou wegnemen; en zij weende over heur.
XXXVIII.
Te Bellem, aan den oever van de Brugsche vaart, kwamen Uilenspiegel
en Lamme eenen ruiter tegen, met drie haneveeren op zijn vilten hoed,
en die spoorslags naar Gent reed. Uilenspiegel zong als de leeuwerik
en de ruiter hield zijn peerd in, en antwoordde met Kanteklaar's
helder gekraai.
--Brengt gij tijdingen mede, onstuimige ruiter? vroeg Uilenspiegel.
--Gewichtige tijdingen, antwoordde de ruiter. Op raadgeving van
mijnheer de Châtillon, die in Frankrijk admiraal is, heeft de
prins kaperbrieven uitgegeven; buiten de vaartuigen van Emden en
Oost-Friesland, worden allerwegen oorlogsschepen uitgerust. De dappere
mannen, die de brieven ontvingen, zijn: Adriaan van Bergen, heer van
Dolhain; de baron de Montfaucon, Lodewijk van Brederode; Albrecht van
Egmond, zoon van den gehalsrechte en geen verrader lijk zijn broeder;
Berthold Enthens van Mentheda, de Fries; Adriaan Menningh, Hembyse,
de trotsche, vurige Gentenaar, alsmede Jan Brock.
... De prins heeft heel zijn vermogen gegeven, over de vijftigduizend
gulden.
--Ik heb er vijfhonderd voor hem, sprak Uilenspiegel.
--Draag ze naar de zee, sprak de ruiter.
En hij reed weg op een draf.
--Hij geeft heel zijn vermogen, zeide Uilenspiegel. Wij, wij hebben
slechts ons lijf en geven het geerne.
--En heet gij dat niets, vroeg Lamme, en zullen wij altijd leven
tusschen rooven en moorden? Oranje is ten gronde.
--Ja, sprak Uilenspiegel, ten gronde evenals de eik; maar met eikenhout
bouwt men schepen voor de vrijheid!
--Tot zijn profijt, sprak Lamme. Maar, nu alle gevaar verdwenen is,
konden wij ezelen koopen, dunkt mij. Ik zit nog al geerne op mijn gemak
als ik reis, en ben geen liefhebber van veeren op mijne voetzolen.
--Wij zullen langooren koopen, zeide Uilenspiegel; die kunnen wij
steeds verkoopen zonder verlies.
Zij trokken naar de merkt en kochten er twee schoone ezelen met het
noodige tuig.
XXXIX.
Schrijlings op hunne rijdieren gezeten, kwamen zij te Oostkamp,
alwaar een groot bosch is, hetwelk aan de vaart paalt.
Op zoek naar lommer en naar liefelijke geuren, traden zij er in,
zonder iets anders te zien dan lange dreven, die in alle richtingen
naar Gent, Brugge, Zuid- en Noord-Vlaanderen liepen.
Eensklaps sprong Uilenspiegel van zijnen ezel.
--Ziet gij daar niets?
Lamme sprak:
--Ja, ik zie iets.
En bevend vervolgde hij:
--Mijne vrouw, mijn goede vrouw! Zij is het, mijn vriend. Ha! ik zal
naar heur niet kunnen loopen. Wie had ooit gedacht, dat ik heur aldus
zou terugvinden?
--Waarover klaagt gij? sprak Uilenspiegel. Zij is schoon, zoo
half naakt, in dat uitgebekt neteldoeksch wambuis, dat heur vel
zoo liefelijk doet uitkomen. Die vrouw is te jong, zij kan de uwe
niet wezen.
--Mijn vriend, sprak Lamme, zij is het, mijn vriend; ik herken
ze. Draag mij, ik kan niet meer gaan. Wie had dit van heur
gedacht? Alzoo dansen, in Egyptische deerne verkleed, zonder
schaamte! Ja, zij is het; zie maar heur schoone beenen, heur tot den
schouder ontbloote armen, heur ronde lichtbruine borsten, die half
uitkomen uit heur neteldoeksch wambuis. Zie eens hoe zij dien grooten
hond plaagt met een rood vlaggetje, en hoe hij er naar toe springt.
--'t Is een Egyptische hond, zeide Uilenspiegel; die soort hoort niet
te huis in de Nederlanden.
--Of het een Egyptische hond is, weet ik niet juist.... Maar zij
is het.... Ha! mijn vriend, ik sta het niet langer uit. Zij licht
heur kleed nog hooger op, om heur ronde beenen nog hooger te laten
zien. Zij lacht om heur witte tanden te toonen, en schatert om den
klank heurer zoete stem te laten hooren. Zij opent heur wambuis
van boven en werpt zich achterover. Ha! die zwanenhals, die bloote
schouderen, die heldere en stoutmoedige oogen! Ik loop er naar toe!
En hij sprong van zijnen ezel.
Doch Uilenspiegel hield hem tegen en sprak:
--Dat meideken is uwe vrouw niet. Wij zijn omtrent een kamp
van Egyptenaren. Pas op. Ziet gij den rook tusschen de boomen
opstijgen? Hoort gij 't geblaf van de honden? Zie maar: hier zijn
er eenigen, die ons bezien en misschien lust gevoelen om ons te
bijten. Laat ons terugkeeren, Lamme.
--Ik wil niet terugkeeren, sprak Lamme, die vrouw is de mijne; zij
is uit Vlaanderen vandaan lijk wij.
--Waanzinnige blinde! zei Uilenspiegel.
--Maar ik ben niet blind, sprak Lamme. Ik zie ze, half naakt, dansen,
lachen en joelen met dien hond. Zij gebaart mij niet te zien. Maar
ik verzeker u dat zij ons ziet. Thijl! Thijl! zie, de hond werpt zich
op heur en smijt ze ten gronde, om het roode vlaggetje te hebben. En
zij valt met een smertvollen kreet.
En eensklaps vloog Lamme er naar toe, zeggende:
--Mijne vrouw, mijne vrouw! Waar hebt gij zeer, mijne liefste? Waarom
berst gij in eenen schaterlach uit? Uw oogen staan verwilderd in
uw hoofd.
En hij kuste, streelde heur, en sprak:
--Dat geboortevlekje, dat gij onder den linkerboezem hadt, zie ik
niet! Waar is het? Zoudt gij mijne vrouw niet wezen? God van den
hoogen hemel!
En zij hield op met lachen.
Eensklaps riep Uilenspiegel:
--Pas op, Lamme.
En Lamme keerde zich om, en zag een grooten duivel van een Egyptenaar
met een mager gezicht vóór zich staan, die bruin was als peperkoek.
Lamme raapte zijnen stok op, stelde zich te weer en riep:
--Ter hulp, Uilenspiegel!
Uilenspiegel was daar met zijn kruismes.
De Egyptenaar zei hem in het Hoogduitsch:
--Gieb mir Geld, einige Thaler.
--Zie, sprak Uilenspiegel, het meideken gaat schaterlachend henen en
keert zich gedurig om, opdat men heur volge.
--Gieb mir Geld, sprak de man. Betaal uwe minnarijen. Wij zijn arm
en willen u geen kwaad.
Lamme gaf hem eenen karolus.
--Welk bedrijf voert gij uit? vroeg Uilenspiegel.
--Alle bedrijven, antwoordde de Egyptenaar: zeer bedreven in de
goochelkunst, doen wij wonderbare en bovennatuurlijke toeren. Wij
spelen op de tamboerijn en dansen Hongaarsche dansen. Onder ons zijn
er, die schoone vogelkooien maken en anderen die roosters verveerdigen
om vleesch op te braden. Doch allen, Vlamingen als Walen, zijn bevreesd
voor ons en jagen ons weg. Daar wij niets kunnen verdienen, zijn wij
wel gedwongen, groenten, vleesch en kiekens bij de boeren te stelen,
vermits zij ons die niet willen geven of laten verdienen.
Lamme vroeg hem:
--Van waar komt dat meideken, dat zoo goed op mijne vrouw trekt?
--Dat is de dochter van onzen hoofdman, antwoordde de zwerver.
Vervolgens zeide hij stiller, als iemand, die vreest dat men hem
zou afluisteren:
--Zij werd door God getroffen met minnekwaal en kent niets van
de vrouwelijke eerbaarheid. Zoodra zij eenen man ziet, wordt zij
blijgeestig en minziek, en lacht zij gedurig. Zij is weinig van
zeggen; langen tijd meenden wij dat zij doof was. 's Nachts blijft
zij in alleenigheid vóór het vuur; soms zit zij te weenen, of zonder
reden te lachen, en wijst zij naar heuren buik, waar zij zeer heeft,
naar zij zegt. 's Zomers, rond het middaguur, na het eten, is ze 't
ergst gefolterd door heure kwaal. Dan gaat ze, schier teenemaal naakt,
dansen omtrent het kamp. Zij wil niets anders dragen dan kleederen
van gaas of van neteldoek, en 's winters hebben wij alle moeite om
heur een opperste kleed van geitenlaken te doen omslaan.
--Maar, sprak Lamme, heeft zij dan geen enkelen vriend om haar te
beletten aldus aan een iegelijk heur lichaam ten beste te geven?
--Neen, sprak de man, zij geeft geenerlei vriend, want als de
wandelaars, die zij tot zich lokt, heur waanzinnige oogen zien,
krijgen zij meer schrik dan liefde voor heur. Die dikke man was
tamelijk stout, sprak hij, naar Lamme wijzend.
Lamme fronste de wenkbrauwen, bij die toespeling op zijne dikte.
--Laat hem maar zeggen, Lamme; 't is de sprot, die kwaad spreekt van
den walvisch.
--Gij zijt spotziek, dezen morgen, sprak Lamme.
Doch zonder te luisteren, vervolgde Uilenspiegel tot den zwerver:
--Wat doet zij, als anderen zoo stout zijn als mijn vriend Lamme?
De Egyptenaar antwoordde droefgeestig:
--Dan heeft zij genot en profijt. Zij die heur krijgen, betalen hun
pleizier, en het geld dient om heur te kleeden en ook tot de behoeften
der grijsaards en vrouwen.
--Zij gehoorzaamt dus aan niemand? vroeg Lamme.
De bruine man antwoordde:
--Laat hen, die God treft, hun zin doen. Aldus beduidt hij zijnen
wil. En zijn wil is onze wet.
Uilenspiegel en Lamme vervolgden hunnen weg naar Brugge. En de
Egyptenaar ging ernstig en fier terug naar het kamp. En het meideken
danste, schaterlachend, in een opene plaats van het bosch.
XL.
Onderweg sprak Uilenspiegel tot Lamme:
--Wij hebben reeds schrikkelijk veel geld uitgegeven: wij hebben
huurlingen aangeworven, den serjanten eene belooning gegeven,
een karolus aan dat Egyptisch meideken geschonken; voeg daarbij de
ontelbare oliekoeken, die het u beliefde zonder ophouden zelf te eten,
liever dan er éénen te verkoopen. Nu, niettegenstaande het verzet van
uwen buik, wordt het hoog tijd dat wij ons met minder generen. Geef
mij uw geld: ik zal de gemeenschappelijke beurs houden.
--Ik wil wel, sprak Lamme.
Hem de beurs langend, sprak hij:
--Laat mij evenwel niet sterven van honger; want bedenk toch: dik en
struisch als ik ben, moet ik kloek en overvloedig voedsel hebben. Dat
is goed voor u, die mager en schraal zijt, van onbekommerd te leven,
onverschillig of gij eten vindt of niet, lijk de planken op de kaaien,
die leven van regen en lucht. Doch ik, dien de lucht en de regen
hongerig maken, ik hoef andere festijnen.
--Gij zult ze hebben, die festijnen, maar 't zullen festijnen zijn
van een deugdzame vasten. De best gevulde buiken zijn daartegen niet
bestand; zij nemen langzamerhand af en maken de zwaartste mannen
als een vlinder zoo licht. En weldra zal men Lamme, mijnen vriend,
genoegzaam ontvet, zien loopen als een hert,
--Laas! sprak Lamme, zou dit voortaan mijn armzalig lot moeten
wezen? Ik heb honger, mijn vriend, en zou willen eten.
De avond viel. Zij kwamen te Brugge langs de Gentpoort. Zij toonden
hunne passen. Toen zij een halven stuiver voor zich en twee stuivers
voor hunne ezelen hadden betaald, traden zij de stad binnen.
Lamme dacht gedurig aan de woorden van Uilenspiegel en was diep
nedergeslagen.
--Zullen wij haast avondmalen? sprak hij.
--Ja, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
Zij stapten af in de Meermin, afspanning, die van verre kennelijk was
door de gouden meermin, die, als windwijzer, bovenop den trappengevel
stond.
De beide wandelaars brachten hunne ezelen op stal, en Uilenspiegel
bestelde brood, bier en kaas voor hun avondmaal.
De weerd grijnslachte bij het opdienen van dien schamelen
maaltijd. Lamme at met lange tanden, en zag vertwijfeld naar
Uilenspiegel, die het oudbakken brood en de te jonge kaas
binnenspeelde alsof hij ortolanen at. En Lamme dronk zijn dun bier
zonder genoegen. Uilenspiegel lachte in zich zelven als hij hem
zoo jammerend zag zitten. En daar was nog iemand, die lachte in het
binnenhof van de afspanning, en die van tijd tot tijd den neus voor
het venster kwam steken. Uilenspiegel zag dat het eene vrouw was, die
heur aangezicht verborg. In den waan dat het een oolijke dienstmaagd
was, hield hij er zich niet verder mede bezig, te meer daar hij, naar
Lamme kijkend, zag dat zijn vriend bleek, treurig en troosteloos was
ter oorzake van zijne tegengewerkte liefde voor lekkere spijzen en
dranken. Hij kreeg medelijden met hem en meende voor zijn gezel een
pannekoek met pensen, eene pateel ossenvleesch met boonen of een ander
warm gerecht te bestellen, toen de weerd binnenkwam en beleefdelijk
sprak, met zijne muts in de hand:
--Als die doorluchtige heeren een beter avondmaal wenschen, moeten
zij maar spreken en zeggen wat hun zal believen.
Lamme sperde de oogen wijd open en den mond nog wijder, en bezag
Uilenspiegel met angstige onrust.
Deze antwoordde:
--Reizende werklieden hebben geen gouden karolussen te vereten.
--Toch gebeurt het somtijds, sprak de baas, dat zij niet weten wat
zij bezitten....
En, naar Lamme wijzend, vervolgde hij:
--Die goede tronie is er twee andere weerd. Wat zouden die doorluchtige
heeren gelieven te eten en te drinken? een pannekoek met vette, lekkere
hesp? Soezels?--wij hebben er dezen avond gereedgemaakt. Krakelingen,
een kapoen, die zoo malsch is dat hij smelt in den mond? Geurige
karbonaden met saus, bereid met de vier specerijen? Antwerpsche
dobbelen knol, Brugsche dobbele kuite, Leuvenschen wijn bereid naar
de wijs van Bourgondië? En dit alles zonder een duit te betalen.
--Breng dan maar alles op, sprak Lamme.
Weldra stond de tafel gedekt en schepte Uilenspiegel er oprecht
vermaak in den armen Lamme bezig te zien, die, hongeriger dan ooit,
beurtelings alle gerechten aanviel: den pannekoek, de soezels,
den kapoen, de hesp, de karbonaden, en heele stoopen dobbelen knol,
dobbele kuite en Leuvenschen wijn, bereid naar de wijs van Bourgondië,
door zijn keelgat zond.
Toen Lamme zijne bekomst had, blies hij lijk een walvisch van genoegen;
en hij keek rondom zich op de tafel om te zien of er niets meer te
peuzelen viel. En zorgvuldig snoepte hij de brokken der krakelingen.
Hij noch Uilenspiegel hadden het lieve gezichtje gezien, dat in het
binnenhof, glimlachend voor de ruiten kwam lonken. De baas had warmen
wijn opgebracht, die met kaneel en Madeira-suiker gekookt was. En de
beide vrienden dronken en zongen.
Bij de slaapklok, vroeg de baas of zij ieder naar hun groote, schoone
kamer wilden gaan.
Uilenspiegel zeide, dat een klein kamertje voldoende was voor hun
tweeën.
De baas antwoordde:
--Kleine kamerkens heb ik niet; gij zult elk eene heerenkamer hebben,
zonder een duit te betalen.
En, inderdaad, hij bracht hen naar rijk gestoffeerde kamers met
prachtige meubelen. In die van Lamme stond een groot bed.
Uilenspiegel, die veel gedronken had en viel van den vaak, liet hem
slapen gaan en deed als hij.
's Anderen daags, rond den middag, trad hij in de kamer zijns vriends
en vond hem nog in zijne koets aan 't ronken. Naast hem lag een fijn
geborduurde beugeltasch. Hij opende die en zag dat ze met gouden
karolussen en zilveren oortjes gevuld was.
Hij schudde Lamme om hem wakker te maken; deze schoot uit zijn slaap,
wreef zich de oogen en, ongerust rondom zich kijkend, vroeg hij:
--Mijne vrouw? Waar is mijne vrouw?
En, naar de ledige plaats naast zich in het bed wijzend, sprak hij:
--Straks was ze daar nog.
Hij sprong vervolgens uit zijn bed en keek opnieuw overal rond, in
alle hoeken en kanten der kamer, in de alkoof, tot in de schapraaien.
Stampvoetend herhaalde hij:
--Mijne vrouw? Waar is mijne vrouw?
De baas kwam boven, op 't gerucht dat hij maakte.
--Deugniet, riep Lamme, den weerd bij de keel grijpend, deugniet,
waar is mijne vrouw? Wat hebt gij gedaan met mijne vrouw?
--Driftige kerel, zeide de baas, uwe vrouw? Welke vrouw? Gij zijt
hier alleen gekomen. Ik weet niet wat ge vertelt.
--Ha! hij weet het niet, hij weet het niet, sprak Lamme, die opnieuw
al de hoeken en kanten der kamer afzocht. Laas! Daar, in mijn bed,
was zij dezen nacht, als in den schoonen tijd onzer liefde. Ja,
waar zijt ge, mijn hertje?
En, de beurze ten gronde smijtend, vervolgde hij:
--'t Is uw geld niet, dat ik hebben moet; 't is u, 't is uw liefelijk
lichaam, uw schoonen boezem, 't is uw hert, mijne welbeminde! O,
genuchten des hemels, zult gij nooit meer terugkomen? Ik had er mij
aan gewend te leven zonder u te zien, te leven zonder liefde, mijn
hertediefje. En nu verlaat gij mij opnieuw, na mij uw zoete kussen
te hebben laten smaken. Maar ik zal het besterven! Mijne vrouw! Waar
is mijne vrouw?
En hij lag te snikken ten gronde. Doch eensklaps vloog hij naar de
deur; hij stormde de trap af, en liep in zijn hemd de afspanning door,
tot op de straat, al roepend:
--Mijne vrouw? waar is mijne vrouw?
Maar hij kwam dadelijk terug, want de straatjongens jouwden hem uit
en smeten met steenen naar hem.
En Uilenspiegel zeide tot hem:
--Kleed u, Lamme, en wees niet wanhopend, gij zult ze terugzien,
vermits gij ze heden gezien hebt. Zij mint u nog immer, vermits
zij bij u is teruggekomen, vermits zij het waarschijnlijk is,
die het lekkere maal van gisteravond en de heerenkamers betaald,
en deze volle beurze op het bed gelegd heeft. De assche zegt mij,
dat dit het werk niet is van een ontrouwe vrouw. Ween niet meer,
en laat ons gaan voor het heil van den grond onzer vaderen.
--Laat ons te Brugge blijven, zei Lamme; ik zal heel de stad afloopen,
en zal ze wel vinden.
--Gij zult ze niet vinden, daar zij zich voor u verbergt, sprak
Uilenspiegel.
Lamme vroeg inlichtingen aan den baas, doch deze wilde niets zeggen.
En zij togen naar Damme.
Onderwege sprak Uilenspiegel tot Lamme:
--Waarom vertelt gij mij niet, hoe gij ze dezen nacht nevens u vondt
en hoe zij u verliet?
--Mijn vriend, antwoordde Lamme, gij weet dat wij gisterenavond
gegastreerd hebben met vleesch, met bier en met wijn, en dat ik met
moeite kon blazen, toen ik de trap opklom om te slapen. Om mij te
lichten hield ik, als een groot heer, eene waskeers in mijne hand,
en om te slapen had ik den kandeleer op eene schapraai gezet; de deur
was tegenaan en de schapraai stond dicht bij de deur. Terwijl ik mij
ontkleedde, bezag ik mijn bed met genoegen, want ik had grooten vaak;
de waskeers werd eensklaps uitgeblazen. Ik hoorde als een ademtocht
lichte stappen in mijne kamer; doch mits ik meer vaak had dan schrik,
liet ik mij vallen in 't bed. Ik ging slaap vatten, toen eene stem,
heure stem, o mijne vrouw, mijn arme vrouwe, mij vroeg: "Heeft het
avondmaal gesmaakt, Lamme?" en heure stem was dicht tegen mij en heur
aangezicht ook, en heur liefelijk lichaam.
XLI.
Dien dag had koning Philippus te veel lekkernijen gegeten en was
hij naargeestiger dan gewoonte. Hij had op zijn levende klavecimbel
gespeeld, eene kist waar katten in waren, dewelke heuren kop door
ronde gaten staken, boven de toetsen. Telkens dat de koning op eene
toets sloeg, sloeg deze op hare beurt de kat met eenen schicht; en het
dier mauwde erbarmelijk, ter oorzake van de smert, die het uitstond.
Doch Phillippus lachte niet.
Gedurig zocht hij in zijnen geest hoe hij Elisabeth, de groote
koningin, zou kunnen overwinnen om Maria Stuart terug op den troon
van Engeland te plaatsen. Met dat doel had hij eenen brief geschreven
aan den Paus, dewelke diep in schulden stak; de Paus had geantwoord
dat hij, voor die onderneming, geerne de heilige vaten der tempels
en de schatten van het Vatikaan zou verkocht hebben.
Maar Philippus lachte niet.
Ridolfi, de lieveling van koningin Maria, die heur wilde verlossen
in de heimelijke hoop naderhand met heur te trouwen en koning van
Engeland te worden, kwam bij Philippus om met hem Elisabeth's dood
te beramen. Maar hij had zulke lange tong, lijk de koning naderhand
schreef, dat men ter Beurze van Antwerpen openlijk van zijn voornemen
gesproken had; en de moord werd niet bedreven.
En Philippus lachte niet.
Later zond de bloedige hertog, op bevel van den koning, vier
moordenaars naar Engeland. Zij slaagden er slechts in, zich te
doen hangen.
En Philippus lachte niet.
En aldus verijdelde God de heerschzuchtige plannen van dien
bloedzuiger, wiens voornemen was Maria Stuart heuren zoon te ontnemen
en in zijne plaats, samen met den Paus, over Engeland te regeeren. En
de moordenaar was verbitterd, omdat dit edele land zoo groot en zoo
machtig was. Gedurig wendde hij zijn bleeke oogen naar hetzelve,
en zocht hij het middel om het te verpletten, om vervolgens over de
wereld te regeeren, de hervormden uit te roeien, en liefst nog de
rijke, en have en goed te erven van de slachtofferen.
Maar hij lachte niet.
En men bracht hem ratten en muizen in een ijzeren doos met hooge
randen, open van boven; en hij stelde de doos met den bodem op een
gloeiende stoof en hij schepte er vermaak in, de arme diertjes te
zien en te hooren springen, schreeuwen, zuchten en sterven....
Maar hij lachte niet.
Vervolgens ging hij, met bleek gezicht en bevende handen, in de
armen van mevrouw van Eboli, zijn vuur van geilheid blusschen, dat
aangestoken was met de toorts van de wreedheid.
En hij lachte niet.
En mevrouw van Eboli ontving hem, uit vrees en geenszins uit liefde.
XLII.
De lucht was warm: van de kalme zee woei geen het minste
windeken. Nauwelijks trilden de bladeren der boomen aan de vaart van
Damme; de krekelen bleven in de meerschen, terwijl, in de velden,
de bedienden der kerken en abdijen het dertiende van de oogsten
ophaalden, ten profijte van papen en abten. Uit de hoogte van den
vurigen, diepen, blauwen hemel overstroomde de zonne het aardrijk
met haar gloed, en de Natuur sliep onder de zonnestralen als een
dartel meideken, dat trilt onder de kussen van beuren geliefde. De
karpers sprongen boven het water naar de vliegen, die gonsden als
een kokende ketel, terwijl de zwaluwen, met heur lang lijf en groote
vleugelen, hun hunne prooi betwistten. Uit de aarde steeg een warme,
vochtige damp omhoog, die schitterde in 't licht. Van op den toren
van Damme liet de koster, door middel eener gebarsten klok, die klonk
als een ketel, den veldarbeiders weten dat het middag was, en tijd om
te gaan eten. De vrouwen brachten heure twee handen trechtergewijze
aan heuren mond om heure mannen en broeders te roepen: Hans, Pieter,
Dokus; en boven de menigte zag men heure roode huiken uitsteken.
Lamme en Uilenspiegel zagen, in de verte, den hoogen, vierkanten,
zwaren toren van Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk verrijzen.
Lamme sprak:
--Daar, mijn zoon, daar zijn uwe smerten en uwe minne.
Doch Uilenspiegel antwoordde niet.
--Weldra, sprak Lamme nogmaals, zijn wij aan mijn oude woning en wie
weet of ik daar mijne vrouw niet zie.
Doch Uilenspiegel antwoordde niet.
--Houten man, zeide Lamme, steenen hert, kan niets u dan bewegen,
noch de nadering van het plekje, waar gij leefdet als kind, noch de
dierbare schimmen van den armen Klaas en de arme Soetkin, de beide
martelaren? Hoezoo! gij zijt weemoedig noch blijde van zin; wie dan
heeft aldus alle gevoel uit uw herte gerukt? Aanschouw mij, zie hoe de
angst, de aandoening mijn hert in mijnen buik doen schokken; bezie mij.
Lamme keek op naar Uilenspiegel; hij zag hem met een bleek gezicht,
met gebogen hoofd, met trillende lippen, sprakeloos weenen.
En hij zweeg.
Zonder nog een woord te wisselen, reden zij voort naar Damme;
zij kwamen de stad langs de Reigerstraat binnen, doch zij zagen
niemand, ter oorzake van de hitte. De honden lagen op hunne zijde,
met hangende tong, voor de zullen der deuren. Lamme en Uilenspiegel
gingen dicht tegen het Schepenhuis, rechtover hetwelk Klaas verbrand
werd; Uilenspiegel's lippen beefden heviger, doch hij weende niet
meer. Toen hij noesch over het huis kwam van Klaas, dat nu bewoond
was door een meester-koolbrander, ging hij er binnen, zeggende:
--Herkent gij mij? Hier wil ik rusten.
De meester-koolbrander sprak:
--Ik herken u; gij zijt de zoon van het slachtoffer. Doe alsof gij
thuis waart in deze halle.
Uilenspiegel ging in de keuken, vervolgens in de kamer van Klaas en
van Soetkin en weende.
Toen hij terug beneden was, zeide de meester-koolbrander tot hem:
--Hier is brood, kaas en bier. Eet als gij honger, drink als gij
dorst hebt.
Uilenspiegel deed teeken met de hand, dat hij honger noch dorst had.
Toen ging hij voort met Lamme, die schrijlings op zijnen ezel bleef,
terwijl Uilenspiegel den zijnen bij den halster geleidde.
Zij kwamen aan de hut van de uitzinnige Katelijne, bonden hunne ezelen
vast en gingen binnen. Het was het etensuur. Op de tafel stond eene
pateel prinsessenboonen, ondereengestoofd met boerenteenen. Katelijne
was aan 't eten, terwijl Nele recht stond met de sauspan in de hand,
gereed om saus te gieten in Katelijne's teil.
Toen Uilenspiegel binnentrad, was zij zoo ontroerd, zoo aangedaan,
dat zij de sauspan met heel den inhoud in de teil van Katelijne
liet vallen. De uitzinnige schuddebolde, zocht met heuren lepel de
boerenteenen uit, rondom de sauspan; zij sloeg op heur voorhoofd
en sprak:
--Doe het vuur weg! mijn hoofd brandt.
De reuk van de azijnsaus streelde Lamme's neus; de dikke man was in
verzoeking gebracht.
Uilenspiegel bleef staan en, in zijn groote droefheid, bezag hij Nele
met een teederen, liefderijken glimlach.
En zonder een woord tot hem te richten, vloog Nele hem om den hals. Zij
ook scheen waanzinnig; zij weende, lachte, en zeide enkellijk,
blozend van zoet en innig genoegen:
--Thijl! Thijl!
Uilenspiegel, gelukkig, kon zijne oogen niet wenden van zijne geliefde,
die zich eensklaps zachtjes losmaakte en eenen stap achteruitweek,
om hem beter te bezien; en opnieuw vloog zij blijde om zijnen hals en
drukte hem tegen heure borst, en dit herhaalde reizen achtereen. Zalig
van geluk, hield hij ze vast, zonder van heur te kunnen scheiden,
totdat zij, moede en als waanzinnig, op eenen stoel nederviel; en
zonder verlegenheid zeide zij:
--Thijl! Thijl! mijn geliefde, ge zijt dus terug!
Lamme stond nog steeds nabij de deur; toen Nele's aandoening een
weinig gestild was, bemerkte zij hem en sprak zij:
--Waar heb ik dien dikzak nog gezien?
--Het is mijn vriend, antwoordde Uilenspiegel. In mijn gezelschap
zoekt hij zijn wettige vrouw.
--Nu herken ik u, zeide Nele tot Lamme; gij hebt gewoond in de
Reigerstraat. Gij zoekt uwe vrouw; ik heb ze gezien te Brugge, alwaar
zij godvruchtig en devotelijk leeft. Ik heb heur gevraagd waarom zij
zoo wreedelijk heuren man had verlaten, en zij gaf mij tot antwoord:
"Dus was de heilige wil Gods, maar voortaan mag ik met hem niet
meer wonen".
Lamme werd droevig gestemd bij die rede en keek begeerig naar de
prinsessen met azijnsaus. En de leeuweriken zongen en verhieven
zich hoog in den hemel en de smachtende Natuur liet zich kussen door
het warme zonnelicht. En Katelijne stak met heuren lepel, rondom de
sauspan naar de boerenteenen en naar de prinsessen.
XLIII.
Omtrent dien tijd ging een meideken van vijftien jaar alleen in vollen
dag van Heist naar Knokke, langs het duin. Niemand koesterde de minste
vrees voor heur, want men wist, dat weerwolven en verdoemde zielen
alleen uitgaan en bijten des nachts. Zij droeg, in eene tassche,
acht en veertig zilveren stuivers, wat vier karolusgulden uitmaakt,
die heure moeder Tonia Pietersen, woonachtig te Heist, schuldig was,
wegens eene verkooping, aan heuren oom Jan Rapen, woonachtig te
Knokke. Het meideken, Betkin genaamd, had heure beste kleederen aan,
en was blij te moede vertrokken.
's Avonds was Betkin nog niet thuis en heure moeder werd ongerust;
doch daar zij ten slotte onderstelde, dat ze bij heuren oom was
gebleven, bedaarde zij.
Visschers die, met een goede vangst van de zee kwamen, trokken 's
anderen daags hunne boot op het strand, en losten hunne visch in
karren om ze aan de meestbiedenden te doen verkoopen te Heist, in de
mijn. Zij klommen den weg in het schelpzand op, en vonden, in het duin,
een naakt meideken liggen, dat gansch uitgeschud was, tot zelfs van
heur hemde ontdaan, en rondom heur lag bloed. Nader gekomen, zagen zij,
in heuren armen gebroken nek, het merk van lange, scherpe tanden. Het
slachtoffer lag op den rug, met de oogen wijd open naar den hemel,
met den mond insgelijks open, alsof het nog om hulp wou roepen.
Zij bedekten het lichaam van het meideken met een opperste kleed en
droegen het naar Heist, naar het Schepenhuis. Weldra kwamen aldaar
de schepenen en de chirurgijn-baardemaker bijeen, dewelke laatste
verklaarde, dat die lange tanden geenszins wolfstanden waren, zooals
de Natuur die gemaakt heeft, maar wèl die van een boozen, helschen
weerwolf, en dat men God diende te bidden om Vlaanderenland van dat
gedrocht te verlossen.
En, heel het graafschap door, en vooral te Damme, Heist en Knokke,
werden openbare gebeden bevolen.
En men zag het volk jammerend de kerken afloopen.
En in de kerk van Heist, in dewelke het lijk van het meideken ten
toon gesteld was, schreiden mannen en vrouwen, als zij den bloedigen,
verscheurden nek van het slachtoffer zagen.
En de moeder zei in de kerk zelve:
--Ik wil naar den weerwolf gaan en hem vaneenscheuren met mijne tanden.
En weenend hitsten de vrouwen heur in heur voornemen op. Sommigen
zeiden nochtans:
--Gij zoudt niet levend terugkomen.
En zij ging met heuren man en heure beide broeders--alle vier goed
gewapend--den wolf zoeken langs strand, duin en dal, maar zij vonden
hem niet. En heur man moest heur terugbrengen naar huis, want door
de nachtelijke koude had zij de koorts gekregen; en zij waakten bij
heur bed terwijl zij hunne netten herstelden.
Overwegende, dat de weerwolf een beest is dat leeft van bloed, doch
geenszins de dooden besteelt, meende de baljuw van Damme, dat het
ondier zekerlijk moest gevolgd zijn door diepers, die, voor hun snood
gewin, rondzwierven langs het strand. Dienvolgens liet hij uitbellen,
dat hij een iegelijk gelastte en beval, goed gewapend met bussen,
stokken en anderszins, op zoek te gaan, en alle schooiers en diepers
te vatten en af te tasten, om te zien of in hunne gordeltasschen
geen gouden karolussen staken of geenerlei stuk van de kleeding van
de slachtofferen. En nadien zouden de gezonde en sterke schooiers
en diepers op de galeien des konings worden gebracht. En de oude en
gebrekkelijke zou men laten gaan.
Doch men vond niets, dat licht in de zaak bracht.
Uilenspiegel ging tot den baljuw en sprak:
--Ik wil den weerwolf dooden.
--Wat geeft u vertrouwen? vroeg de baljuw.
--De assche klopt op mijn hert, antwoordde Uilenspiegel. Geef mij de
toelating in de gemeentesmidse te werken.
--Gij moogt, sprak de baljuw.
Zonder tot een man of eene vrouw van Damme een woord over zijn ontwerp
te spreken, trok Uilenspiegel naar de smidse en verveerdigde daar,
in 't geheim, eene schoone en groote val om wilde dieren te vangen.
Den volgenden dag, een Zaterdag, de geliefkoosde dag van de weerwolven,
toog Uilenspiegel henen met eenen brief van den baljuw voor den
parochiepaap van Heist, en met de val onder zijnen mantel; overigens
was hij gewapend met een goede bus en een scherp, versch aangezet
kruismes; in 't heengaan zei hij tot die van Damme:
--Ik ga op jacht naar de meeuwen en zal met haar dons oorkussens
maken voor mevrouw van den baljuw.
Naar Heist stappend, langs het duin, hoorde hij de woedende baren
der zee, die schuimend kwamen botsen op de kust, met een gedruisch
als van den donder, en den wind, die uit Engeland woei en die huilde
in het want van de gestrande schuiten.
Een schipper zei tot hem:
--Die kwade wind doet ons nadeel. Verleden nacht was de zee kalm,
doch na zonsopgang rees zij eensklaps woedend omhoog. Wij zullen niet
kunnen in zee steken.
Uilenspiegel was er blijde om, want aldus was hij zeker des nachts
hulp te krijgen, als zulks noodig mocht zijn.
Te Heist ging hij naar den pastoor, denwelken hij den brief van den
baljuw bestelde.
De parochiepaap zeide tot hem:
--Gij zijt een moedige kerel; edoch ik moet u zeggen, dat niemand
's Zaterdagavonds langs het duin gaat, zonder gebeten, en dood in
het zand gevonden te worden. De dijkwerkers en andere arbeidslieden
wachten steeds op elkaar en begeven zich maar bij troepen op weg. De
avond valt. Hoort gij in het duin den weerwolf huilen? Zal men weeral,
lijk gisteren, heel den nacht door, zijn schor gehuil hooren weergalmen
op den akker der dooden? God zij met u, mijn zoon, maar doe het niet.
En de paap maakte het teeken des kruises, en zegende hem.
--De assche klopt op mijn hert, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
De pastoor sprak:
--Mits gij zoo'n kloekmoedige wilskracht hebt, zal ik u helpen.
--Heer pastoor, sprak Uilenspiegel, gij zoudt mij en het arme
geteisterde land grootelijks van dienst zijn, zoo gij bij Tonia, de
moeder van het slachtoffer, en ook bij heure twee broeders wildet
gaan, en hun zeggen, dat de wolf in de nabijheid is en dat ik hem
wil afwachten om hem te dooden.
De parochiepaap sprak:
--Als gij niet weet welken weg gij moet nemen, begeef u op dien, welke
leidt naar het kerkhof. Hij loopt tusschen twee groene hagen. Twee
mannen zouden er naast elkander niet kunnen gaan.
--Daar zal ik zijn, antwoordde Uilenspiegel. En gij, messire dappere
pastoor, gelast en beveel aan de moeder van het meideken, aan heuren
man en aan heure broeders zich, vóór de slaapklok, goed gewapend
in de kerk te bevinden. Als zij mij hooren fluiten lijk de meeuw,
is dit het teeken, dat ik den weerwolf gezien heb. Dan moeten zij
de wacharmklok luiden en mij ter hulp snellen. Hebt gij ook eenige
andere wakkere mannen?
--Neen, mijn zoon, antwoordde de pastoor. De visschers vreezen den
weerwolf meer dan pest en dan dood. Maar doe het niet....
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--De assche van Klaas klopt op mijn hert.
Toen zei de paap:
--Ik zal doen wat gij vraagt, wees gezegend. Hebt gij soms honger
of dorst?
--Beide, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
De pastoor gaf hem bier, brood en kaas.
Uilenspiegel at en dronk; en hij toog henen.
Onderwege hief hij de oogen op; hij zag Klaas, zijn vader, in
glorie naast God in den hemel, in denwelken de heldere maan glom,
en vervolgens zag hij naar de zee en de wolken, en hoorde hij den
loeienden wind, die uit Engeland blies.
--Laas! sprak hij, zwarte wolken, die voorbijrennen in het nachtelijk
duister, weest als de Wrake die den Moord achternazet. Loeiende zee,
pikdonkere hemel; bruisend water, dat driftig, grammoedig rolt of
woest omhoog slaat, of in branding schuimend en spattend breekt op
het strand; zwarte zee, in rouw gehulde hemel, komt mij ter hulp in
mijnen strijd tegen den weerwolf, den vuigen moordenaar van onschuldige
meidekens. En gij, wind, die klagend huilt in de bremstruiken van
het duin en in het want van de schepen, gij zijt de stem van de
slachtofferen, die roepen om wrake bij den Heer, dewelke mij helpe
in mijne onderneming!
En waggelend op zijne beenen, alsof zijn hoofd honderd pond woog en
zijne maag overlast was, daalde hij neer van het duin.
Wankelend stapte hij voort met een slepend lied op de lippen, dat
hij elk oogenblik onderbrak om te hikken, te geeuwen, te spuwen. Van
tijd tot tijd bleef hij staan en gebaarde hij over te geven, doch
in werkelijkheid opende hij goed de oogen, om rondom zich alles
oplettend gade te slaan. Eensklaps hoorde hij een schor geluid; hij
bleef staan om te spugen als een hond, en, bij het licht der rijzende
maan, onderscheidde hij de gedaante van eenen wolf, die sloop naar
het kerkhof.
Waggelend sloeg Uilenspiegel het pad in, tusschen de groene hagen. Daar
gebaarde hij neder te vallen, doch 't was om de val te plaatsen langs
den kant, van denwelken de wolf kwam: hij wapende vervolgens zijne
bus en ging tien stappen verder staan in de houding eens dronkaards,
en gedurig veinsde hij te waggelen, te hikken, te braken, doch
werkelijk spande hij zijnen geest als een boog, opende de oogen en
spitste de ooren.
En niets zag hij dan de zwarte wolken, die als waanzinnig renden
door 't luchtruim, en een dikke korte en zwarte gedaante, die op hem
afkwam; en niets hoorde hij dan de wind, die kreunend huilde, de zee,
die als de donder rolde, en den weg van schelpzand, die kraakte onder
een zwaren, huppelenden stap.
Uilenspiegel veinsde zich te willen nederzetten en liet zich, als
een dronkaard, zwaar op den weg vallen. En hij braakte.
Daar hoorde hij ijzerwerk knarsen, op een paar stappen van zich,
dadelijk daarna het gerucht van de val, die toesloeg, en den gil van
een mensch.
--De weerwolf, sprak hij bij zich zelven, is met de voorpooten gevangen
in de val. Huilend richt hij zich op; hij schudt de val heen en weer
om te ontvluchten. Maar ontsnappen zal hij niet. En hij schoot zijne
bus af naar zijne beenen.
--Getroffen, sprak hij, want gekwetst valt hij neder!
En hij floot als de zeemeeuw.
Plotseling begon de klok van de kerk wacharm te luiden, en riep de
schelle stem van een knaapje in 't dorp:
--Wordt wakker, gij allen, die slaapt; de weerwolf is gevangen!
--Hoezee! God zij gedankt! sprak Uilenspiegel.
Tonia, de moeder van Betkin, Lansaem, heur man, Judocus en Michiel,
heure broeders, kwamen het eerst met hunne lanteernen.
--Hebt gij hem vast? vroegen zij.
--Ziet maar, daar ligt hij op den weg, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--God zij gedankt! spraken zij.
En zij maakten het teeken des kruises.
--Wie is daar aan 't luiden? vroeg Uilenspiegel.
Lansaem antwoordde:
--Mijn oudste zoon; de jongste loopt het dorp rond, om de menschen
op te kloppen en te roepen, dat de wolf gevangen is. Heil U!
--De assche klopt op mijn hert, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
Plotseling begon de weerwolf te spreken en zeide hij:
--Heb medelijden met mij, Uilenspiegel, heb medelijden.
--De wolf spreekt, zeiden allen een kruis slaande. Hij is de duivel,
want reeds kent hij Uilenspiegel's naam.
--Heb medelijden, medelijden, smeekte de stem, zeg aan die klok van
te zwijgen; zij klept als de doodklok; medelijden, ik ben de wolf
niet. Mijne polsen zijn doorgesneden in de val; ik ben oud en ik
bloed, medelijden! Welk schelle kinderstem hoor ik daar het dorp
wakker maken? Medelijden!
--Ik herken uwe stem, ik heb ze vroeger gehoord, sprak Uilenspiegel
onstuimig. Gij zijt de vischverkooper, de moordenaar van Klaas, de
bloedzuiger der arme meidekens. Mannen en vrouwlieden, weest zonder
vrees; 't is de deken, die Soetkin deed sterven van smerte.
En met eene hand hield hij hem bij den nek, onder de kin, terwijl
hij met de andere zijn kruismes trok.
Maar Tonia, de moeder van Betkin, hield hem tegen en riep:
--Neem hem levend gevangen.
En met klissen trok zij zijn grijze haren uit, terwijl zij zijn
aangezicht met heure nagelen doorwoelde.
En zij huilde van droefheid en woede.
Met de handen gevat in de val, en kronkelend ter oorzake van de hevige
smert, riep de weerwolf:
--Hebt medelijden, hebt toch medelijden; o, die vrouw, doet ze
weggaan. Ik zal twee gouden karolussen geven. Breekt die klokken! Waar
zijn die tierende kinderen?
--Houdt hem levend! schreeuwde Tonia, houdt hem levend, hij moet het
betalen. De doodklokken kleppen voor u, moordenaar. Met zacht vuur,
met gloeiende tangen! Houdt hem levend! dat hij betale!
Intusschen stiet Tonia tegen een voorwerp, dat op den grond lag;
zij bukte zich en raapte een wafelijzer op. Toen zij het bekeek
bij den gloed van de toortsen, zag zij, naar de Brabantsche wijs,
diepe ruitjes in de ijzeren platen, maar daarenboven was het bezet met
lange en scherpe tanden, als een ijzeren muil. En als zij het toedeed,
was het als de muil van een wolfshond.
Tonia hield toen het wafelijzer vast, opende het en sloot het
beurtelings, en deed daarbij het ijzerwerk knarsen. En ze scheen
waanzinnig en, razend en knarsetandend, reutelend als eene zieltogende,
zuchtend van de bittere smert, die dorstte naar weerwraak, beet zij
met het ijzer den gevangene in zijne armen, in zijne beenen, in zijn
lijf, overal, doch vooral in den nek; en telkens dat zij het ijzer
toedrukte, sprak zij:
--Zoo deed hij met Betkin, met de ijzeren tanden. Hij betale. Bloedt
gij, moordenaar? God is rechtveerdig. Hoor maar de doodklok. Betkin
roept om gewroken te worden. Voelt gij de tanden? 't Zijn de tanden
van God!
En zij beet zonder ophouden of medelijden, en sloeg met het wafelijzer,
als zij er hem niet mee kon bijten. Maar gedreven door heur groote
begeerte naar wraak, doodde zij hem niet.
--Genade, schreeuwde de vischverkooper, Uilenspiegel, steek mij dood
met uw kruismes, stel aan mijn lijden een einde. Smijt die vrouw
weg. Breek de klokken. Dood de kinderen, die schreeuwen!
En Tonia folterde hem zonder ophouden, totdat een oud man medelijden
kreeg en heur het wafelijzer ontnam.
Maar toen spugde Tonia den weerwolf in het gezicht en trok ze zijne
haren uit, zeggende:
--Gij zult betalen, met zacht vuur, met gloeiende tangen: uwe oogen
zal ik met mijne nagelen uitrukken!
Intusschen waren al de visschers, boeren en vrouwlieden van Heist
bijgekomen, als zij vernomen hadden, dat de weerwolf geen duivel,
maar een man was.
Eenigen droegen lanteernen en toortsen. En allen riepen:
--Dief en moordenaar, waar hebt gij het goud weggestoken, dat gij
den armen slachtofferen ontroofdet? Hij moet alles teruggeven!
--Ik heb geen goud; hebt medelijden! smeekte de vischverkooper.
En de vrouwlieden smeten zand en steenen naar hem.
--Hij betale! hij betale! schreeuwde Tonia.
--Medelijden, zuchtte hij, ik ben druipend van het bloed, dat gutst
uit mijn wonden.
--Uw bloed, sprak Tonia. O, gij moet er houden voor de hand van den
beul. Hij moet sterven met zacht vuur, zijne hand afgekapt worden,
met gloeiende tangen genepen! Hij zal betalen, hij zal betalen.
En zij wilde hem slaan; doch zij viel buiten kennis op het zand als
eene doode; en men liet heur daar liggen totdat zij terug tot zich
zelve kwam.
Intusschen had Uilenspiegel de handen van den gevangene uit de val
verlost, en toen zag hij, dat drie vingeren ontbraken aan zijne
rechterhand.
En hij beval hem stevig te knevelen en in eene vischmand te
binden. Mannen, vrouwlieden en kinderen togen toen henen naar Damme,
en droegen onderwege beurtelings de benne met haar verachtelijke
vracht. En anderen droegen lanteernen en toortsen.
En de vischverkooper zei gedurig:
--Breekt de klokken, doodt de kinderen, die schreeuwen.
En Tonia sprak:
--Hij betale, met zacht vuurken, met gloeiende tangen, hij betale!
En dan weer zwegen beiden. En Uilenspiegel hoorde niets meer dan den
jagenden adem van Tonia, den zwaren stap van de mannen op het krakende
zand en de zee, die rolde als de donder.
En, met treurig hert, zag hij naar de wolken, die, als waanzinnigen,
elkander achternazetten in den hemel; naar de zee, waar de branding
zich als lichtende schaapkens vertoonde, en, bij den gloed van
lanteernen en toortsen, naar het doodsbleeke gelaat van den
vischverkooper, dewelke hem bezag met valschheid en wraaklust.
En de assche klopte op zijn hert.
En in vier uren gingen zij naar Damme, alwaar het gemeen reeds te
hoop geloopen was, daar het de tijding reeds kende. Allen wilden
den vischverkooper zien en volgden de visschers al dansend, zingend
en roepend:
--De weerwolf is gevangen; hij is gepakt, de moordenaar! Gezegend
zij Uilenspiegel! Lang leve onze broeder Uilenspiegel!
En er was veel beweging onder het gemeeen.
Toen zij aan 't huis van den baljuw waren, kwam deze vóór op het
gerucht en zei tot Uilenspiegel:
--Gij zijt overwinnaar! Heil u!
--De assche van Klaas klopte op mijn hert, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
Toen sprak de baljuw:
--Gij krijgt de helft van de nalatenschap des moordenaars.
--Geef dat aan de slachtofferen, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
Lamme en Nele kwamen nader; lachend en weenend van geluk, kuste Nele
heuren vriend Uilenspiegel; Lamme sprong log als een beer omhoog en
klopte op den buik van zijn vriend, zeggende:
--Dat is een brave, koene en trouwe gezel; 't is mijn vriend,
mijn spitsbroeder: zulke vrienden hebt gij niet, gijlieden van
't platteland.
Maar de visschers lachten en spotten met hem.
XLIV.
De burgstorm luidde 's anderen daags, om den baljuw, de schepenen
en de griffiers ter vierschaar te roepen op de banken van graszoden,
rond den boom der justitie, dewelke een schoone lindeboom was.
En rondom stond het gemeen.
De vischverkooper, ondervraagd, wilde niets belijden, zelfs niet
wanneer men hem de drie vingeren toonde, die de soldaat afgekapt had,
en die aan zijne rechterhand ontbraken. Hij antwoordde steeds:
--Ik ben arm en oud, hebt medelijden met mij!
Maar het gemeen jouwde hem uit en riep:
--Gij zijt een oude wolf, een moordenaar van onschuldige kinderen. Geen
medelijden, heeren rechters!
De vrouwlieden spraken:
--Ge moet ons niet bezien met uwe ijskoude oogen; gij zijt een man en
geen duivel: wij vreezen u niet. Wreedaardig beest, lafhertiger dan
eene kat die de vogeltjes in hun nestje opvreet, dooddet gij de arme
meidekens, die niets vroegen dan in braafheid hun liefelijk leven
te slijten.
--Hij betale, hij betale met zacht vuur, met gloeiende tangen,
riep Tonia.
En, hoewel de serjanten van de gemeente het heur verboden, hitsten
de moeders heure knapen en meidekens op, om steenen te werpen naar
den vischverkooper. En dezen deden het: en telkens dat hij hen bezag,
jouwden zij hem uit, en gedurig riepen zij:
--Bloedzuiger! bloedzuiger! slaat dood!
En gedurig riep Tonia:
--Hij betale met zacht vuur, met gloeiende tangen, hij betale!
En het volk morde.
--Ziet eens, zeiden de vrouwen tot elkander, hij heeft koude onder
de heldere zon, die gloort aan den hemel, en kan zijn witte haren of
zijn vaneengereten gezicht niet verwarmen.
--Hij siddert van smerte!
--'t Is de rechtveerdigheid Gods!
--Ziet eens hoe jammerlijk hij zich recht houdt!
--En zijne moordenaarshanden, van voren gebonden, bloeden ten gevolge
van het prangen der val.
--Hij betale, hij betale! schreeuwde Tonia.
En jammerend zuchtte hij:
--Ik ben arm, laat mij gaan.
En iedereen, tot zelfs de rechters, dreef den spot met hem. Toen
veinsde hij te weenen om het volk te vermurwen. Maar de vrouwen
lachten.
Gezien de genoegzame gronden tot torture, werd hij veroordeeld om op
de pijnbank te worden gezet, totdat hij zou bekennen hoe hij doodde,
van waar hij kwam, waar de kleederen van zijn slachtofferen waren,
en de plaats, waar hij zijn geld verborg.
Toen hij, met de te smalle nieuwlederen schoenen aan de voeten,
in de folterkamer gebracht werd, vroeg de baljuw hem, hoe Satan hem
beroerd had zulke afgrijselijke misdaden te bedrijven; hij antwoordde:
--Ik zelf ben Satan, want ik gelijk hem in alles. Reeds toen ik zeer
klein was,--ik was leelijk en schraal en onbehendig in alle spelen
en lichaamsoefeningen,--aanzag een iegelijk mij voor eenen onnoozele,
en werd ik dikwijls geslagen. Knapen, noch meidekens hadden medelijden
met mij. Jongeling geworden, wilde geenerlei meideken weten van mij,
zelfs niet mits betaling. Toen vatte ik wrok en haat op tegen een
iegelijk wezen, dat komt van de vrouw. Daarom kloeg ik Klaas aan, dien
een ieder beminde. En ik beminde alleenlijk Munt, die mijn witte of
goudgele gezelline was; met Klaas te doen sterven, vond ik profijt en
plezier. Nadien moest ik, meer nog dan vroeger, leven als een wolf,
en ik droomde van te bijten. Op reize door Brabant, zag ik er de
wafelijzers van dat land en zei ik bij mij zelven, dat een dergelijk
ijzer mij zou kunnen dienen als een ijzeren muil. Ha! had ik u bij
den kraag, gij allen, boosaardige tijgers, die genoegen schept in de
folteringen eens grijsaards! Ik zou u bijten met nog meerder genoegen
dan den soldaat en het meideken. Want, als ik heur op het zand, in
de zonne zoo liefelijk zag slapen met het zakje geld in de handen,
maakten liefde en medelijden zich meester van mij; doch daar ik te
oud ben en het kind niet kon nemen, beet ik het met de ijzeren tanden.
De baljuw vroeg hem waar hij woonde; de vischverkooper antwoordde:
--Te Ramskapelle; van daar ga ik naar Blankenberge, naar Heist,
ja zelfs naar Knokke. Op Zon- en kermisdagen bak ik, met dat ijzer,
wafelen naar de wijs van die van Brabant. Het was altijd zuiver en goed
gesmeerd. En in al de dorpen werd die nieuwigheid uit vreemde gewesten
zeer goed onthaald. En als het u belieft nog meerder te weten, en hoe
het komt, dat niemand mij kon herkennen, zal ik u zeggen, dat ik mijn
aangezicht wit en mijne haren ros verfde. Wat de wolfshuid betreft,
dewelke gij mij toont met uw wreeden, ondervragenden vinger, die komt
van twee wolven, die ik gedood heb in de bosschen van Raveschoot en
Maldegem. Ik had de vellen maar aaneen te naaien om er mij mede te
bedekken. Ik verborg ze in eene kist in het duin van Heist; daar ook
zijn de kleederen, gestolen door mij, om ze later te verkoopen bij
een goede gelegenheid.
--Trek hem van voor het vuur weg, sprak de baljuw.
De beul gehoorzaamde.
--Waar is uw goud? vroeg nog de baljuw.
--De koning zal het niet weten, antwoordde de vischverkooper.
--Brand hem van dichtbij met de vlammende keersen, sprak de
baljuw. Breng hem dichter bij het vuur.
De hangman gehoorzaamde en de vischverkooper schreeuwde:
--Ik zal niets belijden. Ik sprak reeds te veel: gij zult mij
verbranden. Ik ben geen tooveraar: waarom plaatst gij mij bij het
vuur? Mijn voeten bloeden ten gevolge van de brandwonden. Ik zal niets
zeggen. Waarom nu nog dichter? Zij bloeden, zeg ik u, zij bloeden;
die schoenen zijn van gloeiend ijzer gemaakt! Mijn goud? welnu, mijn
eenige vriend op deze wereld is ... trek mij weg van het vuur; het
is in mijnen kelder te Ramskapelle, in eene doos ... laat mij gaan;
genade, ontferming, heeren rechters; vermaledijde hangman, neem de
keersen weg.... Hij brandt mij nog meerder ... het ligt in eene doos
met dubbelen bodem en is gewikkeld in een wollen deken, opdat het
niet rammelen zou, als men de doos schudt; nu heb ik alles gezegd,
breng mij weg van het vuur!
Als hij van vóór het vuur werd geschoven, lachte hij valschelijk.
De baljuw vroeg hem waarom hij lachte.
--Van genoegen, omdat ik verlost ben, antwoordde hij.
De baljuw zeide tot hem:
--Vroeg niemand u ooit om uw wafelijzer met wreede tanden te zien?
De vischverkooper antwoordde:
--Men zag, dat het een wafelijzer was, teenemaal gelijk aan de anderen,
behalve dat er gaten in waren, in dewelke ik's nachts de ijzeren tanden
vastschroefde; met den dageraad nam ik ze er uit; de boeren verkozen
mijne wafelen boven die van de andere kooplieden en hieten ze "wafelen
met Brabantsche knoopen", ter oorzake van de ledige holten,--waarin
de tanden geschroefd werden,--en dewelke kleine halfronden, die op
knoopen geleken, op de wafelen maakten.
Maar de baljuw vervolgde.
--Wanneer beet gij de arme slachtofferen?
's Nachts, en ook 's daags. 's Daags dwaalde ik langs het duin
en de groote wegen, met mijn wafelijzer steeds op den loer, maar
voornamelijk 's Zaterdags, de groote merktdag te Brugge. Zag ik een
boer voorbijkomen met een droevig gezicht, dan liet ik hem gaan,
want ik dacht, dat zijne droefgeestigheid te wijten was aan den staat
zijner beurze; doch ik bleef aanstappen naast dengene, die wel te moede
scheen; en als hij er zich het minst aan verwachtte, beet ik hem in
den nek, na hetwelk ik zijne beugeltasch nam. En niet alleenlijk in
het duin liep ik, maar langs alle wegen en paden van 't platteland.
Toen sprak de baljuw:
--Heb berouw en bid God.
Maar godslasterlijk antwoordde de vischverkooper:
--'t Is de Heer God, die wilde dat ik was wat ik ben: ik deed alles
ondanks mij zelven, beroerd door den wil der Natuur. Boosaardige
tijgeren, die mij onrechtveerdig wilt straffen! Maar veroordeelt mij
niet tot het vuur: ik deed alles ondanks mij zelven; hebt medelijden,
ik ben arm en oud; ik zal sterven van mijne wonden; verbrandt mij
toch niet!
Toen werd hij terug naar de vierschaar gebracht, onder den lindeboom,
om er het vonnis te hooren, in bijzijn van het vergaderde volk.
En als schromelijke moordenaar, dief en godslasteraar, werd hij
veroordeeld om de tong met een gloeienden priem doorstoken te worden,
de rechterhand afgekapt, en met een zacht vuur verbrand, totdat de
dood er op volge, vóór de pui van het Schepenhuis.
En Tonia riep:
--'t Is rechtveerdig, hij betale!
En het volk riep:
--Lang leven de Heeren van de Wet!
En hij werd terug naar het Steen gebracht, alwaar men hem vleesch en
wijn brengen kwam. En hij was blijde, zeggende, dat hij er tot dan
toe nooit had gegeten en gedronken, maar dat de koning, die zijne
goederen erfde, wel dien laatsten maaltijd mocht betalen.
En hij grijnslachte.
's Anderen daags, bij zonsopgang, toen men hem naar het schavot bracht,
zag hij Uilenspiegel omtrent den brandstapel staan; en hij riep,
met den vinger naar hem wijzend:
--Die dààr, die moordenaar van grijsaards, moet insgelijks sterven;
tien jaar geleden smeet hij mij te Damme in de vaart, omdat ik zijn
vader had aangeklaagd. Daardoor diende ik, als trouw onderdaan,
Zijne Katholieke Majesteit.
De klokken van Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk klepten.
--Voor u ook kleppen die klokken, sprak hij tot Uilenspiegel; gij
zult gehangen worden, daar gij gemoord hebt!
--De vischverkooper liegt, riepen die van 't gemeen; hij liegt,
de beul, de moordenaar!
En, als waanzinnig, smeet Tonia eenen steen naar hem, die hem kwetste
aan 't voorhoofd. En ze riep:
--Had hij u verdronken, ge zoudt niet geleefd hebben om mijn arm
dochterken te bijten lijk een bloedzuiger, die ge zijt!
Uilenspiegel uitte geen woord; Lamme sprak:
--Heeft iemand den vischverkooper in 't water zien smijten?
Uilenspiegel antwoordde niet.
--Neen, neen, riep het gemeen, hij heeft gelogen, de beul!
--Neen, ik heb geenszins gelogen, schreeuwde de vischverkooper, hij
wierp mij er in, terwijl ik hem om vergiffenis smeekte, en ik kon
er maar uitgeraken door middel van een schuitje, dat aan den oever
vastgemeerd lag. Doornat en bibberend, kwam ik met veel moeite naar
mijne armzalige hut, alwaar ik de koorts had, alwaar niemand mij
oppaste, terwijl ik tusschen leven en dood lag.
--Gij liegt, sprak Lamme, niemand heeft het gezien.
--Neen, niemand, riep Tonia. In 't vuur, met den beul! Alvorens te
sterven, wil hij nog een onschuldig slachtoffer maken; in 't vuur,
hij betale! Hij heeft gelogen! Belijd niet, Uilenspiegel, al mocht
het nog waar zijn. Er zijn geene getuigen. Hij betale met zacht vuur,
met gloeiende tangen!
--Bedreeft gij den moord? vroeg de baljuw tot Uilenspiegel.
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Den aanklager, den moordenaar van Klaas, mijn vader, smeet ik in
't water. De assche klopte op mijn hert.
--Hij bekent, sprak de vischverkooper; hij zal insgelijks sterven? Waar
is de galg, dat ik ze zie? Waar is de beul met het zweerd der
justitie? De doodklok klept ook voor u, nietdeug, moordenaar van een
armen grijsaard.
Uilenspiegel sprak:
--Ik smeet u in 't water om u te dooden: de assche van mijn vader
klopt op mijn hert.
En in het volk spraken de vrouwen:
--Waarom het stuk bekend, Uilenspiegel? Niemand heeft het gezien;
nu zult gij sterven.
En de vischverkooper lachte, danste van bittere vreugde, zwaaide met
zijne armen, dewelke met bloedige doeken omwonden waren.
--Hij zal sterven, sprak hij, hij zal ter helle varen met een strop
om den hals, als dieper, rabauw en truwant: hij zal sterven; God
is rechtveerdig!
--Neen, hij zal niet sterven, sprak de baljuw. Na tien jaren wordt, in
Vlaanderenland, de moord niet meer gepunieerd. Uilenspiegel pleegde een
lakensweerdige daad, maar 't was uit kinderlijke liefde. Uilenspiegel
zal uit dien hoofde niet worden vervolgd.
--Leve de Wet! riep het volk. Lang leven de Heeren van de Wet!
De klokken van Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk klepten. En de vischverkooper
knarsetandde, boog het hoofd en weende zijn eersten traan.
En men kapte zijne hand af, en men doorstak zijne tong met een
gloeienden priem, en hij werd levend verbrand met zacht vuur, vóór
de pui van het Schepenhuis.
Als hij den dood nabij was, riep hij:
--De koning zal mijn goud niet hebben; ik heb gelogen ... Boosaardige
tijgeren, ik zal weerkomen om u te bijten.
En Tonia riep:
--Hij betale, hij betale! Zie hoe zijne armen en beenen, die naar den
moord liepen, wringen en smijten: het lichaam van den moordenaar rookt;
zijn wit haar, hyena's haar, brandt op zijn bleek gezicht. Hij betale,
hij betale!
En de vischverkooper huilde als een wolf.
En de klokken van Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk klepten.
En Lamme en Uilenspiegel stegen terug op hunne ezelen.
En de jammerende Nele bleef bij Katelijne, dewelke gedurig zeide:
--Doe het vuur weg! het hoofd brandt; kom terug, Hansken, mijn liefste.
VIERDE BOEK.
I.
Te Heist, op het duin zijnde, zagen Uilenspiegel en Lamme van Oostende,
Blankenberge, Knokke, menigvuldige visschersschuiten aankomen,
vol gewapende mannen, die, in navolging van de Zeeuwsche Geuzen,
een zilveren halve maan op hun hoed droegen met deze woorden: Liever
den Turc als den Paus.
Uilenspiegel was wel te moede; hij floot als de leeuwerik; allerwegen
antwoordde het strijdzuchtig gekraai van den haan.
De booten vaarden of vischten, verkochten hare vangst en landden de
eene na de andere te Emden. Daar huisde Willem van Blois, heer van
Treslong, die, op last van den prins van Oranje, een schip uitrustte.
Uilenspiegel en Lamme kwamen te Emden, terwijl op bevel van Treslong,
de booten der Geuzen weder in zee staken.
Treslong, die sedert elf weken te Emden was, verveelde zich diep. Hij
stapte van de boot op den wal en van den wal op de boot, als een
geketende beer.
Uilenspiegel en Lamme wandelden langs de kaaien en ontwaarden daar een
heer met een goede tronie, die er eenigszins droefgeestig uitzag en
druk bezig was met de steenen van de kaai uit te steken, door middel
van een breekijzer. Het ging niet gemakkelijk, doch met goeden moed
zette hij zich steeds opnieuw aan het werk, terwijl achter zijnen
rug een hond aan een been knaagde.
Uilenspiegel kwam naar den hond toe en gebaarde, dat hij hem zijn
been wilde afnemen. De hond bromde; Uilenspiegel scheidde niet uit:
de hond werd kwader en blafte en bromde uit al zijne macht.
De heer keerde zich om op dat gerucht, en zeide tot Uilenspiegel:
--Waarom moet gij dien hond plagen?
--Waarom, messire, moet gij de kasseien plagen?
--Dat is hetzelfde niet, sprak de heer,
--Het verschil is zoo groot niet, antwoordde Uilenspiegel: als de
hond aan zijn been houdt en het niet loslaten wil, houden de kasseien
ook aan de kaai en willen zij er aan blijven. En menschen van mijnen
stand mogen wel eenen hond plagen, als lieden van den uwen de straat
niet met rust laten.
Lamme stond achter Uilenspiegel en dorst geen woord uiten.
--Wie zijt gij? vroeg de heer.
--Ik ben Thijl Uilenspiegel, zoon van Klaas, die verbrand werd om
het geloof.
En hij floot als de leeuwerik en de heer kraaide als de haan.
--Ik ben admiraal Treslong, sprak hij; wat wilt gij van mij?
Uilenspiegel vertelde hem zijne lotgevallen en langde hem vijfhonderd
karolussen.
--Wie is die dikzak? vroeg Treslong, naar Lamme wijzend.
--Mijn gezel en mijn vriend, antwoordde Uilenspiegel: hij wil evenals
ik, op uw schip, de schoone stem van de donderbus begeleiden, en het
lied der verlossing van den grond onzer vaderen zingen.
--Gij zijt twee dappere kerels, zeide Treslong, gij moogt op mijne
boot inschepen.
Toen was men in de Sprokkelmaand: scherp was de wind en vinnig de
vorst. Na drie weken spijtig wachten, barstte Treslong's ongeduld uit
en verliet hij Emden. Daar hij Texel dacht binnen te varen, vertrok
hij van 't Vlie, maar hij was gedwongen Wieringen binnen te loopen,
alwaar zijn vaartuig omringd werd door 't ijs.
Weldra zag men een vroolijk schouwspel rondom het schip:
schaatsenrijders heel in de panne, schaatsende vrouwkens met wambuizen
en rokken met gouden, zilveren, scharlaken, hemelsblauwe borduursels;
gierende meidekens; en allen gingen, kwamen, joelden, gleden achter
elkander, of bij paren, terwijl zij op 't ijs een minnelied zongen:
ofwel trokken zij in kramen en tenten met wimpels versierd, om
brandewijn, appelsienen, vijgen, peperkoek, eieren, warme worsten,
heetekoeken en zuurtjes te drinken en te eten, terwijl rond henlieden
arre- en zeilsleden onder hare sporen het ijs deden krassen.
Lamme, steeds naar zijne vrouw zoekend, schaverdijnde in 't rond,
gelijk de lustige mannen en vrouwlieden, doch hij viel dikwijls op
zijn achterste.
Intusschen ging Uilenspiegel eten en drinken in een kleine taveerne
op de kaai, alwaar hij zijne portie niet duur moest betalen; en hij
bleef geerne praten met de oude bazinne.
Op een Zondag, rond negen uren, ging hij er binnen en vroeg hij
zijn eetmaal.
--Maar, sprak hij tot een aanvallige vrouw, die vóórkwam om hem te
dienen, wat deedt gij met uwe oude rimpelen? Uw mond heeft al zijn
witte en jeugdige tanden, en uwe lippen zijn als kersen zoo rood. Is
hij voor mij, die zoete, schalksche glimlach?
--Wel neen, zeide zij, maar wat wilt gij?
--U, sprak hij.
De vrouw antwoordde:
--Dat is te veel voor een spiering lijk gij; wilt gij ander vleesch?
Daar Uilenspiegel niet sprak, ging zij voort:
--Wat hebt gij gedaan, zeide zij, met dien schoonen, welgevormden,
dikken man, denwelken ik dikwijls bij u zie?
--Lamme? vroeg hij.
--Wat hebt gij er mee gedaan? vroeg zij.
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Hij eet in de kramen, harde eieren, gerookte paling, gezouten visch,
zuurtjes en alles wat hij tusschen de tanden kan steken; dit alles
om zijne vrouw op te zoeken. Waarom zijt gij de mijne niet? Wilt gij
vijftig gulden van mij? Wilt gij een gouden halssnoer?
Maar zij maakte het teeken des kruises.
--Ik ben te verkoopen noch te nemen, zeide zij.
--Bemint gij niemand? vroeg hij.
--Ik bemin u als mijn evennaaste; maar vóór alles bemin ik Onzen
Lieven Heer en Zijne Moeder de Heilige Maria, die mij bevelen in
kuischheid mijn leven te slijten. Hard en zwaar zijn mijne plichten,
doch de Heer is ons, armen vrouwen, behulpzaam. Nochtans zijn er die
bezwijken. Is uw dikke vriend vroolijk van aard?
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Als hij eet is hij blijde, anders is hij treurig gestemd, en altijd
zit hij in gedachten verzonken. Maar gij, zijt gij droefgeestig
of vroolijk?
--Wij, vrouwen, sprak zij, zijn slavinnen.
--Ik ga tot Lamme zeggen, dat hij u moet komen bezoeken.
--Doe dat niet, sprak zij; hij zou weenen en ik insgelijks.
--Zaagt gij ooit zijne vrouw? vroeg Uilenspiegel.
Zuchtend antwoordde zij:
Zij zondigde met hem en werd veroordeeld tot een wreede penitentie. Zij
weet, dat hij op zee gaat voor de zegepraal der ketterije; 't is droef
voor een kerstenhert dit te moeten denken. Verdedig hem, als men hem
aanvalt; verpleeg hem, als hij gewond is: zijne vrouw verzocht mij
u die bede te doen.
--Lamme is mijn vriend en mijn broeder, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--Ha! zuchtte zij, waarom keert gij beiden niet terug in den schoot
onzer Moeder, de Heilige Kerk!
--Die heure kinderen verbrandt, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
En hij toog henen.
Daar de wind vinnig blies en het ijs maar immer dikker en sterker
maakte, kon het schip van Treslong niet vertrekken; de matrozen en
de soldaten vermaakten zich dus met sleden en schaatsen.
Uilenspiegel was in de taveerne en, jammerend en droevig, zei de
lieftallige gastvrouw tot hem:
--Arme Lamme! arme Uilenspiegel!
--Waarom beklaagt gij ons zoo zeer? vroeg Uilenspiegel.
--Laas! laas! zeide zij, waarom ook gelooft gij niet aan de
misse? Zeker gingt gij naar den hemel, en in deze wereld zou ik
vermogen u te redden.
Ziende, dat zij naar de deur ging en aandachtiglijk luisterde,
vroeg Uilenspiegel:
--Is 't de sneeuw niet, die gij hoort vallen?
--Neen, sprak zij.
--Luistert gij naar den wind, die huilt in het want?
--Neen, sprak zij nogmaals.
--Of naar het blijde gejuich van onze dappere matrozen in de naburige
herberg?
--De dood sluipt stil als een dief, zeide zij.
--De dood, zeide Uilenspiegel, ik begrijp u niet; kom binnen en spreek.
--Daar zijn ze, sprak zij.
--Wie?
--Wie? antwoordde zij. De soldaten van Simon Bol, die, in naam van
den hertog, u allen gaan vangen; zoo men u hier zoo goed behandelt,
is het om met u te doen als met de ossen, die men mest in de weide. Ha,
waarom, zeide zij, badend in tranen, waarom wist ik zulks niet vroeger?
--Houd op met uw gejank en geschreeuw, sprak Uilenspiegel, en blijf
hier!
--Verraad mij niet, sprak zij.
Uilenspiegel ging het huis uit, liep naar al de kramen en taveernen,
en fluisterde in het oor van de matrozen en de soldaten:
--De Spanjool komt!
Allen liepen naar het schip, bereidden in aller ijl al wat behoefde
voor het gevecht, en wachtten dan den vijand af.
Uilenspiegel zeide tot Lamme:
--Ziet gij die lieftallige vrouw daar, op de kaai, met heur zwarten
rok met scharlaken borduurselen, die heur gezicht met heur witte
huik verbergt?
--'t Is mij eender, antwoordde Lamme. Ik heb koude en zou willen
slapen.
En hij wikkelde zijn hoofd in zijn opperste kleed. En alzoo hoorde
hij niet meer dan een doove.
Toen herkende Uilenspiegel de lieftallige vrouw en, van op het schip,
riep hij heur toe:
--Wilt gij ons volgen?
--Tot in het graf, zeide zij, maar ik mag niet....
--Gij zoudt goed doen, sprak Uilenspiegel; bedenk toch: als de
nachtegaal in het bosch blijft, is hij gelukkig en zingt hij: maar
als hij het verlaat en zijne broze vleugelen waagt in den wind van
de wijde zee, breekt hij ze en sterft hij.
--Thuis heb ik gezongen, sprak zij, en buiten zou ik zingen, zoo ik
maar mocht.
Vervolgens het schip naderend, sprak zij:
--Neem, Uilenspiegel, neem dezen balsem voor u en uwen vriend, die
slaapt als hij diende te waken.
En henen gaande, riep zij:
--Lamme! Lamme! God hoede u voor het kwaad!
En zij liet heur gezicht zien.
--Mijne vrouw! mijne vrouw! riep Lamme.
En hij wilde op het ijs springen.
--Uw trouwe vrouw! zeide zij.
En zij liep heen.
Lamme wilde van het dek op het ijs springen, maar een soldaat hield
hem bij zijn opperste kleed en belette het hem. Hij weende, schreide,
smeekte, dat men hem zou laten vertrekken. Maar de provoost zeide hem:
--Als gij het schip verlaat, wordt gij gehangen.
Lamme wilde toch op het ijs springen, maar een oude Geus weerhield
hem en sprak:
--De vloer is nat, gij zoudt koude voeten krijgen.
En Lamme viel op zijn achterste, schreide en herhaalde gedurig:
--Mijne vrouw! mijne vrouw! laat mij bij mijne vrouw gaan!
--Gij zult ze wel weerzien, sprak Uilenspiegel. Zij bemint u, maar
ziet God liever dan u.
--'t Is een razende duivelin, riep Lamme. Als ze God liever ziet dan
heuren man, waarom komt ze dan liefelijk en streelend onder mijne
oogen? En als zij mij bemint, waarom verlaat ze mij steeds?
--Ziet men klaar in de donkere putten? vroeg Uilenspiegel!
--Laas! zuchtte Lamme, ik zal het besterven!
En bleek en droefgeestig bleef hij zitten op het dek.
Intusschen rukten de lieden van Simon Bol aan, met een machtig geschut.
Zij schoten naar het schip, dat hun antwoordde. En de kogels braken
het ijs in het ronde. En tegen den avond viel een warme regen.
De wind woei uit het Westen; de zee werd omstuimig onder het ijs en
hief het omhoog met ontzaglijke blokken, dewelke men zag opstaan en
neervallen met een eentonig gekrakkrak, niet zonder gevaar voor het
schip, dat, als de morgenstond de zwarte wolken verbrak, zijn linnen
vleugelen opensperde, als een vogel der vrijheid, en naar de vrije
zee stevende.
Daar zeilden zij naar de vloot van messire Willem Lumey, graaf van de
Mark, admiraal van Holland en Zeeland, die als dusdanig eene lanteerne
omhoog in de mast van zijn schip voerde.
--Bezie hem goed, Lamme, sprak Uilenspiegel; hij zal u niet sparen,
als gij met geweld het schip wilt verlaten. Hoort gij zijne stem
bulderen als de donder? Zie hoe groot en breed hij is, zie zijn hooge
gestalte! Aanschouw zijn groote handen met kromme nagelen. Zie zijn
ronde koele oogen: 't zijn arendsoogen en zijn langen, puntigen baard,
denwelken hij gezworen heeft te laten groeien totdat hij alle papen
en monniken opgeknoopt heeft, om de beide graven te wreken! Zie eens,
hoe wreed en geducht hij is; gewis doet hij u hangen, zoo gij voortgaat
met zuchten en klagen: Mijne vrouw! Mijne vrouw!
--Mijn vriend, antwoordde Lamme, wie van koorden spreekt voor zijn
evennaaste, draagt een hennepen kraag om den hals.
--Gij zult hem dragen vóór mij. Dat is mijn hertelijke wensch,
sprak Uilenspiegel.
--Aan de galg zal uwe vuile tong eene el lang uit uwen bek steken,
antwoordde Lamme.
En de beide vrienden proestten van 't lachen.
Dien dag kaapte het vaartuig van Treslong eene kog van Biscaye, die
geladen was met kwikzilver, stofgoud, wijn en specerijen. En het schip
werd geledigd tot het merg, bemanning en buit, als een osseschinkel
onder den tand van den leeuw.
Het was ook te dien tijde, dat de hertog den Nederlanden wreede,
afschuwelijke belastingen oplegde, en al de inwoneren, die erf of
have verkochten, tot betaling dwong van duizend op de tienduizend
gulden. En die last was bestendig. Alle hoegenaamde koopers en
verkoopers moesten aan den koning den tienden penning van de koopsom
betalen, wat het volk zeggen deed, dat de handelswaar, die binst
dezelfde week tienmaal verkocht werd, ganschelijk aan den koning kwam.
En alzoo gingen nering en hanteering naar Dood en naar Ondergang.
En de Geuzen namen den Briel, een versterkte plaats aan de zee,
die de Bakermat der Vrijheid genoemd werd.
II.
Men was in het begin van de Bloeimaand; de hemel was helder en het
vaartuig dobberde statig op de wateren. Uilenspiegel zong:
    De asch klopt op mijn hart.
    De beulen kwamen, sloegen
    Met dolk en vuur, geweld en zwaard.
    Vuil geld betaalt den vuigen spioen.
    In stêe van deugden, liefde en geloof,
    Heerschen verklikking en wantrouwen.
    De slachters dienen geslacht.
    Slaat op de krijgstrom.
    Leve de Geus! Slaat op de trom.
    De Briel is aan ons.
    Vlissingen ook, de sleutel der Schelde.
    De Heer is goed. Campveere is aan ons,
    Met Zeelands schutterij.
    We hebben kruit en lood en kogels,
    IJzeren kogels, gegoten kogels.
    De Heer is met ons, wie tegen?
    Slaat op den trommel. Zege en roem!
    Leve de Geus! Slaat op de trom.
    Het zwaard is getogen, harten hoog,
    Vuisten vast; het zwaard is getogen.
    Weg met den Tienden Penning, den nood, den dood!
    Ter galge de beul, ter galge de roover!
    Meineedig vorst wil het volk in oproer.
    Het zwaard is getogen voor ons rechten,
    Voor huis en have, voor vrouw en kinderen.
    Het zwaard is getogen. Slaat op de trom.
    Harten hoog, vuisten vast.
    Weg met den Tienden Penning, weg met snood pardoen.
    Slaat op de krijgstrom. Slaat op de trom.
... Ja, spitsbroeders en vrienden, ja, te Antwerpen, noesch over het
Schepenhuis, hebben zij een groot schavot opgericht, dat met rood
laken bekleed is; de hertog troont er op als een koning te midden van
staffieren en soldeniers. Hij wil goedgunstig glimlachen, doch trekt
slechts een afgrijselijk gezicht. Slaat op de trommel! Leve de Geus!
... Hij heeft kwijtschelding geschonken; zwijgt stille: zijn gulden
harnas flikkert in de zonne, de grootprovoost zit te peerd naast
den baldakijn; daar komt de heraut met zijn trommelaars; hij leest
algemeene kwijtschelding af voor al degenen, die niets misdeden;
de anderen zullen wreedelijk worden gestraft.
... Luistert spitsbroeders, hij leest het plakkaat, hetwelk, onder
straffe van beschuldiging van muitmakerij, de betaling van den tienden
en den twinstigsten penning beveelt.
En Uilenspiegel zong:
    Hertog, hoort ge de stem van het volk,
    't Geweldig rumoer? 't Is de zee die zwelt
    In 't zware gezwoeg der stormen.
    Geld genoeg, bloed genoeg,
    Nood genoeg. Slaat op de trom.
    't Is de klauw in de bloedende wonde,
    De diefstal na den moord. Moet ge ons goud
    Mengen met ons bloed om het te drinken?
    Wij stapten in de baan des plichts,
    Den koning getrouw. De koning is meineedig.
    Wij zijn van den eed ontslagen. Slaat op de krijgstrom.
    Hertog van Alva, bloedhertog,
    Zie kramen, en winkels gesloten,
    Zie brouwers, bakkers, kruideniers,
    Weigrend te venten om niet te betalen.
    Wie groet u langs den weg?
    Niemand. Voelt ge als een mist van pest
    Haat en smaad u omringen?
    De schoone grond van Vlaanderen,
    Het lustig land Brabánt,
    Treuren als kerkhoven.
    Waar vroeger, in tijden van vrijheid,
    Vedels zongen, pijpen schalden,
    Zijn stilte en dood.
    Slaat op de krijgstrom.
    Geen vrooe gezichten meer
    Van zingende vrijers en drinkebroers,
    Maar bleeke gelaten
    Van wie gelaten
    Wachten op 't zwaard van het onrecht.
    Slaat op de krijgstrom.
    Wie hoort nog in de taveernen
    Het lustig klinken der glazen,
    Of de helle stemmen der deernen,
    Bij benden zingend op straat?
    Brabánt en Vlaanderen, vreugdelanden,
    Zijn tranenlanden.
    Slaat op de rouwtrom.
    Grond der vaadren, verdrukte geliefde,
    Plooi niet onder den voet des moorders.
    Nijvere bijen, zwiert in zwermen
    Neer op de wespen van Spanje,
    Levend begravene vrouwen en dochters,
    Roept tot Christus: wraak!
    Dwaalt bij nacht in de velden; arme zielen,
    Roept tot God. De vuist trilt om te slaan.
    Het zwaard is getogen, hertog, we rukken uw ingewand uit
    Om u in 't aangezicht te zweepen.
    Slaat op den trommel. Het zwaard is getogen.
    Slaat op den trommel. Leve de Geus!
En al de matrozen en soldaten van het vaartuig van Uilenspiegel,
en ook van de andere vaartuigen, zongen in koor:
    Slaat op den trommel, leve de Geus!
En hunne stemmen rommelden als de donder der verlossing.
III.
Men was in Louwe, de wreede maand, die het kalf in den buik van de
koe doet vervriezen. Het had gesneeuwd en daarboven gevrozen. De
knapen vingen, met vogelteer, de musschen, die op de harde sneeuw
een schamel stuksken brood kwamen zoeken, en brachten dat wild naar
de hutten hunner ouders. Op den grijzen hemel staken, onbeweeglijk,
de geraamten der boomen af, welker takken met sneeuwen kussens waren
versierd, die insgelijks de daken der hutten en de nok van de muren
bedekten, en in dewelke men pooten van katten zag, want die dieren
maakten in de sneeuw insgelijks jacht op de musschen. Heinde en ver
waren de weiden verborgen onder die wonderbare vacht, die de aarde
tegen de gure winterkoude beschut. De rook uit de schoorsteenen van
hutten en huizen stak somber af tegen den helderen hemel, en men
hoorde niet het minste gerucht.
En Katelijne en Nele zaten alleen in hare woning; en Katelijne schudde
het hoofd en sprak:
--Hans, mijn hart trekt naar u. Gij moet de zevenhonderd karolussen
teruggeven aan Uilenspiegel, den zoon van Soetkin. Zijt gij nooddruftig
en kunt gij ze thans niet teruggeven, kom dan toch maar, dat ik uw
glanzend gelaat zie. Doe het vuur weg, mijn hoofd brandt. Laas! waar
zijn uw sneeuwen kussen? waar is uw ijskoud lichaam, Hans, mijn
geliefde?
En troosteloos bleef ze vóór 't venster staan. Eensklaps kwam een
koerier, met belletjes aan den gordel, voorbijgeloopen.
--Daar komt de baljuw, de hoogbaljuw van Damme! riep de voetlooper.
En aldus liep hij tot aan het Schepenhuis, om er de burgemeesteren
en schepenen samen te roepen.
Toen hoorde Nele, in de volslagen stilte, twee klaroenen schallen. Die
van Damme kwamen allen aan hunne deur, in de meening dat het Zijne
Koninklijke Majesteit was, die zich door zulk een trompetgeschal
liet aankondigen.
En Katelijne ging ook aan de deur met Nele. In de verte zagen zij
schitterende ruiters in groepen bijeen en aan hunne spits reed een
personage, bedekt met een zwart pannen opperste kleed met marter
afgelegd, gekleed in een pannen wambuis met fijngouden belegsels
en met roode kalfsleerzen, gevoerd met martervel. En zij herkenden
den hoogbaljuw.
Achter hem reden jonge heeren, die, niettegenstaande de ordonnantie
van wijlen Zijne Keizerlijke Majestijt, aan hunne pannen kleederen,
gouden, zilveren en zijden borduursels, belegsels, banden,
boordsels droegen. En hun opperste kleederen waren, gelijk die van
den hoogbaljuw, met pels afgelegd. Zij reden vroolijk voort, met
fladderende lange struisvederen op hunne met goud afgelegde toques.
En zij zagen er allen als goede vrienden en kameraden van den
hoogbaljuw uit; en onder hen was een heer met een zure tronie,
gekleed in groene panne, met goud afgeleid; en zijn opperste kleed
was van zwarte panne, evenals zijne toque, die met lange pluimen
versierd was. En hij had een krommen neus als de bek van een gier,
een dunnen mond, ros haar, een bleek gezicht, en hij zat met fiere
houding te peerd.
Terwijl die heeren voorbij de woning reden van Katelijne, sprong
deze eensklaps naar den teugel van 't peerd van den bleeken ruiter,
en riep zij vol blijdschap:
--Hans, mijn geliefde, ik wist wel dat gij zoudt terugkomen. Zoo
zijt gij schoon, ganschelijk in de panne en in het goud, lijk eene
zon op de sneeuw! Brengt gij de zevenhonderd karolussen? Zult gij
nog schreeuwen lijk de nachtuil?
De hoogbaljuw deed den troep edellieden stilstaan en de bleeke
ruiter sprak:
--Wat wil die schooister van mij?
Maar Katelijne hield altoos het peerd bij den teugel en sprak:
--Verlaat mij niet; ik heb zoo bitter geweend om uwentwille. Zoete
nachten, mijn welbeminde, sneeuwen kussen en ijskoud lichaam.
Hier is het kind.
En zij wees naar Nele, die hem grammoedig bezag, want dreigend had
hij de karwats naar Katelijne opgeheven.
Maar Katelijne sprak schreiend:
--Ha? zoudt gij u niet meer herinneren? Neem uwe dienares in
genade. Breng mij met u waar gij wilt. Doe het vuur weg. Hans,
erbarming!
--Ga heen! sprak hij.
En hij stiet zijn peerd zoo geweldig vooruit, dat Katelijne den teugel
losliet en ten gronde viel; en het peerd trapte op heur en sloeg,
met zijn hoef, op heur voorhoofd, zoodat zij bloedde.
Toen zeide de baljuw tot den bleeken ruiter:
--Messire, kent gij die vrouwe?
--Ik ken ze niet, zeide hij, 't is zeker een krankzinnige.
Maar Nele, die Katelijne weder opgericht had, sprak luide:
--Is die vrouw krankzinnig, ik ben het niet, en wil hier sterven
van dit brokje sneeuw, dat ik eet--en zij nam een greepje sneeuw en
stak het in den mond--als die man mijne moeder niet heeft gekend,
als hij heur al heur geld niet ontnam, als hij den hond van Klaas
niet doodde, om, tegen den muur van den steenput onzer lochting,
de zevenhonderd karolussen te stelen van den armen aflijvige.
Het bloed vloeide uit de wonden van Katelijne, dewelke knielend
smeekte:
--Hans, mijn liefste, Hans, mijn welbeminde, geef mij den vredekus;
bezie mij, het bloed vloeit uit mijn voorhoofd; de ziel heeft een
gat gemaakt en nu wil zij buiten; fluks ga ik sterven: laat mij toch
niet alleen!
Vervolgens zeide zij met stillere stem:
--Eertijds hebt gij uwen vriend gedood uit jaloerschheid, langs
den dijk.
En met den vinger wees zij naar den kant van Dudzele.
--Toen bemindet gij mij meerder dan nu.
En zij nam de knie van den edelman vast en omhelsde ze, en zij greep
zijnen schoen vast en kuste dien.
--Wie is die man, die gedood werd? vroeg de hoogbaljuw.
--Ik weet het niet, genadige heer, antwoordde de bleeke ruiter. Wij
hebben geene zaken met hetgeen die schooister vertelt. Laat ons
voortgaan.
Het volk kwam te hoop rond hen; hoogpoorters en gemeen, werklieden
en boeren trokken partij voor Katelijne, en alle riepen:
--Gerechtigheid, heer baljuw, gerechtigheid!
En de baljuw sprak tot Nele:
--Wie is de man, die gedood werd? spreek volgens God en waarheid.
Nele zeide, naar den bleeken jonker wijzend:
--Deze hier kwam alle Zaterdagen in de keet om mijne moeder te zien en
heur geld af te doen: hij heeft eenen vriend van hem, Hilbert genoemd,
gedood in den akker van Servaas Vander Vichte, niet uit jaloerschheid,
maar om de zevenhonderd karolussen niet te moeten deelen met hem.
En Nele verhaalde de minnarijen van Katelijne en wat deze 's nachts
hoorde, toen zij verborgen was achter den dijk, die liep door den
kouter van Servaas Vander Vichte.
--Nele is stout, zeide Katelijne, zij is wel hard jegens Hans, jegens
heuren vader.
--Ik zweer, zeide Nele, dat hij schreeuwde als de nachtuil, om van
zijne tegenwoordigheid miede te geven.
--Gij liegt, zeide de edelman.
--Ho, neen! sprak Nele, en mijnheer de baljuw en al die heeren, hier
tegenwoordig, zien het wel: gij zijt bleek geenszins van koude, maar
van schrik. Hoe komt het dat uw gezicht niet meer blinkt? Bezigt gij
de tooverzalve niet meer, met dewelke gij u streekt, opdat gij helder
zoudt zien als de baren der zee, 's zomers, als 't donkert? Maar,
vermaledijde tooveraar, verbrand zult gij worden voor de pui van 't
Schepenhuis. Gij zijt de oorzaak van Soetkin's dood, gij bracht heuren
zoon, eenen wees, tot ellende; gij, die ongetwijfeld een edelman zijt,
kwaamt bij ons, werklieden, om mijne moeder een enkele maal een weinig
geld te brengen en er heur al de andere keeren veel te ontnemen.
--Hans, sprak Katelijne, zult gij mij nog bestrijken met de zalve,
zult gij mij nog naar den Sabbat leiden? Luister naar Nele niet:
zij is stout; gij ziet het bloed, de ziel heeft een gat gemaakt en
wil buiten; fluks zal ik sterven en dan ga ik naar 't voorgeborchte
der helle, alwaar geen vuur is.
--Zwijg, krankzinnige tooveres, zeide de edelman, ik weet niet wat
gij zeggen wilt.
--En nochtans, zeide Nele, zijt gij het, die kwaamt met eenen vriend,
dien gij mij tot man wildet geven; gij weet dat ik van hem niet wilde
weten; wat heeft hij gedaan, uw vriend Hilbert, wat heeft hij gedaan
voor zijne oogen, nadat ik er in krabde met mijne nagelen?
--Nele is stout, zeide Katelijne, geloof ze niet, Hans, mijn geliefde:
zij is grammoedig op Hilbert, die heur met geweld wilde nemen; maar nu
kan Hilbert dat nimmermeer doen, de wormen hebben hem opgegeten. En
Hilbert was leelijk; Hansken, mijn liefste, gij alleen zijt schoon;
Nele is stout!
Daarop sprak de baljuw:
--Vrouwen, gaat henen in vrede.
Maar Katelijne wilde niet weggaan van de plaats waar heur geliefde
was. En men moest ze met geweld naar heure woonstede brengen.
En al het te hoop gestroomde volk riep:
--Gerechtigheid, heer, gerechtigheid!
De serjanten van de gemeente waren bijeengekomen op het gerucht:
de baljuw gebood hun te blijven, en sprak tot de heeren en edellieden:
--Heeren en edellieden, niettegenstaande alle privileges, die
de doorluchtige orde van den adel in Vlaanderenland beschermen,
moet ik, op de beschuldigingen en hoofdzakelijk op die van hekserij,
uitgebracht tegen messire Joost Damman, denzelven apprehendeeren totdat
hij geoordeeld en gevonnist worde volgens de wetten en ordonnantiën
des Rijks. Geef mij uw zweerd af, messire Joost.
--Heer baljuw, zeide Joost Damman, met grooten hoogmoed en
adellijke fierheid, als gij mij aanhoudt, overtreedt gij de wetten
van Vlaanderen, want gij zelf zijt geen rechter. Nu, gij weet, dat
alleen valsche munters, struikroovers, brandstichters, verkrachters
van vrouwen en meidekens, soldeniers die hunnen hoofdman ontliepen,
tooveraars die de wateren vergiftigden, monniken en begijnen die hunne
kloosters ontliepen, mitsgaders gebannenen, zonder lastgeving van
den rechter, mogen geapprehendeerd worden. Nu, heeren, verdedigt mij!
Eenigen wilden bijspringen, maar de baljuw zeide tot hen:
--Heeren, ik vertegenwoordig hier onzen koning, grave en heer,
aan denwelke de beslissing van moeilijke gevallen is voorbehouden;
en ik gelast en beveel u, op peine als rebellen te worden beschouwd,
uw zweerd terug in de scheede te steken.
De edellieden gehoorzaamden; doch dewijl messire Joost Damman nog
aarzelde, riep het gemeen:
--Gerechtigheid, heer, gerechtigheid, hij geve zijn zweerd af.
Toen deed hij het tegen zijn dank, en, van zijn peerd gestegen zijnde,
werd hij door twee serjanten van de gemeente naar het Steen gebracht.
Doch hij werd niet in de kelders gestoken, maar wel in een getraliede
kamer, alwaar hij, mits betaling, een goed bed en een goed vuur kreeg
en ook goed eten mocht laten halen, van hetwelk de cipier minstens
de helft nam.
IV.
's Anderen daags gingen de baljuw, de beide griffiers-crimineel, twee
schepenen en een chirurgijn-baardemaker langs den kant van Dudzele, om
te zien of zij in den akker van Servaas Vander Vichte het lijk van een
man zouden vinden, langsheen den dijk, dewelke liep door dien kouter.
Nele had tot Katelijne gezeid:
--Hans, uw lieveling, vraagt een afgesneden hand van Hilbert: dezen
avond zal hij schreeuwen als de nachtuil, in onze hut komen en u de
zevenhonderd karolusgulden brengen.
Katelijne had geantwoord:
--De hand zal ik afsnijden.
En, inderdaad, zij nam een mes en ging heen, vergezelschapt door Nele
en gevolgd door de officieren van justitie.
Zij stapte gauw en fier vooruit met Nele, wier liefelijk gezichtje
bloosde van de vinnige koude.
Bibberend en kuchend, volgden heur de officieren van justitie, die
reeds bedaagd waren, en zij allen geleken zwarte schimmen op het
witte veld, en Nele droeg eene spade.
Toen zij bij den akker van Servaas Vander Vichte, op den dijk, gekomen
waren, ging Katelijne naar het midden: daar wees zij naar de meersch,
die op heure rechterhand lag en sprak:
--Hansken, gij wist niet dat ik daar huiverend verborgen was bij 't
wapengekletter. En Hilbert schreeuwde: Dit ijzer is koud. Hilbert is
leelijk. Hans is schoon. Gij zult zijne hand hebben, laat mij alleen!
Zij dwaalde toen links af, zette zich in de sneeuw op de knieën en
schreeuwde driemaal in de lucht, om de geesten aan te roepen.
Nele langde heur toen de spade, op dewelke Katelijne drie kruiskens
maakte; vervolgens teekende zij op de bevroren sneeuw de beeltenis van
eene doodkist, alsmede drie kruisen, één naar het Oosten, één naar het
Westen en één naar het Noorden, en sprak: Drij, dat is Mars omtrent
Saturnus, en drij is ontdekking onder Venus, de heldere sterre. En
vervolgens trok zij rondom de doodkist een grooten kring, zeggende:
--Ga heen, booze duivel, die de lijken bewaart!
Vervolgens knielde zij neder en bad:
--Duivel Hilbert, mijn vriend, zeide zij, Hans, mijn heer en meester,
beveelt mij hier uwe hand af te snijden: ik ben hem gehoorzaamheid
verschuldigd: doe mij niet treffen met het aardsche vuur, omdat ik
uw edele grafstee kom storen, en vergeef het mij in name van God en
zijne santen.
Toen kapte zij in het ijs, naarvolgens het figuur van de doodkist;
zij maakte de natte graszode bloot, vervolgens het zand, en weldra
zagen de heer baljuw, zijne officieren, Nele en Katelijne het lijk
van een jongen man te voorschijn komen, dat wit geworden was als kalk,
ter oorzake van het zand. Hij was gekleed in grijs lakensch wambuis en
een eender opperste kleed; zijn zweerd lag aan zijne zijde. Aan zijnen
gordel had hij eene maliënbeurs, en een breede dolk stak nog in zijn
lichaam, onder het hert; en er was bloed op het laken van het wambuis,
en dat bloed was geloopen tot onder den rug. En de man was nog jong.
Katelijne sneed zijne hand af en stak ze in heure gordeltasch. En de
baljuw liet heur begaan, beval heur vervolgens het lijk te ontdoen
van alle kleederen en kenteekenen. Katelijne vroeg, of Hans zulks
had geheeten, maar de baljuw antwoordde, dat hij slechts handelde
naar zijne bevelen; toen deed Katelijne alles wat hij gebood.
Toen het lijk uitgekleed was, zag men dat het droog lijk hout was:
en de baljuw en de officieren van de gemeente deden het bedekken met
zand en de serjanten droegen de kleederen en de wapenen mede.
En toen zij voorbij het Steen kwamen, zeide de baljuw tot Katelijne,
dat Hans dáár op heur wachtte; en blijde ging zij er binnen.
Nele wilde heur tegenhouden, doch Katelijne antwoordde:
--Ik wil Hans zien, mijn heer en meester.
En Nele weende aan de poort, want zij wist, dat Katelijne als tooveres
aangehouden was om de bezweringen en teekenen, die zij gemaakt had
op de sneeuw.
En men zeide te Damme, dat er voor heur geene ontferming zou zijn.
En Katelijne werd gestoken in een onderaardschen kerker van het Steen.
V.
's Anderen daags woei de wind uit Brabant: de sneeuw smolt en de
meerschen werden overstroomd.
En de burgstorm luidde, om de rechters naar de vierschaar te roepen,
onder het afdak, om den wille van de vochtigheid der zodenbanken.
En het volk stond rond de vierschaar.
Joost Damman werd voorgebracht, zonder kluisters, in zijn prachtige
kleeren. Katelijne werd insgelijks voorgebracht, doch met de handen
van voren gebonden en gekleed in een grijs lijnwaden kleed, hetwelk
de dos der gevangenen was.
Joost Damman, ondervraagd, bekende dat hij zijn vriend Hilbert gedood
had, in tweegevecht, met het zweerd. Als men hem zei, dat hij gedood
was met een dolk, antwoordde Joos Damman:
--Ik heb hem afgemaakt, omdat hij niet gauw genoeg stierf. Dien moord
beken ik gereedelijk, vermits ik sta onder de bescherming der wetten
van Vlaanderen, volgens dewelke, na verloop van tien jaar, de moord
niet meer vervolgd wordt.
De baljuw vroeg hem:
--Zijt gij geen tooveraar?
--Neen, antwoordde Damman.
--Bewijs het, zeide de baljuw.
--Ik zal het doen op tijd en stond, zeide Joost Damman, maar nu past
het mij niet.
Toen werd Katelijne ondervraagd; zij hoorde niet wat men vroeg,
doch keek gedurig naar Hans en sprak:
--Gij zijt mijn groene heer, schoon als de zon zijt ge. Doe het vuur
weg, mijn liefste!
Nele kwam toen Katelijne voorspreken en zeide:
--Heer baljuw en heeren rechters, meer dan gij weet, kan zij niet
bekennen; zij is geene tooveres, doch enkel uitzinnig.
Toen sprak de baljuw:
--Tooveraar is hij, die door voorbedachtelijk gebruikte duivelsche
middelen in iets tracht te slagen. Nu, deze twee, man en vrouw, zijn
tooveraars met inzicht en met daad; hij, omdat hij de sabbatszalve
gegeven, en zijn gezicht helder als Lucifer gemaakt heeft, ten
einde geld en vleeschelijken omgang te bekomen; zij, omdat zij hem
aangehangen heeft, hem nemende voor eenen echten duivel, en omdat
zij met hem gehanteerd heeft; hij is pleger van hekserij, en zij
is zijne baarschuldige. Men mag dus geenerlei ontferming hebben,
en ik moet het zeggen, want ik zie dat de schepenen en die van 't
gemeen te goedertieren zijn jegens de vrouw. In der waarheid heeft zij
gemoord noch gestolen, noch heeft zij personen of hunlieder beestiaal
mishand; ook heeft zij geenerlei zieken met buitengemeene middelen
genezen, maar enkellijk met gekende geneeskruiden; doch zij heeft
heure dochter willen overleveren aan den duivel, en als deze in heur
jeugdigen ouderdom niet met zooveel dapperheid wederstaan had, dan had
zij toegegeven aan Hilbert en ware zij, als de tweede beschuldigde,
insgelijks tooveres geworden. Dienvolgens vraag ik aan de heeren van de
vierschaar of zij niet van oordeel zijn, beiden ter torture te stellen?
De schepenen antwoordden niet, daardoor beduidende, dat zij niet van
dat oordeel waren, wat Katelijne betrof.
Zijne rede vervolgende, zeide toen de baljuw:
--Evenals gij, ben ik voor haar vervuld met ontferming en
medelijden; maar had die krankzinnige tooveres, die zoo goed den
duivel gehoorzaamt, als haar ontuchtige medebeschuldigde het heur had
bevolen, het hoofd heurer dochter niet kunnen afhouwen met een kapmes,
zooals Katelijne Dura, in Frankrijk, met heur twee dochters deed, op
aanzoek van den duivel? Had zij, zoo heur zwarte bruidegom het heur had
bevolen, het beestiaal niet kunnen doen sterven; de boter niet kunnen
doen keeren in de karnton, door er suiker in te smijten; had zij in
lijve niet kunnen tegenwoordig zijn bij alle duivelsvereeringen,
heksendansen, verfoeiselen en koppelingen van tooveraars? Had zij
geen menschenvleesch kunnen eten, geene kinderen kunnen dooden om er
pasteien van te maken en die te verkoopen, gelijk een pasteibakker
van Parijs deed; had zij de braaien der gehangenen niet kunnen
afsnijden en meedragen om ze rauw op te eten, aldus plegende beide
een schromelijken diefstal en eene heiligschennis? En ik vraag aan
de vierschaar Katelijne en Joost Damman op de pijnbank te leggen,
ten einde te weten of zij beiden geenerlei andere misdrijven hebben
gepleegd dan degene, die reeds gekend en onderzocht zijn. Vermits
Joost Damman weigert iets meerder te bekennen dan den moord, en
Katelijne niet alles gezegd heeft, gebieden ons de wetten des Rijks
te handelen naarvolgens mijn voorstel.
En de sententie der schepenen luidde, dat de torture twee dagen later,
des Vrijdags, zou plaats hebben.
En Nele schreeuwde:
--Genade, mijne heeren!
En het volk schreeuwde met heur, doch te vergeefs.
En Katelijne bezag Joost Damman en sprak:
--Ik heb Hilbert's hand, kom ze dezen nacht halen, liefste.
En zij werden terug naar het Steen gebracht.
Op bevel van de vierschaar, werd den cipier geheeten hun elk twee
bewakers te geven, die hen moesten slaan, telkens dat zij zouden willen
slapen; maar de twee bewakers van Katelijne lieten heur den nacht
slapende doorbrengen, en die van Joost Damman sloegen hem wreedelijk
telkens dat hij de oogen look of enkellijk het hoofd vooroverboog.
Heel den Woensdag hadden zij honger, alsook den nacht en heel den
Donderdag, tot 's avonds, als men hun vleesch te eten en water te
drinken gaf, beide bereid met zout en met salpeter. Dat was het begin
der torture. En 's morgens brachten de serjanten de beide gevangenen,
die schreeuwden van dorst, naar de folterkamer.
Daar werden zij rechtover elkander gezet en ieder gebonden op eene
bank, bekleed met knoopkoorden, die hen schromelijk pijnigden.
En ieder moest een glas water drinken, met zout en salpeter er in.
Joost Damman kreeg vaak op zijne bank, maar de serjanten sloegen
hem wakker.
En Katelijne zeide:
--Om Gods wil, slaat hem niet, mijne heeren, gij breekt zijn arm
lichaam. Hij bedreef maar een enkele misdaad, uit liefde, toen hij
Hilbert doodde. Ik heb dorst en gij ook, Hans, mijn beminde! Laat hem
eerst drinken! Water! water! mijn lichaam brandt als vuur. Spaar hem,
ik zal sterven voor hem! Drinken!
Hans zeide tot haar:
--Heks die gij zijt. Heeren rechters, smijt heure kroenge in 't
vuur. Ik heb dorst!
De griffiers schreven al zijne woorden op.
Toen zei de baljuw:
--Hebt gij niets te belijden?
--Ik heb niets meer te zeggen, antwoordde Joost Damman: Gij weet alles.
--Daar hij volherdt in zijn loochenen, zeide de baljuw, zal hij tot
verdere en volledige belijdenis op de koordebank blijven zitten en
zal hij dorst lijden, en men zal hem beletten te slapen.
--Ik zal blijven, zei Joost Damman, en mij vermaken met die tooveres
te zien lijden op heure bank. Hoe vindt gij 't huwelijksbed, nichtje?
En zuchtend antwoordde Katelijne:
--Koud van armen en warm van hert, Hans, mijn welbeminde. Ik heb dorst,
mijn hoofd brandt!
--En gij, vrouwe, sprak de baljuw, hebt gij niets meer te zeggen?
--Ik hoor, zeide zij, de kar van den Dood en een dof gerammel van
beenderen. Ik heb dorst! En Hij leidt mij naar een grooten troon,
waar water is, frisch en klaar water; maar dit water is vuur. Hans,
mijn vriend, verlos mij van die koorden. Ja, ik ben in het vagevuur
en ginder omhoog zie ik Onzen Heer Jezus in het hemelrijk zitten,
met zijn allergenadigste moeder, de Maagd Maria. Ho! Heilige Moeder
Gods, een droppelken water! Eet die sappige vruchten alleen niet op!
--Die vrouw is door wreede uitzinnigheid getroffen, zei een van de
schepenen. Men moet ze van de pijnbank verwijderen.
--Zij is niet uitzinniger dan ik; zei Joost Damman, 't is gehuichel
en gemaakt spel.
En met dreigende stemme, sprak hij tot Katelijne:
--Ik zal u zien branden in 't vuur, u, die zoo goed de uitzinnige
speelt.
En grijnzend, lachte hij om zijn boosaardige leugen.
--Ik heb dorst, zei Katelijne, hebt medelijden, ik heb dorst! Hans
mijn welbeminde, geef mij te drinken. Hoe helder is uw gezicht! Laat
mij tot hem gaan, heeren rechters!
En den mond openspalkend, vervolgde zij, smachtend van dorst:
--Ja, ja, nu steken zij vuur in mijne borst, en de duivelen binden
mij op dit gruwelijk bed. Hans, neem uw zweerd en dood ze, gij,
die zoo machtig zijt. Water! drinken! drinken!
--Sterf, tooveres, zeide Joost Damman: gij moest heur eene prop in
den mond steken om heur, eene vrouw uit 't gemeen, te beletten op te
komen tegen mij, die van adel ben.
Een schepen, vijand des adels, antwoordde op deze rede:
--Heer baljuw, het is strijdig met de rechten en costumen van den
lande, proppen te steken in den mond van hen, die men ondervraagt, want
zij zijn hier om de waarheid te zeggen en gevonnist te worden volgens
hunne rede. Proppen zijn maar toegelaten wanneer de beschuldigde,
veroordeeld zijnde, van op het schavot tot het volk spreken wil,
om het te vermurwen of gisting onder het gemeen te verwekken.
--Ik heb dorst, zeide Katelijne, geef mij te drinken, Hans, mijn
liefste.
--Ha! sprak Joost, gij lijdt, vervloekte heks, eenige schuld van al
mijne tormenten; maar in deze folterkamer zult gij nog andere smerten
verduren: de keersen, de wipgalg, de stokskens tusschen de vingeren en
tusschen de teenen. Men zal u, ganschelijk naakt, schrijlings zetten
op den rug eener doodkist, scherp als het lemmer van een mes, en dan
zult gij belijden dat gij geene uitzinnige zijt, maar een tooveres,
door Satan betaald om den edellieden last aan te doen. Drinken!
--Hans, mijn beminde, sprak Katelijne opnieuw, wees niet grammoedig
jegens uwe dienares; ik lijd duizenden pijnen voor u, mijn heer en
meester! Spaart hem, heeren rechters: geeft hem een vollen beker te
drinken, maar laat eenige droppelen over voor mij. Hans, is 't reeds
het uur van den nachtuil?
Toen vroeg de baljuw aan Joost Damman:
--Welke was de reden van het tweegevecht, waarin Hilbert den dood vond?
Joost antwoordde:
--Wij vochten om een meideken van Heist, dat wij beiden beminden.
--Een meideken van Heist, riep Katelijne, die met geweld van de
bank wilde opstaan, gij bedriegt mij dus met eene andere, helsche
verrader?... Wist gij dat ik stond te luisteren, achter den dijk,
toen gij zegdet dat gij al het geld wildet hebben, hetwelk het geld
was van Klaas? 't Was zeker om het met heur te verteren? Laas! en ik,
die mijn bloed had gegeven, als hij er goud had kunnen van maken! En
alles voor eene andere! Wees gevloekt!
Doch plotseling begon zij te weenen, en zij poogde zich om te keeren
op de folterbank:
--Neen, Hans, zeg dat gij uwe arme dienares noch zult liefhebben, en de
aarde zal ik met mijne vingeren openkrabben; een schat zal ik u vinden;
ja, een schat is verborgen; en ik zal zoeken met het hazelaarstakje,
hetwelk nederbuigt als het boven metaal wordt gehouden; en ik zal
hem vinden en hem u eerlijk brengen; kus mij, liefste, en gij zult
rijk wezen; en alle dagen zullen wij kuite drinken; ja, ja, zij, die
daar zitten, drinken ook bier, schuimend bier, dat verkwikt! O! mijne
heeren, een dropje slechts, ik brand in het vuur! Hans, ik weet waar
hazelaars groeien, maar gij moet wachten tot in den voortijd.
--Zwijg, ellendige, zei Joost Damman, ik ken u niet. Hilbert hebt
gij genomen voor mij: hij is 't die boven bij u kwam. En, met uw
helschen geest, hiet gij hem Hans. Weet dat ik niet Hans heet, maar
Joost: wij waren van dezelfde grootte, Hilbert en ik; 't was Hilbert,
waarschijnlijk, die de zevenhonderd karolussen nam. Drinken! mijn
vader zal honderd gulden betalen voor een kroezeken water; maar die
vrouw ken ik niet!
--Heer baljuw en heeren rechters, riep Katelijne uit, hij beweert dat
hij mij niet kent; maar ik, ik ken hem wel en weet, dat hij op den
rug een bruine, harige geboortevlek heeft, groot als een erwt. Ha! gij
bemindet een meideken van Heist! Hoeft een oprecht minnaar voor zijn
geliefde te blozen? Hans, ben ik niet meer schoon?
--Schoon! grijnslachte Damman, gij hebt een gezicht, glad als eene
mispel, en een lichaam, slank als eene vim takkebossen: bezie mij
die schooister, die beweert een edelman tot minnaar te hebben! Drinken!
--Zoo spraakt ge niet, Hans, mijn beminde heer en meester, als ik
zestien jaar jonger was.
Vervolgens op heur hoofd en heure borst kloppend, sprak zij:
--'t Is het vuur, dat daar is, dat mijn hert en mijn gezicht
verschroeit: verwijt het mij niet; weet gij nog dat wij veel van
zout eten hielden, om beter te kunnen drinken, naar gij zeidet? Nu is
al het zout in ons lijf, mijn beminde, en mijnheer de baljuw drinkt
wijn. Wij vragen geen wijn: geeft ons water. In de beemde kabbelt het
heldere beekje met zijn frisch, lekker water. Neen, dat water kookt,
het verbrandt mij! 't Is water uit de helle!
En Katelijne weende en zij sprak:
--Nooit deed ik iemand leed, en iedereen smijt mij in 't
vuur. Drinken! de straathonden krijgen water; ik ben een kerstene
vrouw, geeft mij te drinken. Nooit deed ik iemand leed! Geeft mij
toch te drinken!
Toen sprak een schepen:
--Die tooveres is alleenlijk uitzinnig wat betreft het vuur, dat
brandt in heur hoofd, naar zij zegt, maar voor alle andere dingen
is zij het niet, vermits zij met helderen geest ons het lijk van den
verslagene hielp ontdekken. Als Joost Damman inderdaad een harige vlek
heeft op zijnen rug, is dit merk voldoende om zijne eenzelvigheid te
doen vaststellen met den duivel Hans, op denwelken Katelijne verliefd
was. Beul, toon ons het merk op den rug.
De hangman ontblootte den hals en den schouder, en toonde de bruine,
harige vlek.
--Ha! sprak Katelijne, hoe wit is uwe huid! zou men niet zeggen dat
het de schouderen eener maagd zijn? Wat zijt gij schoon, Hans, mijn
beminde! Drinken!
Toen stak de hangman een lange naald in het merk, doch er kwam geen
bloed uit.
En de schepenen zeiden tot elkander:
--Dat is een duivel, en hij zal Joost Damman vermoord hebben en
zijn aanschijn genomen, om des te veiliger de arme lieden te kunnen
bedriegen.
En de baljuw en de schepenen schrikten:
--Hij is een duivel, en er is een tooverteeken.
En Joost Damman sprak:
--Gij weet wel dat dit geen tooverteeken is, maar dat er vleezige
uitwassen bestaan, in dewelke men mag steken, zonder dat zij
bloeden. Heeft Hilbert die tooveres geld ontfutseld,--want tooveres is
zij, die belijdt met den duivel te hebben geslapen--zoo deed hij het
met de algeheele toestemming van die boerin en werd hij, edelman,
om zijne kussen betaald, gelijk zulks telkendage gebeurt met de
meidekens van pleizier. Zijn er geene mannen, die, als de loddegen,
de vrouwen hunne kracht en hunne schoonheid met geld doen betalen?
De schepenen zeiden tot elkaar:
--Hoort gij zijn duivelsche, stoutmoedige listen? Zijn harige wrat
heeft niet gebloed: moordenaar, duivel en tooveraar, wil hij enkellijk
de schuld van het tweegevecht bekennen, om al zijn andere misdaden
te schuiven op zijn vriend den duivel, dien hij gedood heeft naar
lichaam, maar geenszins naar ziel.... En ziet eens hoe bleek zijn
gezicht is.--Aldus verschijnen al de duivelen, rood in de helle, bleek
op de wereld, want zij hebben geen levensvuur, dat aan het gezicht zijn
natuurlijken blos geeft, en zij zijn assche van binnen.--Om hem rood te
krijgen en hem te doen branden, moet men hem terug op het vuur zetten.
Toen sprak Katelijne:
--Ja, duivel is hij, doch een goede, zoete duivel! En de heilige
Joannes, zijn patroon, heeft hem de toelating gegeven de helle te
verlaten. Alle dagen bidt hij den Heer Jezus voor hem. Hij moet maar
zeven duizend jaar vagevuur meer doen: de Moeder Gods wil het, maar
Satan verzet er zich tegen. Doch Maria drijft door wat zij wil. Zult
gijlieden u verzetten tegen heuren wil? Als gij hem goed beziet,
zult gij merken, dat hij niets meer heeft van zijn duivelschen staat,
uitgenomen zijn ijskoud lichaam, en ook zijn gezicht, dat glanst lijk,
in de oogstmaand, de branding der zee, als donder op handen is.
En Joost Damman sprak:
--Zwijg, tooveres, gij doet mij verbranden!
Vervolgens zeide hij tot den baljuw en tot de schepenen:
--Aanziet mij, ik ben geen duivel; ik heb vleesch en been, bloed en
water. Ik drink en eet, verteer en werp uit lijk gijlie; mijn vel is
gelijk het uwe en mijn voet insgelijks; beul, trek mijne schoenen uit,
want met mijn gebonden voeten kan ik mij niet verroeren.
De hangman deed het, niet zonder schrik.
--Ziet, zeide Joost, terwijl hij zijn blanke voeten liet zien: zijn dat
gespleten klauwen, zijn dat duivelspooten? Wat mijne bleekheid betreft,
is niemand uwer zoo bleek als ik ben? Ik zie er meer dan drie onder
ulieden. Maar die zondigde was niet ik, doch die leelijke tooveres en
heure dochter, de boosaardige aanbrengster. Waar haalde zij het geld,
dat zij leende aan Hilbert; van waar kwamen de florijnen, die zij
hem gaf? Waren die niet het loon van den duivel, om de onschuldige
edellieden aan te klagen en te doen sterven? Het is aan die beide
vrouwen dat gij moet vragen, wie den hond in de lochting verworgde,
wie den schat uit den put nam en er mee heenging, wellicht om de
gestolen karolussen ergens elders te verbergen. Soetkin, de weduwe,
kon geen vertrouwen stellen in mij, daar zij mij niet kende, doch wel
in haarlieden, bij dewelken zij heel den dag vertoefde. Zij beiden
zijn het, die het goed van den keizer hebben gestolen.
--Vrouwe, hebt gij niets te zeggen tot uwe verdediging?
Katelijne keek naar Joost Damman en zeide met liefde:
--'t Is het uur van den nachtuil! Hans, mijn welbeminde, ik heb de
hand van Hilbert. Zij zeggen, dat gij de zevenhonderd karolussen
zult teruggeven.
... Doet het vuur weg, doet het vuur weg! kermde zij
vervolgens. Drinken! drinken! mijn hoofd brandt! God en de engelen
eten appelsienen in 't hemelrijk.
En zij viel in bezwijming.
--Neem ze weg van de pijnbank, beval de baljuw.
De hangman en zijne knechts gehoorzaamden. Men zag ze wankelen,
met gezwollen voeten, want de beul had de koorden te hard gespannen.
--Geef heur te drinken, beval de baljuw.
Men gaf heur versch water, hetwelk zij gretig dronk, met den beker
tusschen heure tanden, als een hond doet met een been, zonder hem te
willen loslaten. Vervolgens gaf men heur nog water, en zij wilde er
van dragen aan Joost Damman, maar de beul rukte heur den beker uit
de hand. En zij viel slapend ten gronde, als een blok lood.
Toen riep Joost Damman met woede:
--Ik ook heb dorst en heb vaak. Waarom laat gij heur drinken en slapen?
--Zij is eene vrouw, en daarbij zwak en uitzinnig, antwoordde de
baljuw.
--Heure uitzinnigheid is geveinsd, zeide Joost Damman, zij is eene
tooveres. Ik wil drinken, ik wil slapen!
En hij sloot de oogen, maar de beulsknechten sloegen hem in het
gezicht.
--Geef mij een mes, riep hij, dat ik al dien gemeenen boeren en
burgers de les spelle: ik ben een edelman en nooit sloeg men mij in het
gezicht. Water! laat mij slapen, ik ben onschuldig. Ik ben het niet,
die de zevenhonderd karolussen stal: 't is Hilbert. Drinken! Nooit
bedreef ik tooverij of bezwering. Ik ben onschuldig, laat mij
gaan. Drinken!
Toen vroeg de baljuw:
--Hoe bracht gij den tijd door, sedert dat gij Katelijne verliet?
--Katelijne ken ik niet en heb ze dus niet verlaten, zeide hij. Gij
ondervraagt mij over stukken, die vreemd aan de zaak zijn. Ik moet
u niet antwoorden. Drinken! Laat mij slapen! Ik zeg u, dat Hilbert
alles gedaan heeft.
--Maakt hem los, sprak de baljuw. Brengt hem terug naar het Steen. Maar
hij zal drinken noch slapen, totdat hij zijne tooverij en bezwering
bekend heeft.
En voor Damman was dit een schromelijke foltering. In den kerker
schreeuwde hij zoo luide: "Drinken! Drinken!" dat het volk het
hoorde, doch zonder mededoogen. En als hij viel van de vaak en zijne
bewakers hem in het gezicht sloegen, werd hij woedend als een tijger
en riep hij:
--Ik ben een edelman en zal u allen dooden, boeren! Ik zal gaan bij
den koning, onzen hoofdman. Drinken!
Doch hij beleed niets, en men liet hem in het Steen.
VI.
Toen was men in de Bloeimaand; de boom der justitie was groen,
insgelijks groen waren de banken van graszoden, op dewelke de rechters
waren gezeten. Nele werd ter oorkondschap geroepen. Dien dag moest
het vonnis uitgesproken worden.
En het volk: mannen, vrouwlieden, poorters en arbeiders stonden rond
de vierschaar; en de zonne scheen helder.
Katelijne en Joost Damman werden voor de vierschaar gebracht; en
Damman zag er nog bleeker uit, ter oorzake van de torture, van den
dorst en van de slapelooze nachten.
Katelijne, die zich op heure waggelende beenen niet rechthouden kon,
wees naar de zonne en sprak:
--Doe het vuur weg, mijn hoofd brandt!
En met teedere liefde zag zij naar Joost Damman.
En deze bekeek heur met haat en verachting.
En de heeren en edelen, zijne vrienden, die naar Damme waren ontboden,
waren allen als getuigen voor de vierschaar aanwezig.
Toen sprak de baljuw:
--Nele, de dochter, die heure moeder Katelijne met zooveel
genegenheid verdedigt, heeft in den genaaiden zak van den besten rok
derzelfde Katelijne een briefje gevonden, geteekend "Hansken". In de
beugeltassche, gevonden op het lijk van Hilbert Rijnvisch, stak een
andere brief, aan hem gezonden door Joost Damman, beschuldigde alhier
tegenwoordig. Beide brieven heb ik bewaard, opdat gij op het gepaste
oogenblik, dat thans aangebroken is, zoudt kunnen oordeelen over
de hardnekkigheid van dien man en hem vrijspreken of veroordeelen,
naarvolgens wet en gerechtigheid. Hier is het perkament, in de
beugeltasch gevonden; ik deed het niet open en weet niet of het
leesbaar is of niet.
Toen waren de rechters in groote verlegenheid.
De baljuw beproefde het bolleken perkament los te maken, doch te
vergeefs; en Joost Damman schompermuilde.
Toen sprak een schepen:
--Laat ons het bolleken in 't water leggen en vervolgens voor
't vuur stellen. Als het door een heimelijk middel toegeplakt is,
zullen water en vuur het wel losmaken.
Het water werd gebracht, de hangman stak een groot houtvuur aan;
de blauwe rook steeg recht omhoog in den helderen hemel, tusschen de
groene takken van den boom der justitie.
--Steek den brief in de kom niet, sprak een schepen, want als hij
geschreven is met opgelost ammoniakzout, zullen de letteren verdwijnen.
--Neen, zeide een chirurgijn, die daar was, de letteren zullen niet
verdwijnen, het water zal enkellijk het bestrijksel, hetwelk dit
tooverbolleken toeplakt, weeker maken.
Het perkament werd geweekt in het water, en, als het zachter was,
werd het geopend.
--Nu, zeide de chirurgijn, houdt het nu voor het vuur.
--Ja, ja, zeide Nele, houdt het papier voor het vuur; messire
chirurgijn is op weg naar de waarheid, want de moordenaar verbleekt,
en siddert over heel zijn lichaam.
Daarop sprak Joost Damman:
--Ik verbleek noch ik sidder, kleine heks uit 't gemeen, die op den
dood van een edelman aast; maar gij zult er niet in slagen: dat papier
moet gerot zijn na zestien jaar verblijf in den grond.
--Het perkament is geenszins bedorven, zei de schepen, de beugeltasch
was met zijde gevoerd; zijde vergaat niet in den grond, en de wormen
hebben het perkament niet opgegeten.
Het perkament werd voor 't vuur gebracht.
--Heer baljuw, heer baljuw, zeide Nele, hier voor het vuur komen
reeds letteren te voorschijn: beveel dat men het schrift leze.
De chirurgijn nam het perkament om het te lezen, als messire Joost
Damman vlug de hand uitstak om het te grijpen; doch rap als de wind
hield Nele zijnen arm tegen, en zij sprak:
--Gij zult het niet aanraken, want daar staat uw dood of die van
Katelijne geschreven. Bloedt thans uw herte, moordenaar, weet dat het
onze reeds vijftien jaar lang bloedt; 't is vijftien jaar dat Katelijne
lijdt, dat heur geest in heur hoofd verbrand werd om uwentwil; 't
is vijftien jaar dat Soetkin stierf ten gevolge der smerten; 't is
vijftien jaar dat wij leven in kommer en ellende, hoewel wij fier het
hoofd mogen verheffen. Lees het papier, lees het papier! De rechters
zijn God op de wereld, want zij zijn Gerechtigheid. Lees het papier!
--Lees het papier! riepen de mannen en vrouwlieden snikkend. Nele is
moedig en braaf! Katelijne is geene tooveres.
En de griffier las:
"Aan Hilbert, zoon van Willem Rijnvisch, schildknaap, Joost Damman,
schildknaap, Heil!
... Waarde vriend, verlies uw geld niet meer met kaarten, dobbelsteenen
en andere dergelijke kansspelen. Ik zal u zeggen hoe men zeker is
altijd geld te winnen: Laat ons duivelen worden, schoone duivelen,
bemind door vrouwen en meidekens. De schoone en rijke vrouwlieden
zullen wij nemen en de leelijken en armen daar laten; zij hebben heur
genoegen maar te betalen. Op die wijze maakte ik in Duitschland, in zes
maanden, vijfduizend rijksdaalders. De vrouwen zouden zich uitkleeden
voor den man, dien zij liefhebben; vlied de gierige feeksen, die met
tegenzin heur pleizier betalen. Wat u betreft, om schoon te wezen en
een echte nachtduivel te schijnen, kondig uwe komst aan met 't gekras
van eenen roofvogel, als zij u in het duister willen ontvangen. En om
u een gezicht te maken van een echten, verschrikkelijken duivel, wrijf
het in met phosphorus, die bij plaatsen schittert als hij nat is. Hij
stinkt, maar de vrouwen nemen dat voor den reuk van het solfer der
helle. Dood al wie u hindert: 't zij man, 't zij vrouw of 't zij beest.
... Binnen kort gaan wij samen bij Katelijne, een schoone, goedhertige
loddege; heure dochter, Nele, een kind van mij, als Katelijne mij
trouw was, is een lief en beminnelijk meideken; zonder moeite zult
gij ze nemen; ik schenk ze u, want ik geef niet om bastaards: men
kan ze nooit met zekerheid voor zijn kroost erkennen. Heure moeder
gaf mij reeds meer dan drie en twintig karolussen, gansch heure
have. Maar zij verbergt eenen schat, die, als ik het goed voorheb,
het erfdeel van Klaas is, den ketter, die te Damme levend verbrand
werd: zevenhonderd karolussen, waar verbeurdverklaring op rust;
doch de goede koning Philippus, die zoovele zijner onderdanen deed
verbranden om te erven van hen, kon dien lieven schat in zijne klauwen
niet krijgen. Hij zal zwaarder wegen in mijne tassche dan in de zijne;
Katelijne zal mij zeggen waar hij is; wij zullen hem deelen. Maar gij
moet mij 't grootste deel laten, omdat ik de aanbrenger ben. Wat de
vrouwen betreft, dewelke onze zachtmoedige dienaressen en verliefde
slavinnen zullen wezen, die zullen wij naar Duitschland brengen. Daar
zullen wij van heur nachtduivelinnetjes maken, en ze laten beslapen
door alle rijke poorters en edellieden; wij en haarlieden zullen
daar leven van de liefde, betaald met schoone rijksdaalders, panne,
zijde, goud, perelen en juweelen; zoo worden wij, buiten weten van
onze duivelinnetjes, bemind door de schoonsten onder de schoonen,
en doen wij heur steeds voor onze liefde betalen. Al de vrouwen zijn
zot en dwaselijk verknocht aan den man, die in haar het liefdevuur
doet ontvlammen, hetwelk God onder heuren gordel stak. Katelijne en
Nele zullen het nog meer wezen dan iemand, en zullen ons in alles
gehoorzamen: behoud uwen voornaam, maar voer nooit den naam van uwen
vader Rijnvisch. Neemt de rechter de vrouwen in hechtenis, dadelijk
vertrekken wij zonder dat zij ons kennen of kunnen verraden. Help
mij, mijne getrouwe. De fortuin lacht de jongelieden toe, zeide Zijne
Heilige Majesteit Keizer Karel zaliger, dewelke een meester was in
zaken van liefde en van oorlog".
En de griffier hield op met lezen en sprak:
--Zoo luidt de brief en hij is geteekend: "Joost Damman, schildknaap".
En het volk riep:
--Ter dood, de moordenaar! Ter dood, de tooveraar! In 't vuur, de
schavuit, die de vrouwlieden waanzinnig maakt! Aan de galg, de rabauw!
Toen sprak de baljuw:
--Zwijg, volk, opdat wij dien man in volle vrijheid kunnen oordeelen.
En tot de schepenen zeide hij:
--Ik wil u den tweeden brief lezen, dien Nele vond in den zak van
Katelijne's besten rok; hij luidt als volgt:
"Geliefde tooveres, ziehier het recept eener zalve, dat de vrouw van
Lucifer zelve mij zond: met die zalve zult gij u kunnen begeven in
de zonne, de maan en de sterren; kunnen spreken met de sylphen, die
aan God de gebeden der menschen overbrengen, en alle steden, dorpen,
rivieren, beemden van 't gansche heelal kunnen bezoeken. Stamp
ondereen, bij gelijke deelen, stramonium, solanum somniferum,
bilzenkruid, opium, versche henneptoppen, belladonna en datura.
... Als gij wilt, zullen wij dezen avond samen naar den sabbat der
geesten gaan: maar gij moet mij meerder beminnen en zoo gierig niet
zijn, gelijk dien avond, toen gij mij tien gulden weigerdet, onder
voorwendsel dat gij ze niet hadt. Ik weet, dat gij eenen schat verbergt
en het mij niet wilt bekennen. Bemint gij mij niet meer, mijne liefste?
"Uw koude duivel,
"Hansken".
--Ter dood, de tooveraar! riep het volk.
De baljuw sprak:
--Wij moeten de twee schriften vergelijken.
Dit werd gedaan, en zij werden eender bevonden.
Toen sprak de baljuw tot de aanwezige heeren en edellieden:
--Herkent gij den beklaagde voor messire Joost Damman, zoon van den
schepene van de keure van Gent?
--Ja, zeiden zij.
--Kendet gij, sprak hij, messire Hilbert, zoon van Willem Rijnvisch,
schildknaap?
Een der edellieden, die Vander Zickele hiet, nam het woord en sprak:
--Ik ben van Gent, mijn steen staat op de Hoogpoort; ik ken Willem
Rijnvisch, schepene van de keure van Gent. Hij verloor, over een
vijftiental jaren, een zoon van drie en twintig jaar, een losbol,
een speler, een luierik; maar men vergaf hem zijne gebreken, om den
wille van zijn jeugdigen leeftijd. Sedert dien tijd kreeg nooit iemand
miede van hem. Ik vraag om het zweerd, den dolk en de beugeltassche
van den verslagene te zien.
Toen hij die voor zich had, sprak hij:
--Op den knop van het hecht van het zweerd en den dolk staan de
wapenen van het geslacht Rijnvisch, hetwelk voert, in blauw, drie
zilveren visschen. Die zelfde wapenen zie ik op een gouden schild
tusschen de maliën der beugeltassche. Welke is die andere dolk?
De baljuw sprak:
--Die dolk stak in het lichaam van Hilbert Rijnvisch, zoon van Willem.
--Daarop herken ik de wapens der Damman's: in zilver, een roode toren.
--Zoo waarlijk helpe mij God almachtig!
De andere edellieden zeiden insgelijks:
--Die wapenen herkennen wij voor die van Rijnvisch en van Damman. Zoo
helpen ons God en al zijne santen!
Toen zei de baljuw:
--Gehoord en gelezen de voor de Vierschaar gebrachte getuigenissen
en oorkonden, is naar rechte ten genoege gebleken, dat Joost
Damman, "gecommitteerd hebbende de crimen van tooverije, doodslag,
zotmaking van vrouwlieden, diefte van 's konings goedingen, wezende
de abominabelste zonden die men ter wereld kan bedrijven, schuldig
is aan crimen divinae laesae majestatis, geenszins lijdelijk zonder
exemplaire pugnitie".
--Dat zegt gij, messire baljuw, hernam Joost, doch bij gebreke aan
genoegzame bewijzen, kunt gij mij niet veroordeelen; tooveraar ben ik
niet of was ik nooit; enkellijk speelde ik het spel van den duivel. Wat
mijn helder gezicht betreft, nu weet gij het middel, dat ik daartoe
gebruikte. De zalve, hoewel zij bilzenkruid, een vergiftige plant,
bevat, is enkel slaapverwekkend. Als die vrouw, die een ware tooveres
is, er van nam, verviel zij in slaapdronkenheid en droomde zij, dat
zij naar den sabbat ging en er danste met het gezicht buitenwaarts
van de ronde, alsook dat zij eenen duivel aanbad in de gedaante van
eenen bok, op een autaar gezeten. Als de rondedans gedaan was, droomde
zij, dat zij den duivel ging kussen onder zijnen steert, gelijk de
tooveraars doen, tot teeken van onderdanigheid. Als ik, naar zij zegt,
koude armen en een frisch lichaam had, is dit een teeken van jeugd
en geenszins van tooverij. Frischheid is niet bestand tegen het werk
des vleesches. Maar Katelijne nam heure wenschen voor werkelijkheid
en aanzag mij dus voor eenen duivel, hoewel ik een mensch ben, gelijk
gijlie. Zij alleen is schuldig om mij, voor eenen duivel nemende, in
heur bed aanveerd te hebben; aldus zondigde zij met wil en met daad
tegen God en tegen den Heiligen Geest. Zij dus is het, maar ik niet,
die de misdaad van tooverij beging, die strafbaar is met den viere, als
een razende en boosaardige tooveres, die voor uitzinnig wil doorgaan,
ten einde heure boosaardigheid te verbergen.
Doch Nele riep:
--Hoort gij den moordenaar? Als loddegen, als veile deernen, dewelke
een schijfje op den arm dragen, dreef hij handel in liefde. Hoort
gij hem? om zich te redden, wil hij degene doen verbranden, welke
hem alles gaf.
--Nele is stout, zeide Katelijne, Hans, mijn liefste, luister naar
heur niet.
--Neen, vervolgde Nele, gij zijt geen mensch: gij zijt een lafhertige,
wreedaardige duivel!
En, Katelijne in de armen nemend:
--Heeren rechters, riep zij, luistert niet naar dien bleeken booswicht;
hij heeft maar éénen wensch: mijne moeder levend te zien verbranden,
hoewel zij geen andere misdaad bedreef, dan door God met uitzinnigheid
getroffen te worden en de schimmen heurer droomen voor echt te
aanzien. Veel reeds heeft zij geleden naar lichaam en geest. Doet ze
niet sterven, heeren rechters. Laat de uitzinnige heur treurig leven
eindigen in vrede.
En Katelijne sprak:
--Nele is stout, ge moet ze niet gelooven, Hansken, mijn vriend.
En in het volk weenden de vrouwlieden en riepen de mannen:
--Genade voor Katelijne!
Op belijdenissen, die Joost Damman na nieuwe folteringen deed, brachten
de baljuw en de schepenen hunne sententie te zijnen opzichte uit:
hij werd veroordeeld om te worden ontadeld en levend verbrand met
zacht vuur, totdat de dood er op volgde.
's Anderen daags doorstond hij de doodstraf voor de pui van het
Schepenhuis, gedurig roepend:
--Doet de tooveres sterven; zij alleen is schuldig. Gevloekt weze
God! mijn vader zal de rechters vermoorden!
En hij gaf den geest.
En het volk zeide:
--Hoort hoe hij God vloekt en lastert, hij sterft als een hond.
's Anderen daags brachten de baljuw en de schepenen hun vonnis uit
ten opzichte van Katelijne: zij werd veroordeeld om de waterproef
te doorstaan, in de Brugsche vaart. Zoo zij boven dreef, zou zij als
tooveres worden verbrand; zoo zij zonk en stierf, zou zij beschouwd
worden als op kerstene wijze gestorven en als dusdanig op 't kerkhof
begraven.
's Anderen daags werd Katelijne, baarvoets, gekleed met een zwart
linnen hemde, en met eene waskeers in heure hand, processiegewijs
gebracht tot aan de vaart, langsheen de boomen. Vóór heur gingen,
de gebeden der dooden zingend, de deken van Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk,
zijne vicarissen, de koster met het kruis; en achter heur, de baljuw
van Damme, de schepenen, de griffiers, de serjanten der gemeente,
de provoost, de hangman en zijne beide knechts. Op de beide oevers
stond een groote menigte vrouwen, die weenden, en mannen, die morden,
uit medelijden met Katelijne, dewelke gedwee als een lam zich liet
leiden zonder te weten waarheen, en gedurig zei:
--Doet het vuur weg, mijn hoofd brandt! Hansken, waar zijt gij?
Nele, die te midden van de vrouwen stond, riep:
--Ik wil met heur in 't water worden gesmeten!
Maar de vrouwen lieten heur omtrent Katelijne niet komen.
Een scherpe wind blies van de zee; een fijne hagel viel uit
den loodgrijzen hemel in het water der vaart; eene boot lag daar
vastgemeerd; de hangman en zijne knechts namen dezelve in naam Zijner
Koninklijke Majesteit. Op hun bevel stapte Katelijne er in: de beul
stond recht in de boot en hield Katelijne vast, en, op een teeken van
den provoost met de roede der justitie, smeet hij ze in de vaart. Zij
spartelde, doch niet lang, en zonk nog roepende:
--Hans! Hans! help mij!
En het volk zeide:
--Die vrouw is geene tooveres.
Mannen sprongen in de vaart en trokken Katelijne er uit, dewelke
van heurzelve was en stijf als eene doode. Zij werd in eene taveerne
gebracht en voor een groot vuur nedergelegd; Nele trok heur nat hemd
uit en deed heur een ander aan; toen zij tot zich zelve kwam, zegde
zij bibberend en klappertandend:
--Hans, geef mij een wollen mantel.
En Katelijne kon zich niet verwarmen. En den derden dag stierf zij. En
zij werd op 't kerkhof begraven, in gewijde aarde.
En Nele toog henen naar Holland, bij Rosa van Auweghem.
VII.
Op de hulken, op de boeiers, de poonen der Geuzen, vaart Thijl Klaas
Uilenspiegel.
De vrije zee draagt de wakkere vliebooten, op dewelke acht, tien,
tot twintig ijzeren stukken staan: zij braken dood en vernieling naar
de verraderlijke Spanjolen.
Hij is een ervaren kanonnier, Thijl Uilenspiegel, zoon van Klaas:
het is een lust te zien hoe juist hij het stuk richt, hoe goed hij
mikt, en, als in boter, een gat boort in de schepen der beulen.
Op den vilten hoed draagt hij de zilveren halvemaan met het opschrift:
Liever den Turc als den Paus.
De matrozen, die hem, vlug als eene kat, met een referein op de lippen,
op hunne boot zagen springen, ondervroegen hem nieuwsgieriglijk:
--Hoe komt het, maat, dat gij er nog zoo jeugdig uitziet, want men
zegt, dat het reeds lang geleden is dat gij te Damme ter wereld kwaamt?
--Ik ben geen lichaam, maar een geest, zei hij, en Nele, mijne
vriendinne, gelijkt mij. Geest van Vlaanderen, Liefde van Vlaanderen,
zullen wij beiden nooit sterven.
--Maar, zeiden zij, als men u snijdt, bloedt gij toch?
--Schijn bedriegt, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, het is wijn, maar geen
bloed.
En de geborduurde banieren uit de ommegangen der Roomschen wapperden
aan de masten der schepen. En gekleed in panne, in brocaat, in zijde,
in goud- en zilverlaken, met mijter en staf, den wijn der monniken
drinkend, hielden de Geuzen de wacht op hunne schepen.
En 't was een vreemdsoortig schouwspel, uit de mouwen der rijke
kleederen die ruwe handen te zien steken, dewelke bogen of bussen,
hellebaarden of pieken droegen, en al die mannen met stuursche
tronie, met flikkerende pistolen en kruismessen in den gordelriem,
uit gouden kelken den wijn der abten te zien drinken, die nu de wijn
der vrijheid was.
En zij zongen en riepen: "Vive le Geus!" en dobberden aldus op het
ruime sop.
VIII.
Te dien tijde namen de Geuzen, onder dewelke Lamme en Uilenspiegel
waren, het stedeken Gorkum. En zij waren aangevoerd door kapitein
Marinus. Deze Marinus, die vroeger dijkwerker was, was weergaloos
trotsch en verwaand en teekende met Gaspard Turk, de verdediger van
Gorkum, eene capitulatie, bij dewelke Turk, de monniken, poorters en
soldaten, die binnen de vesting waren, vrijelijk zouden mogen uitgaan
met den kogel in den mond, het musket op den schouder, met alles
wat zij zouden kunnen dragen, uitgenomen de goedingen van kerken en
kloosters, die aan de belegeraars moesten komen.
Maar, op bevel van messire Lumey, wederhield kapitein Marinus negentien
monniken; alleen de soldaten en poorters liet hij gaan.
En Uilenspiegel sprak:
--Soldatenwoord moet gulden woord wezen. Waarom breekt hij het zijne?
Een oude Geus antwoordde hem:
--De monniken zijn de zonen Satans, de melaatschheid der landen, de
schande der volken. Sedert de komst van den bloedigen hertog, spelen
dezen hier den baas in Gorkum. Onder hen is er een, paap Nicolaas,
dewelke fier is als een pauw en wreed als een tijger. Telkenmale dat
hij over de straat ging met zijn monstrans, waarin zijn met hondevet
gebakken ouwel stak, keek hij met grammoedige oogen naar de huizen, uit
dewelke de vrouwen niet kwamen om neder te knielen, en kloeg hij bij
den rechter al degenen aan, die de knie niet bogen voor zijnen afgod
van water en bloem. De andere monniken volgden zijn voorbeeld. Dat
was de oorzaak van vele gruweldaden, verbrandingen en andere wreede
folteringen in het stedeken Gorkum. Kapitein Marinus deed wèl van die
monniken gevangen te houden, die anderszins, met hunne gelijken, in
vlekken, steden en gehuchten zouden gaan, om te preeken tegen ons, het
volk op te hitsen en de arme hervormden te doen verbranden. Bloedhonden
legt men aan de keten totdat zij verrekken; aan de keten, de monniken;
aan de keten, de bloedhonden van den hertog van Alva; in den kerker,
de beulen! Vive le Geus!
--Maar, sprak Uilenspiegel, Oranje, onze prins van de vrijheid, wil
dat men, bij elke overgave, de goedingen der menschen en het vrije
geweten eerbiedige.
De oude geuzen antwoordden:
--De admiraal wil dat niet voor de monniken: hij is de meester:
hij nam den Briel. In den kerker, de monniken!
--Soldatenwoord is gulden woord! Waarom schendt hij zijn
woord? antwoordde Uilenspiegel. De monniken, die in den kerker worden
gehouden, zijn aan de grofste beleedigingen blootgesteld.
--De assche klopt niet meer op uw hert, spraken zij: ten gevolge van
de edicten, hebben honderdduizend gezinnen de ambachten, de nijverheid
onzer landen, overgebracht naar het Noordwesten, naar Engeland; betoon
maar medelijden voor de bewerkers van onzen ondergang! Sedert Keizer
Karel V, Beul I, en, onder den huidigen, bloedigen koning, Beul II,
stierven honderd achttien duizend menschen den marteldood. Wie droeg de
keersen bij de begrafenissen, in den moorden in de tranen? Monniken en
Spaansche soldeniers! Hoort gij, hoort gij de zielen der slachtoffers
niet klagen en kermen in het kille graf?
--De assche klopt op mijn hert, zeide Uilenspiegel. Soldatenwoord is
gulden woord!
--Wie dan, zeiden zij, wilde door excommunicatie ons in den ban van
alle landen sluiten? Wie had hemel en aarde, God en duivel en hunne
dichte gelederen santen en santinnen tegen ons afgezonden? Wie spatte
er droppelen ossenbloed op de ouwels, wie deed de houten heiligen
weenen? Wie deed het de Profundis zingen over den grond onzer vaderen,
anders dan die gevloekte geestelijkheid, die hoop ledige, vadsige
monniken? En dit alles om hunnen rijkdom te behouden, alsmede hunnen
invloed op de afgodendienaars, en door ondergang, bloed en vuur te
heerschen over het arme land. In de kooi, de wolven, die de menschen
beloeren; in de kooi, de hyena's. Vive le Geus!
--Soldatenwoord is gulden woord!
's Anderen daags, kwam een bode vanwege messire Lumey, met bevel de
negentien gevangen monniken te doen overbrengen van Gorkum naar den
Briel, alwaar de admiraal zich bevond.
--Zij zullen gehangen worden, zei kapitein Marinus tot Uilenspiegel.
--Toch niet zoolang ik zal leven, antwoordde hij.
--Mijn vriend, zeide Lamme, spreek zóó niet tot messire Lumey. Hij is
wreedaardig en zal u doen hangen in het weinig vereerend gezelschap
der monniken.
--Ik zal spreken naarvolgens de waarheid, antwoordde Uilenspiegel:
soldatenwoord is gulden woord!
--Als gij ze kunt redden, zeide Marinus, breng hunne boot naar den
Briel. Neem Rochus den loods mee, en uwen vriend Lamme, als gij wilt.
--Ik wil, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
De boot werd gemeerd aan de Groene Kade, de negentien monniken namen er
plaats in; de vreesachtige Rochus werd gezet aan het roer, Uilenspiegel
en Lamme, beiden goed gewapend, gingen staan op de voorplecht. Eenige
schavuiten, die met het oog op de plundering als soldaten bij de Geuzen
waren gekomen, zaten bij de monniken, die honger hadden. Uilenspiegel
gaf hun te eten en te drinken. "Die zal verraden!" zeiden de slechte
soldaten. De negentien monniken zaten in het midden, schijnheilig
vroom en bibberend, hoewel men in de Hooimaand was en de zon helder
en warm scheen, en een zachte zeewind de zeilen der boot deed zwellen,
die log en zwaar over de groene golven gleed.
Pater Nicolaas sprak toen en zeide tot den loods:
--Rochus, leidt men ons naar het Galgeveld?
Vervolgens wendde hij zich in de richting van Gorkum en sprak,
terwijl hij rechtstond en de hand uitstak:
--O, stede van Gorkum, o stede van Gorkum! Hoevele kwalen hebt gij
te lijden: gevloekt zult gij wezen onder al de steden, want binnen
uwe muren hebt gij het zaad der ketterij laten kiemen! O, stede van
Gorkum! En de engel des Heeren zal bij uwe poorten de wacht niet
meer houden. Hij zal niet meer zorgen voor de eer uwer maagden, den
moed uwer mannen, het fortuin uwer kooplieden! O stede van Gorkum,
gevloekt zijt gij, rampzalige!
--Gevloekt, gevloekt, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, gevloekt zeker als
de kam, die al de Spaansche luizen afgekamd heeft! Gevloekt als
de hond, die zijne keten verbreekt, als het trotsche peerd, dat
een wreedaardigen ruiter ontzadelt! Maar gij zelf zijt gevloekt,
dompelaar van een predikant, die slecht vindt dat men de roede,
al ware zij van ijzer, aan stukken slaat op den rug der tirannen!
De monnik zweeg en sloeg de oogen neer; hij scheen ganschelijk
overgeleverd aan zijn godvruchtigen haat.
De schavuiten, die met het oog op plundering als soldaten bij de
Geuzen waren gekomen, waren nabij de monniken, dewelke weldra weer
honger kregen. Uilenspiegel vroeg voor hen haring en beschuit. De
schipper van de boot antwoordde:
--Smijt ze in de Maas, daar zullen zij versche haring vinden.
Uilenspiegel gaf toen aan de monniken al het brood en al de worst,
die hij overhad voor zich en voor Lamme.
De schipper en de schavuiten zeiden tot elkander:
--Die is een verrader, hij spijst de monniken. Wij moeten hem
aanklagen.
Te Dordrecht hield de boot stil in de haven, aan de Bloemenkade;
mannen, vrouwlieden, knapen en meidekens kwamen in groote menigte
toeloopen om de monniken te zien en zeiden tot elkander, terwijl zij
hen met den vinger toonden of met de vuisten bedreigden:
--Beziet die schoften daar, die godmakers, die de lichamen naar de
brandstapels brengen en de zielen naar 't eeuwige vuur; beziet die
vetgemeste tijgeren, die dikbuikige jakhalzen.
De monniken lieten het hoofd zakken en dorsten niet spreken. Weer
zag Uilenspiegel hen zitten bibberen.
--Wij hebben nog honger, medelijdende soldaat, zeiden zij.
Maar de schipper sprak:
--Wie drinkt altijd? Droog zand. Wie eet altijd? Monniken.
Uilenspiegel ging hun in de stad brood, hesp en een grooten pot
bier koopen.
--Eet en drinkt, zeide hij; gij zijt onze gevangenen, doch als ik kan,
zal ik u redden. Soldatenwoord is gulden woord!
--Waarom geeft gij hun dat eten en drinken? Nooit zullen zij u betalen,
zeiden de schavuiten.
En stille spekend, fluisterden zij elkander in 't oor:
--Hij heeft beloofd hen te redden, wij moeten hem gadeslaan.
Met den dageraad kwamen zij aan den Briel. Toen de poorten hun geopend
waren, ging een voetlooper messire Lumey verwittigen van hunne komst.
Zoodra deze de miede ontving, sprong hij te peerd en, nauwelijks
gekleed en vergezelschapt door eenige gewapende ruiters en
voetknechten, kwam hij aan de boot.
En nog eens kon Uilenspiegel den wreeden admiraal zien, gekleed als
een heer, die in overvloed baadt.
--Goeden dag, heeren monniken, sprak hij. De handen op! Waar is het
bloed der heeren van Egmond en Hoorn? Gij toont mij uwe pootjes,
dat is wel van u....
Een monnik, Leonard genoemd, antwoordde:
--Doe met ons wat gij wilt. Wij zijn monniken, niemand zal ons
opeischen.
--Hij heeft goed gesproken, zeide Uilenspiegel; want vermits de
monnik afgebroken heeft met de wereld, dewelke vader en moeder,
broeder en zuster, gade en vriendin is, vindt hij op Gods uur
niemand, die hem opeischt. Nochtans, Excellentie, wil ik het doen:
Bij het teekenen van de overgave van Gorkum, bepaalde kapitein
Marinus dat die monniken vrij zouden wezen, gelijk al degenen,
die genomen werden in de citadel en die er uitkwamen. Zij werden er
echter zonder reden gevangen gehouden; ik hoor zeggen, dat zij zullen
gehangen worden. Heer, ootmoediglijk richt ik mij tot u, om hen voor
te spreken, want ik weet, dat soldatenwoord gulden woord is.
--Wie zijt gij? vroeg messire Lumey.
--Heer, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, ik ben Vlaming uit het schoone
Vlaanderenland, boer, edelman, alles te zamen, en door de wereld ga
ik aldus, om het goede en schoone te prijzen en volmondig te spotten
met alles wat dwaas en verkeerd is. En u zal ik prijzen, als gij de
belofte houdt, dewelke de kapitein heeft gesteld: Soldatenwoord is
gulden woord!
Maar de schavuiten, die met het oog op plundering bij de Geuzen waren
gekomen, zeiden:
--Heer, die is een verrader: hij heeft beloofd hen te redden; hij
heeft hun brood, hesp, worst en bier gegeven, en ons niets.
Messire Lumey zeide toen tot Uilenspiegel:
--Vlaming, die het goede prijst en monniken spijst, gij zult met
henzelven worden gehangen.
--Ik ben zonder vrees, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, soldatenwoord is
gulden woord!
--Daar hebt gij u iets moois op den hals gehaald, sprak Lamme.
--De assche klopt op mijn hert, zeide Uilenspiegel.
De monniken werden naar eene schuur gebracht, en Uilenspiegel met
hen; daar wilden zij hem bekeeren met godgeleerde bewijsvoeringen;
maar hij viel in slaap bij hunne reden.
Terwijl messire Lumey aan tafel zat, welke vol wijn en vol vleesch
stond, kwam een bode van Gorkum, vanwege kapitein Marinus, met het
afschrift van de brieven des Prinsen van Oranje, "lastende en bevelende
aan al de voogden van steden en andere plaatsen, de geestelijken in
gelijke veiligheid, zekerheid en privilege te houden als de andere
standen des volks".
De bode vroeg om bij Lumey toegelaten te worden, ten einde hem,
eigenhandig, het opschrift der brieven te geven.
--Waar is 't origineel? vroeg Lumey.
--Bij mijn meester Marinus, zeide de bode.
--En die boer zendt mij het afschrift! zeide Lumey. Waar is uw pas?
--Hier, heer, sprak de bode.
Messire Lumey las:
--"Mijnheer en meester Marinus Brand last al den ministers, stadhouders
en officieren der Vereenigde Provinciën, vrijelijk door te laten enz."
Lumey sloeg met de vuisten op de tafel en scheurde den brief aan
stukken; hij riep woedend uit:
--Verdoemd, waarmede bemoeit hij zich, die Marinus, die schooier,
die vóór de inneming van den Briel nog geene graat van een haring te
vreten had? Hij heet zich mijnheer en meester, en zendt bevelen aan
mij! Hij last en beveelt! Zeg aan uw meester, dat, mits hij zulk een
mijnheer en zulk een meester is, welk zoo goed lasten en bevelen kan,
de monniken op staanden voet zullen opgeknoopt worden, en gij daarbij,
als gij niet dadelijk opkraamt!
En met een schop onder de broek, smeet hij hem buiten de kamer.
--Drinken! riep hij. Hebt gij de verwatenheid van dien Marinus
gezien? Ik ben woedend! Dat men de monniken dadelijk opknoope in
hunne schuur, en dat men dien Vlaming voor mij brenge, nadat hij hun
halsrecht bijgewoond heeft. We zullen eens zien of hij mij zal durven
zeggen, dat ik slecht deed. Alle duivels! waarom zijn hier nog potten
en glazen van doen?
En met groot gerucht sloeg hij de bekers en het vaatwerk kapot, en
niemand durfde hem aanspreken. De knechten wilden de stukken oprapen,
maar hij liet het niet toe; onmatig ledigde hij de eene flesch na de
andere, en hij werd nog woedender, want hij liep met groote stappen
de kamer op en neer, razend de scherven onder de voeten vertrappend.
Uilenspiegel werd vóór hem gebracht.
--Hewel, zeide hij hem, brengt gij mij miede van uwe vrienden,
de monniken?
--Zij zijn gehangen, sprak Uilenspiegel, en een lafhertige beul,
door baatzucht gedreven, heeft een hunner, na zijnen dood,
den buik en de zijden geopend, om aan een apotheker het vet te
verkoopen. Soldatenwoord is geen gulden woord meer!
Lumey, voort de scherven vertrappend, bulderde:
--Gij trotseert mij, armzalige nietdeug, maar gij ook zult gehangen
worden, niet in eene schuur, maar schandelijk op de Markt, in het
aanschijn van elkeen.
--Schande over u, sprak Uilenspiegel, schande over ons: soldatenwoord
is geen gulden woord meer!
--Wilt gij zwijgen, ijzeren kop! riep messire Lumey.
--Schande over u, sprak Uilenspiegel, soldatenwoord is geen guldenwoord
meer! Straf liever de nietdeugen, verkoopers van menschenvet!
Messire Lumey vloog naar hem toe en hief de hand op om hem te slaan.
--Sla, sprak Uilenspiegel, ik ben uw gevangene, maar ik heb geen
schrik van u: Soldatenwoord is geen gulden woord meer!
Toen trok messire Lumey zijn degen en zeker had hij Uilenspiegel
gedood, zoo Treslong zijn arm niet weerhouden had, zeggende:
--Medelijden! hij is moedig en dapper, en heeft geenerlei misdaad
bedreven.
Lumey veranderde toen van gedachte en sprak:
--Dat hij vergiffenis vrage!
Maar Uilenspiegel bleef rechtstaan en sprak:
--Ik zal het niet doen.
--Dat hij ten minste zegge, dat ik geen ongelijk had, riep Lumey nog
blakend van woede.
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Ik lik de hielen der heeren niet: soldatenwoord is geen gulden
woord meer!
--Dat men de galge oprichte, sprak Lumey, en dat men hem wegbrenge,
dat zal woord van kemp voor hem wezen.
--Ja, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, en voor het vergaderde volk zal ik u
toeroepen: Soldatenwoord is geen gulden woord meer!
De galge werd opgericht op de Groote Markt. De mare liep weldra door
de stad, dat men Uilenspiegel ging hangen, den dapperen Geus. En het
gemeen was tot weenens toe bewogen. En in groote menigte snelde het
naar de Groote Markt; messire Lumey, te peerd, kwam er ook, daar hij
zelf het teeken van de terechtstelling wilde geven.
Wrokkig keek hij naar Uilenspiegel op de ladder, gekleed voor den
dood, in zijn hemd, de armen op zijn lichaam gebonden, de handen
samengevouwen, het strop om den hals, met den hangman naast zich,
welke gereed was om de straf te volbrengen.
Treslong zeide tot Lumey:
--Heer, schenk hem genade; hij is geen verrader, en nimmer zag men
een man hangen omdat hij openhertig en meewarig was.
Toen de mannen en vrouwlieden uit 't volk de woorden van Treslong
hoorden, riepen zij:
--Genade heer, genade, heb medelijden met Uilenspiegel.
--Die ijzeren kop heeft mij getrotseerd, sprak Lumey: dat hij berouw
hebbe en zegge, dat ik wel gedaan heb.
--Wilt gij berouw hebben en zeggen, dat hij wel gedaan heeft? vroeg
Treslong tot Uilenspiegel.
--Soldatenwoord is geen gulden woord meer, zeide Uilenspiegel.
--Steek het strop over zijnen hals, beval Lumey.
De hangman wilde gehoorzamen, doch een meideken, heel in 't wit
gekleed, met een kroontje op 't hoofd, beklom als waanzinnig de
trappen van het schavot, vloog Uilenspiegel om den hals en zeide:
--Die man is de mijne, ik neem hem tot echtgenoot!
En het volk juichte toe, en de vrouwlieden riepen:
--Leve, leve het meideken, dat Uilenspiegel redt van den dood!
--Wat beteekent die zotternij? vroeg messire Lumey.
Treslong antwoordde:
--Volgens de costumen en gebruiken van de stede, is het recht en wet,
dat een jonge dochter, maagd of ongehuwd, een man van de koord redt,
als zij hem aan den voet van de galge tot echtgenoot neemt.
--God is met hem, zeide Lumey; maak hem los!
Hij reed tot omtrent het schavot en zag het meideken druk bezig met
Uilenspiegel's koorden door te snijden, terwijl de beul het heur
wilde beletten, zeggende:
--Als gij ze doorsnijdt, wie zal ze betalen?
Maar het meideken luisterde niet.
Als hij heur zoo vlug en ijverig en liefdevol bezig zag, was hij
verteederd.
--Wie zijt gij? vroeg hij.
--Ik ben Nele, zijne bruid, zeide zij, en kom uit Vlaanderen om hem
te halen.
--Gij kwaamt in tijds, zeide Lumey op barschen toon.
En hij toog henen.
Treslong naderde toen en sprak:
--Brave Vlaming, wilt gij op onze schepen nog dienen, als gij
getrouwd zijt?
--Ja, messire, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
--En gij, meideken, wat zult gij doen zonder uwen man?
Nele antwoordde:
--Als gij wel wilt, messire, zal ik bij hem blijven op zijn schip en
op de pijp spelen.
--Zeker, wil ik, antwoordde Treslong.
En hij gaf heur twee gulden voor de bruiloft.
En Lamme, die weende en lachte van blijdschap, zei:
--Hier zijn nog drie gulden: wij zullen lekker gastreeren; ik
trakteer. Komt, we gaan naar den Gouden Kam. Hij is niet dood, mijn
vriend! Vive le Geus!
En het volk juichte toe, en zij trokken naar den Gouden Kam, alwaar
een groot feestmaal besteld werd, en Lamme smeet, door het venster,
oortjes te grabbel naar 't volk.
En Uilenspiegel zeide tot Nele:
--Liefste, nu zijt ge bij mij. Hoezee! zij is hier, in levenden
lijve, met hart en met ziel, mijn zoete vriendin. Ho! die zachte
oogen en die schoone roode lippen, over dewelke nooit anders dan
goede woorden kwamen! Zij redde mij 't leven, de welbeminde! Op onze
schepen zult gij de pijp der verlossing bespelen. Herinnert gij u nog
... doch neen.... Voor ons is thans blijdschap en vreugde, voor mij
uw gezichtje, dat zoet is als de bloemen in de Zomermaand. Ik ben in
het hemelrijk! Maar, zeide hij, gij weent....
--Zij hebben heur gedood, zeide zij.
En zij vertelde hem de rouwvolle mare.
En zij staarden elkander aan, en weenden van minne en van smerte.
En op het festijn aten en dronken zij, en Lamme keek hen jammerlijk
aan.
--Laas, zuchtte hij, waar zijt gij, mijne vrouw?
En de priester kwam en trouwde Nele en Uilenspiegel.
En de morgenzon vond hen bij elkander in 't huwelijksbed.
En Nele rustte met heur hoofdje op den schouder van Uilenspiegel. En
als zij ontwaakte in de zonne, zeide hij:
--Frisch gezichtje en zoet hertje, wij zullen de wrekers van Vlaanderen
wezen!
Zij kuste hem op den mond en zeide:
--Dolle kop en sterke arm, God zegene de pijp en het zweerd!
--Ik zal u een soldatendos maken.
--Dadelijk? vroeg zij.
--Dadelijk, antwoordde Uilenspiegel; maar wie dan zegt, dat aardbeziën
lekker zijn, 's morgens? Uw mond is veel zoeter!
IX.
Evenals hunne vrienden en gezellen, hadden Uilenspiegel, Lamme en
Nele, den kloosters het goed teruggenomen, dat deze vergaard hadden,
door middel van begankenissen, valsche mirakelen en andere Roomsche
mommerijen, ten koste van 't onnoozele volk. Dit was in strijd met
de bevelen van den Zwijger, den prins van de vrijheid, maar het
geld diende voor de kosten des oorlogs. Lamme Goedzak vergenoegde
zich niet met het geld, doch hij roofde nog in de kloosters hespen,
worsten, bottels bier, flesschen wijn; niet zelden kwam hij terug met
eene weitasch vol gevogelte, kalkoenen, ganzen, kapoenen en kiekens
op den buik en met eenige monnikenverkens en kloosterkalveren achter
zich aan een touw. En dit krachtens het oorlogsrecht, naar hij zeide.
Vol blijdschap bij elke verovering, bracht hij zijn buit naar het
vaartuig om er lekker mee te smullen; maar hij deed bitter zijn
beklag, dat de kok zoo weinig ervaren was in de edele konsten van
koken en braden.
Nu, dien dag hadden de Geuzen een lekker glaasje op de zege gedronken,
en ze zeiden tot Uilenspiegel:
--Gij staat steeds met den neus in den wind, om tijdingen van het
vasteland te vernemen; gij kent al de krijgsavonturen: zing ze ons
eens. Maar Lamme moet op de trom slaan en de bevallige pijpster zal
naar de maat van het lied spelen.
En Uilenspiegel zeide:
--Op een frisschen, helderen Meimorgen, vond Lodewijk van Nassau
dewelke Bergen meende binnen te rukken, zijne voetknechten en zijne
ruiters niet meer. Eenige vertrouwden hielden eene poort geopend
en eene brug was neergelaten, opdat hij de stede kon nemen. Maar
de poorters bemachtigden de brug en de poort. Waar zijn de soldaten
van graaf Lodewijk? De poorters gaan de brug ophalen. Graaf Lodewijk
blaast op den horen.
En Uilenspiegel zong:
    Waar zijn uw voetgangers? Waar uw ruiters?
    Verdwaald in het bosch, alles vertredend,
    Dorre twijgjes en bloeiende klokjes.
    Vrouw Zon doet blinken
    Roode strijdlustige wezens
    En glansende manen van rossen.
    Graaf Lodewijk steekt den hoorn.
    Ze hooren 't. Slaat zacht de trom.
    In gestrekte vaart, met schuimend gebit,
    Bliksemren, wolkenren,
    Een hoos van kletterend staal!
    Zij vliegen, de zware ruiters!
    Spoed, spoed! Ter hulp!
    De brug gaat op.... De spoor
    In den bloedenden buik der paarden.
    De brug gaat op: verloren stad.
    Er vóór reeds. Is het te laat?
    Te vierklauw, met schuimend gebit!
    Chaumont, op zijn gelen vos,
    Springt op de brug die terugvalt.
    Gewonnen stad! Hoort gij
    Op Bergens plaveien,
    Bliksemren, wolkenren,
    Een hoos van kletterend staal?
    Leve Chaumont en de gele vos!
    Klaroent uw vreugd uit, slaat op de trom;
    Hooimaand is 't, de weiden geuren.
    De leeuwerik stijgt, tiereliert in de lucht:
    Leve de vrije vogel!
    Slaat op de trom der glorie.
    Leve Chaumont en de vos!
    Alhier, te drinken!
    Gewonnen stad. Leve de Geus!
En de Geuzen zongen op de schepen:
Christus, zie uwe soldaten. Zegen onze wapenen, Heer. Leve de Geus.
En Nele met heur lachend gezichtje speelde op de pijp, en Lamme
sloeg op de trom, en naar omhoog, naar den hemel, den tempel Gods,
verhieven zich gouden kelken en lofzangen van vrijheid. En de baren,
helder en frisch, suisden welluidend rondom het schip als meerminnen,
X.
Eens, in de Oogstmaand, op een zwaren en warmen dag, was Lamme
droefgeestig. Zijn blijde trom zweeg en sliep stil, de stokken
staken weemoedig uit de opening zijner tassche. Uilenspiegel en
Nele, glimlachend van blijde minne, koesterden zich in de zonne; de
matrozen op kijkuit in de marsen, floten of zongen, en tuurden naar
de wijde zee, om te weten of zij geene prooi aan den gezichteinder
zagen. Treslong ondervroeg hen, en steeds antwoordden zij: Niets!
En Lamme, bleek en afgemat, zuchtte jammerlijk. En Nele zei hem:
--Hoe komt het, Lamme, dat gij zoo treurig gestemd zijt?
En Uilenspiegel zei hem:
--Gij wordt mager, mijn jongen.
--ja, zeide Lamme, ik ben treurig en mager. Mijn hert verliest zijne
vroolijkheid, en mijn goede tronie heure frischheid. Ja, lacht maar met
mij, gijlie, die, na duizenden gevaren, elkander terugvondt. Spot maar
met den armen Lamme, die, getrouwd zijnde, leeft als een weduwnaar,
terwijl deze hier--zeide hij, naar Nele wijzend--heuren man moest
ontrukken aan de kussen der koorde, welke toch zijne laatste
minnaresse zal wezen. Zij deed wel, God zij geloofd; maar dat ze
niet lache met mij. Ja, Nele, mijne vriendin, gij moet met den armen
Lamme niet spotten. Mijne vrouw lacht voor tien, laas! gijlie vrouwen
zijt ongevoelig voor eens andermans leed. Ja, mijn hert is treurig,
het is getroffen door het zweerd der verlatenheid; en niets zal het
kunnen versterken, dan zij.
--Of een lekkere stoverije, zeide Uilenspiegel.
--Ja, zeide Lamme, waar is het vleesch hier op dit treurig schip? Op
de bodems des konings hebben zij viermaal vleesch in de week--als er
geene vasten in valt--en driemaal visch. Wat aangaat de visch, ik mag
verdoemd zijn als die bloedlooze vezelen iets anders doen dan nutteloos
mijn arm bloed ontsteken, dat binnenkort in water zal vergaan. De
Spanjolen hebben bier, kaas, soep en goede dranken. Ja, om hunne
magen te streelen, hebben zij alles: beschuit, peperkoek, bier, boter,
gerookt vleesch; ja alles: gedroogde visch, kaas, mosterdzaad, zout,
boonen, erwten, gort, azijn, olie, vet, hout en kolen. Ons komt men
verbieden het beestiaal te nemen van wie hoegenaamd, 't zij poorter,
abt of edelman. Wij eten haring en drinken kort bier. Laas! niets heb
ik nog: noch liefde der vrouw, noch goeden wijn, noch dobbel bruinbier,
noch lekkere spijzen. Waar is hier onze vreugde?
--Ik ga het u zeggen, Lamme, antwoordde Uilenspiegel. Oog om oog, tand
om tand: te Parijs hebben ze, in den Bartholomeusnacht, tienduizend
vrije herten gedood in de stad alleen; de koning zelf schoot naar zijn
volk! Ontwaak, Vlaming, grijp naar de bijl, zonder genade! Dáár ligt
onze vreugde. Tref de vijanden, 't zij Roomschen of Spanjaards, overal
waar gij ze vindt. Denk thans niet aan uwen buik. De slachtofferen,
doode en levende, allen ondereen, werden gebracht naar den stroom
en met gansche karrevrachten in 't water gestort. Hoort gij, Lamme,
dooden en levenden, allen ondereen? Negen dagen lang was de Seine rood
van het bloed, en de raven vielen bij zwermen op de stad neder. Te
La Charité, te Rouaan, Toulouse, Lyon, Bordeaux, Bourges, Meaux was
de slachting afgrijselijk. Ziet gij die benden volgekropte honden
liggen omtrent de lijken? Hunne tanden zijn moede. De vlucht van de
raven is log, zoodanig is heure maag overlast met het vleesch van de
slachtofferen. Hoort gij, Lamme, de stemme der zielen, die dorsten
naar wraak? Ontwaak, Vlaming. Gij spreekt van uwe vrouw. Ik geloof
niet dat ze ontrouw is, maar enkel waanzinnig, en zij bemint u nog
steeds, arme vriend: zij bevond zich niet te midden dier hofdamen,
dier wulpsche vampieren, welke, den nacht zelven der slachting, met
heur fijne handjes de lijken ontblootten. En zij lachten van genot,
die adellijke hoeren! Verheug u, mijn vriend, niettegenstaande uwe
visch en uw kort bier. Is de nasmaak van haring wat flauw, flauwer nog
is de reuk van die laagheid! Zij, die gemoord hebben, gastreeren nu;
en met hunne handen, waar nog bloed aan kleeft, ziet men ze vette
ganzen voorsnijden, om de vleugels, de billen en de stuit te bieden
aan schoone freules van Parijs. Zoo even tastten die jonkvrouwen naar
ander vleesch, naar koud vleesch!
--Ik zal nimmermeer klagen, zeide Lamme rechtstaande: haring is zalm,
kort bier is malvezij voor vrije herten! Vive le Geus!
En Uilenspiegel sprak:
    Leve de Geus! Niet weenen broeders.
    In puinen en bloed
    Bloeit de roos der vrijheid.
    Is God met ons, wie tegen?
    Zegeviert de hyena,
    Dra komt de leeuw.
    Met één klauwslag werpt hij haar, gescheurd, ten gronde.
    Oog voor oog, tand voor tand. Leve de Geus.
En de Geuzen op de schepen zongen:
    De hertog bescheert ons het eigenst lot.
    Oog voor oog, tand voor tand,
    Wond voor wond. Leve de Geus!
XI.
Het was een stikdonkere nacht; de storm loeide in de zwarte, sombere
wolken; Uilenspiegel stond met Nele op het dek van het schip en sprak
tot heur:
--Al onze vuren zijn uitgedoofd. Wij zijn vossen, die des nachts
azen op Spaansch wild, 't is te zeggen op hunne twee en twintig
bodemen, rijke schepen waarop lanteernen flikkeren, welke voor hen
ongelukssterren zijn. En wij, wij zullen ze overvallen.
Nele sprak:
--Deze nacht is een tooveraarsnacht. De hemel is zwart als de monding
der hel, de bliksemschichten flikkeren als de grimlach van Satan, de
verre storm bromt met een dof geloei, de meeuwen vliegen met schelle
kreten voorbij; de zee rolt heure lichtende golven als zilveren
slangen. Thijl, mijn geliefde, kom mee in de wereld der geesten! Neem
het tooverpoeder!
--Zal ik de Zeven zien, liefste?
En zij aten het tooverpoeder.
En Nele sloot Uilenspiegel's oogen, en Uilenspiegel sloot Nele's
oogen. En zij zagen een verschrikkelijk schouwspel.
Hemel, aarde en zee waren vol mannen, vrouwlieden, kinderen, die
wrochten, dobberden, liepen of droomden. De zee slingerde hen, de
aarde droeg hen. En zij krielden als palingen in eene ben.
Op tronen in 't midden van den hemel, zaten zeven mannen en
vrouwen, met een flikkerende ster op het voorhoofd; maar zij waren
zoo onduidelijk, dat Nele en Uilenspiegel alleen hunne sterren
onderscheiden konden.
De zee steeg omhoog tot den hemel en rolde in heur schuim de ontelbare
menigte schepen mede, welker masten en touwen tegen elkander stieten,
braken, verpletterden naar gelang van de onstuimige bewegingen der
golven. Toen verscheen een schip te midden van al de anderen. Zijne
buitenhuid was van vlammend ijzer. Zijne kiel was van staal,
scherp als een mes. Het water schreeuwde, zuchtte als zij het
doorkliefde. Grijnzend zat de Dood op de achterplecht van het schip,
met zijne zeis in eene hand en in de andere een zweep, met dewelke
hij de zeven personages sloeg. Een derzelven was een treurige,
magere, trotsche, stilzwijgende vrouw. In eene hand hield zij een
schepter en, in de andere, een zweerd. Naast haar zat eene vrouw met
vuurroode wangen schrijlings op eene geit; met heur bloote borsten,
heur halfgeopend kleed, heur wulpsche oogen, strekte zij zich ontuchtig
uit naast een oude jodin, die roestige nagelen opraapte, en een dikke,
opgezwollen vrouw, die nederviel telkens dat zij heur rechthielp,
terwijl een magere man beiden razend sloeg. Noch de dikke vrouw,
noch hare roodwangige gezellin sloegen weder. Midden onder hen zat
een monnik worsten te eten. Eene vrouw, die ten gronde lag, kroop als
eene slang tusschen de anderen. Zij beet de oude jodin ter oorzake
van hare nagelen, de opgeblazen vrouw omdat zij te veel genoegen had,
de roodwangige vrouw ter oorzake van den vochtigen glans heurer oogen,
den monnik om zijne worsten, en de magere vrouw ter oorzake van haren
schepter. En allen vochten weldra met elkander.
Toen zij voorbijvoeren, was het gevecht verschrikkelijk op de zee,
in den hemel en op de aarde. Het regende bloed. De schepen werden
geslecht met bijlen, met bussen, met kanonnen. De stukken vlogen in
de lucht, te midden van den rook van het kruit. Op de aarde stieten
de heiren tegen elkander als muren van staal. Steden, dorpen, oogsten
brandden onder kreten en tranen; hooge torens, als kantwerk van steen,
wierpen hunne schaduwen op het midden van 't vuur en vielen neder,
als gevelde eiken, met een vreeselijk gekraak. Eene menigte zwarte
ruiters, dicht bijeengedrongen als benden mieren, met het zweerd in
de hand, de pistool in de vuist, sloegen de mannen, de vrouwlieden
en kinderen. Eenigen kapten bijten in 't ijs en smeten de grijsaards
levend onder de schotsen; anderen sneden de borsten der vrouwen af en
strooiden peper in de gapende wonden; anderen nog hingen de kinderen
in de schoorsteenen op. Zij, die moede van slaan waren, verkrachtten
een meideken of eene vrouw, dronken, dobbelden, en roerden stapels
goudstukken--vrucht van de plundering--met hunne handen, waaraan nog
bloed kleefde.
De met sterren gekroonde zeven riepen: "Genade voor de arme wereld!"
En de spoken grijnsden. En hunne stemmen geleken op die van duizenden
nachtuilen, die te gelijk krassen. En de Dood zwaaide met zijne zeis.
--Hoort gij ze? sprak Uilenspiegel; zij zijn de roofvogelen der
arme menschen. Zij leven van de kleine vogelen, die de goeden en
eenvoudigen zijn.
En de met sterren gekroonde Zeven riepen: "Liefde, gerechtigheid,
goedertierenheid!"
En de zeven spoken grijnsden. En hunne stemmen geleken op die van
duizenden nachtuilen, die te gelijk krassen. En de Dood sloeg hen
met zijne zweep.
En het schip vaarde op den vloed en sneed alles in twee: booten,
vaartuigen, mannen, vrouwlieden, kinderen. Op de zee weergalmde het
gejammer der slachtofferen, die riepen: "Genade!"
En het roode schip ging over hen allen heen, terwijl de grijnzende
spoken krasten als nachtuilen.
En de Dood dronk dit water, hetwelk rood zag. van bloed.
En toen het schip in de nevelen verdwenen was, hield het gevecht op
en verzwonden de met sterren gekroonde Zeven.
En Uilenspiegel en Nele zagen anders niets meer dan den pikzwarten
hemel, de holle, bruisende zee, de donkere wolken, die voortgejaagd
werden boven het lichtende water en, dichter bij, bleekroode sterren.
Het waren de lanteernen van de twee en twintig bodemen der vloot. De
zee en de donder lieten een dof gerol hooren.
En Uilenspiegel trok zachtjes aan de wacharmklok en riep:--De
Spaanjaard! De Spanjaard! Hij stevent op Vlissingen!
En de kreet werd herhaald door geheel de Geuzenvloot.
En Uilenspiegel zeide tot Nele:
--Een grijze tint kleurt de zee en den hemel. De lanteernen flikkeren
nog slechts zwak; de ochtendschemering breekt aan, de wind wordt
frisscher, de baren werpen heur schuim over 't dek van de schepen, een
felle regen valt, doch eindigt weldra, de zon verrijst in volle gloor
en verguldt de toppen der golven: dat is uw glimlach, Nele, frisch als
het krieken van den morgen, zacht als de straal van de rijzende zon.
De twee en twintig bodemen varen voorbij; op de schepen der Geuzen
hoort men trommels en pijpen; Lumey roept: "In name des Prinsen,
op jacht!" Ewoud Pietersen Worst, schout-bij-nacht, roept: "In name
van Zijne Hoogheid, den Prins van Oranje en messire den admiraal, op
jacht!" Op al de schepen: op de Johanna, den Zwaan, de Anne-Mie den
Geus, het  Eedverbond, den Egmond, den Hoorn, den Willem de Zwijger,
roepen al de kapiteins: "In name van Zijne Hoogheid, den Prins van
Oranje en messire den admiraal, op jacht!"
--Op jacht! Vive Le Geus! roepen de soldaten en de matrozen.
De hulk van Treslong, op dewelke Uilenspiegel diende, en den-Briel
genaamd, van dichtbij gevolgd door de Johanna, den Zwaan en den
Geus, bemachtigt vier Spaansche bodemen. De Geuzen werpen al wat
Spaansch is in 't water, nemen de Nederlanders gevangen, ledigen
de vaartuigen als eierdoppen en laten ze, zonder masten of zeilen,
dobberen in de reede. Daarna achtervolgen zij de achttien andere
bodemen. De wind waait geweldig uit het gat van Antwerpen, de muur
der snelle vaartuigen buigt in het water van den stroom, onder 't
gewicht van de zeilen, die gezwollen staan als de kaken eens monniks
bij den wind die waait uit de keuken; de Spaansche bodemen varen snel;
de Geuzen achtervolgen ze tot in de reede van Middelburg, onder het
vuur van de forten. Daar ontstaat een bloedig gevecht; de Geuzen,
met hun enterbijlen in de hand, springen op het dek van de schepen,
welke weldra vol liggen met afgekapte armen en beenen, die men, na het
gevecht, bij manden in den vloed werpen moet. De forten schieten naar
hen; zij lachen er mee, en onder den kreet van: "Vive le Geus", nemen
zij in de Spaansche bodemen, kruit, kanonnen, kogels en koren. Als
de vaartuigen geledigd zijn, verbranden zij die; dan varen zij naar
Vlissingen, en laten ze walmen en uitbranden in de reede.
Van daar zullen zij mannen zenden, die Zeelands en Hollands dijken
zullen doorsteken, nieuwe schepen zullen helpen maken, en namelijk de
vliebooten van honderd veertig ton, die tot twintig gegoten ijzeren
stukken voeren.
XII.
Het sneeuwt op de schepen. Heinde en ver is de lucht wit, en zonder
ophouden valt de sneeuw immer door in het zwarte water, in hetwelk
zij smelt.
Het sneeuwt op het land: wit zijn de wegen, ook wit de flauwe schimmen
der ontbladerde boomen. Geenerlei gerucht is te hooren, tenzij het
verre gelui van Haarlems klokken, die het uur slaan, en van den
blijden beiaard, die in de dikke lucht zijn gesmoorde tonen zendt.
Luidt niet, klokken; speel uw zachte, eenvoudige deuntjes niet,
beiaard: don Frederik nadert, de zoon van den bloedigen hertog. Hij
komt op u af, gevolgd van vijf en dertig vendels Spanjaarden, uwe
doodvijanden, Haarlem, o stede van vrijheid; twee en twintig vendels
Walen, achttien vendels Duitschers, achthonderd peerden, een machtig
geschut volgen hem. Hoort gij op de wagens het geknars van het doodend
ijzer? Falkonetten, slangen, donderbussen met wijden mond, dat alles
is voor u, Haarlem. Luidt niet, klokken; werp uw blijde tonen niet
meer in de met sneeuw bezwangerde lucht, lustige beiaard.
--Wij, klokken, zullen luiden; ik, beiaard, ik zal zingen en mijn
stoute tonen werpen in de met sneeuw bezwangerde lucht. Haarlem is de
stad van de dappere harten, de kloekmoedige vrouwen. Van de hoogte
heurer torens ziet zij, zonder vrees, de zwarte drommen der beulen,
als helsche mieren naderen, met golvende bewegingen: Uilenspiegel,
Lamme en honderd Watergeuzen zijn binnen heure muren. Hunne vloot
kruist op het meer.
--Laat ze komen! zeggen de inwoners; wij zijn maar poorters, visschers,
zeelieden en vrouwen. De zoon van den hertog van Alva wil, naar hij
zegt, om onze stede binnen te komen, geen andere sleutels dan zijne
donderbus. Dat hij, als hij kan, die zwakke poorten opene: daarachter
zal hij mannen vinden. Luidt, klokken; werp uw blijde tonen in de
met sneeuw bezwangerde lucht, beiaard!
... Wij hebben slechts zwakke muren en onze grachten zijn gemaakt naar
de oude wijs. Veertien donderbussen braken hare zes en veertigponders
naar de Kruispoort. Stelt mannen daar, waar steenen ontbreken. De
nacht komt, een ieder werkt, 't is alsof het kanon zich hier nimmer
hooren liet. Naar de Kruispoort hebben zij zeshonderd tachtig bommen
geschoten; naar Sint-Janspoort, zeshonderd vijf en zeventig. Die
sleutels openen niet, want ziet, daarachter verheft zich een nieuw
bolwerk. Luidt, klokken; werp, beiaard, uw blijde tonen in de
bezwangerde lucht!
... Het kanon beschiet, beschiet altoos de muren, steenen springen er
af, muurvlakken storten neer. De bres is breed genoeg om eene compagnie
in front door te laten. Zij schreeuwen: "Bestorming! doodt! doodt!" Zij
wagen de beklimming, zij zijn met tienduizend; laat ze komen over
de grachten met hunne bruggen. Onze kanonnen staan gereed. Daar is
de kudde, die moet sterven. Groet hen, kanonnen der vrijheid! Zij
groeten: de kettingkogels, de stormhoepels, de brandende pikkransen
vliegen en fluiten, boren en kappen in het gros der belegeraars, die
nederzijgen of in wanorde vluchten. Vijftienhonderd dooden vervullen
de grachten. Luidt, klokken, en gij, beiaard, werp uw blijde tonen
in de bezwangerde lucht!
... Komt terug ter bestorming! Zij durven niet. Zij beginnen opnieuw
te schieten en te mineeren. Wij ook, wij kennen de kunst van de
mijn. Steekt, steekt de wiek aan onder henzelven; loopt, wij krijgen
een prachtig vuurwerk te zien. Vierhonderd Spanjolen vliegen in de
lucht! Dat is de weg niet naar de eeuwige vlammen. O, wat blijde
dans bij het zilveren geluid onzer klokken, bij de lustige muziek
van den beiaard!
... Ze weten dus niet, dat de prins waakt over ons, dat ons, alle
dagen, langs goedbewaakte wegen, sledevrachten koren en buskruit
geworden; koren voor ons, buskruit voor hen. Waar zijn hunne zeshonderd
Duitschers, die wij doodden en verdronken in 't Haarlemmermeer? Waar
zijn de elf vendels, die wij hun namen, de zes donderbussen en de
vijftig ossen? Wij hadden één ringmuur, nu hebben wij er twee. De
vrouwen zelven vechten mede, en Kenau Hasselaar voert heure dappere
zusteren aan. Komt, beulen, komt in onze straten, de kinderen zullen
u de knieën doorsnijden met hunne mesjes. Luidt, klokken, en gij,
beiaard, werp uw blijde tonen in de bezwangerde lucht!
... Maar het geluk is met ons niet. De vloot van de Geuzen wordt
verslagen op het meer. Zij zijn verslagen, de troepen, die de Prins van
Oranje ons zond. Het vriest, het vriest bitter. Geene hulp meer! Sedert
vijf maanden, wederstaan wij met duizend man tegen tienmaal zooveel. Nu
moeten wij met de beulen onderhandelen. Maar zal hij van onderhandeling
willen hooren, die bloedige hertog, die onzen val heeft gezworen? Laat
ons een uitval wagen met al onze soldaten: misschien banen zij zich een
weg door de vijandelijke drommen. Maar de vrouwen staan aan de poorten,
uit vrees dat men heur alleen de stede late bewaken. Luidt niet meer,
klokken; werp uw blijde tonen in de lucht niet meer, beiaard.
... Nu zijn wij in de Zomermaand, het hooi riekt lekker, het koren
rijpt in de zonne, de vogelen zingen: vijf maanden lang hadden wij
honger; de stede is in rouw; wij zullen allen uit Haarlem trekken, de
busschutters aan 't hoofd om den weg te banen, de vrouwen, de kinderen
en de magistraat daarachter, gevolgd door het voetvolk, dat waakt op de
bres. Een brief, een brief van den zoon van den bloedigen hertog! Is
't de dood, dien hij ons meldt? neen, 't is het leven aan allen,
die zijn in de stede. O, onverbeide genade, o leugen wellicht! Zult
ge nog zingen, blijde beiaard? Zij komen de stede binnen....
Uilenspiegel, Lamme en Nele hadden den dos van de Duitsche soldaten
aangetrokken, die met hen, ten getale van zeshonderd, opgesloten
waren in het Augustijnerklooster.
--Vandaag zullen wij sterven, zei Uilenspiegel stille tot Lamme. En aan
zijne borst drukte hij het liefelijke lichaam van Nele, die huiverde
van schrik.
--Laas! mijne vrouw, nimmermeer zal ik ze zien, zeide Lamme.
Maar wellicht redden die kleederen van Duitsche soldaten ons 't leven?
Uilenspiegel schudde het hoofd om te bedieden, dat hij aan geene
genade geloofde.
--Ik hoor het gerucht van de plundering niet, zeide Lamme.
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Volgens de overeenkomst, hebben de poorters de plundering en
het leven afgekocht, mits de somme van tweehonderd veertigduizend
gulden. Binnen twaalf dagen moeten zij honderdduizend gulden in
klinkende munte betalen, en de rest drie maanden later. Aan de vrouwen
werd bevolen de wijk te nemen in de kerken. Zij gaan ongetwijfeld de
slachting beginnen. Hoort gij de galgen en schavotten optimmeren?
--Ha! wij zullen sterven! sprak Nele; ik heb honger.
--Ja, sprak Lamme stille tot Uilenspiegel, de zoon van den bloedigen
hertog heeft gezeid, dat wij, uitgehongerd zijnde, gedwee naar de
strafplaats zullen tiegen.
--Ik heb zoo'n honger! sprak Nele.
's Avonds kwamen soldaten, en zij deelden een brood voor zes man uit.
--Driehonderd soldaten werden gehangen op de Markt, zeiden zij. Weldra
is 't uwe beurt. Geuzen en galgen hooren immer bijeen.
Den volgenden avond, kwamen zij nog met een brood voor zes man.
--Vier hoogpoorters, zeiden zij, werden onthalsd. Tweehonderd acht
en veertig soldaten werden twee aan twee gebonden en in de zee
gesmeten. De krabben zullen vet zijn dees jaar. Gij hebt geen goede
tronie, gijlie, sedert den 7n van Hooimaand, dat gij hier zijt. Wat
zijn zij slokkers en dronkaards, die inwoners der Nederlanden! wij,
Spanjaarden, generen ons met eenige vijgen voor ons avondmaal.
--'t Is zeker daarom, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, dat gij overal bij
de poorters uw vier eetmalen met vleesch, gevogelte, vla, wijn en
confituur eischt; en melk om het lichaam van uwe muchachas te wasschen,
en wijn om de pooten uwer peerden te baden?
Den 18n van Hooimaand zeide Nele:
--Mijne voeten zijn nat; wat is dit?
--'t Is bloed, zeide Uilenspiegel.
's Avonds kwamen de soldaten opnieuw met hun brood voor zes man.
--Daar waar de koorde niet volstaat, doet het zweerd het werk, zeiden
zij. Drijhonderd soldaten en zeven en twintig poorters, die de stede
meenden te ontvluchten, wandelen nu in de helle, met hun hoofd onder
hunnen arm.
's Anderen daags stroomde het bloed opnieuw in het klooster; de
soldaten kwamen geen brood brengen, maar alleenlijk naar de gevangenen
kijken en zeggen:
--De vijfhonderd Walen, Engelschen en Schotten, die gisteren onthalsd
werden, hadden een betere tronie. Dezen hebben honger, gewis; doch
wie dan zou sterven van honger, ten ware de Geus?
En, inderdaad, allen bleek, mager ontdaan en bibberend van koorts,
stonden zij daar lijk spoken.
Den 16n van Oogstmaand, om vijf uren's avonds, kwamen de soldaten
lachend binnen en zij gaven hun brood, kaas en bier. Lamme sprak:
--Dit is ons doodmaal.
Te tien uren kwamen vier vendrigs; de hoplieden deden de poorten van
vier kloosters openen en bevalen den gevangenen gevieren achter de
pijpen en trommels te gaan, tot aan de plaats, waar men hen zou doen
stilstaan. Sommige straten waren rood van 't bloed; en zij stapten naar
't Galgeveld.
Hier en daar waren de weiden bemorst met plassen bloed; overal was er
bloed op de muren gespat. De raven kwamen bij zwermen van alle kanten;
de zonne verborg zich in een bed van dampen, de hemel was nog helder,
en in het diepste deszelven ontwaakten schuchter de sterren. Eensklaps
hoorden zij een hertverscheurend gehuil.
De soldaten zeiden:
--Die daar schreeuwen, zijn de Geuzen van het fort Fuike, buiten de
stad; men laat ze sterven van honger.
--Wij ook, zeide Nele, wij gaan sterven.
En zij weende.
--De assche klopt op mijn hert, zeide Uilenspiegel.
--Ha! zeide Lamme in 't Vlaamsch,--de soldaten van het geleide
verstonden die mannelijke taal niet,--ha! zeide Lamme, had ik dien
bloedigen hertog onder handen en kon ik hem, tot zijne kroenge er van
berst, alle die koorden, galgen, pijnbanken, foltertuigen, gewichten
en Spaansche leerzen doen eten; kon ik hem doen drinken al het bloed,
dat door hem werd vergoten; kon ik, na duizenden folteringen, hem het
hert uit de borst rukken en hem dit rot en giftig ingewand rauw doen
eten! Dan zou hij voorzeker, van het leven naar den dood tiegend,
in de solferkolk vallen, alwaar de duivel het hem zonder ophouden
gelieve te doen eten en nog te doen eten. En aldus tot in de eeuwigheid
der eeuwigheden!
--Amen! zeiden Uilenspiegel en Nele.
--Maar ziet gij niets? vroeg zij.
--Neen, sprak Uilenspiegel.
--In 't Westen zie ik, zeide zij, zeven mannen en vrouwen in eenen
kring gezeten. Een der mannen is gekleed in het purper en draagt
een gouden kroon op het hoofd. Hij schijnt de hoofdman der anderen,
die allen in lompen en vodden gehuld zijn. In het Oosten zie ik een
andere groep van zeven komen: insgelijks aangevoerd door iemand, ook
gekleed in het purper, doch zonder kroon op het hoofd. En zij gaan
op tegen die van het Westen. En zij vechten tegen hen in de wolken;
maar nu zie ik niets meer.
--De Zeven, zei Uilenspiegel.
--Ik hoor, zeide Nele, omtrent ons in het loover, eene stem, zacht
als een ademtocht, neuren:
    Door den krijg en het vuur
    Door de lansen en zwaarden,
        Zoek;
    In den dood en het bloed
    In de puinen en tranen,
        Vind.
--Anderen dan wij zullen de verlossers van Vlaanderen wezen, antwoordde
Uilenspiegel. De nacht is zwart, en 'k zie de Spaansche huurlingen
fakkels aansteken. Wij zijn omtrent het Galgeveld. O, mijn zoete
vriendinne, waarom zijt gij niet ginder gebleven? Hoort gij niets
meer, Nele?
--'t Doet, zeide zij, een wapengekletter in het koren. En ziet gij,
op de gindsche heuvelen, aan het einde van den wegel, dien wij begaan,
den rooden gloed niet van fakkels, die flikkeren op het staal van
de wapenen? Ik zie de lichtjes van de wieken der bussen. Slapen
onze wachters of zijn zij met blindheid geslagen? Hoort gij dien
donderslag? Ziet gij de Spanjolen vallen onder de kogels? Hoort
gij: "Vive le Geus!" Met de piek vooruit, stormen zij den
wegel op. Langsheen de heuvelen dalen zij beneden met zwaaiende
bijlen.... Vive le Geus!
--Vive le Geus! riepen Lamme en Uilenspiegel.
--Daar, zei Nele, daar zijn soldaten, die ons wapenen langen. Neem aan,
Lamme, neem aan, mijn beminde. Vive le Geus!
--Vive le Geus! riepen al de gevangenen.
--De bussen houden niet op met schieten, zeide Nele, de Spanjolen
vallen als vliegen, verlicht als ze zijn door den gloed van de
toortsen. Vive le Geus!
--Vive le Geus! riepen de wakkere redders.
--Vive le Geus! riepen Uilenspiegel en de gevangenen. De Spanjolen
zijn omsloten in eenen kring van vuur. Slaat dood! Slaat dood! Geen
enkele ontsnappe! Slaat dood! geene genade, geen kwartier! En nu
trekken wij, met pak en zak, naar Enkhuizen. Wie heeft de zijden en
lakensche kleederen van onze beulen? Wie heeft hunne wapenen?
--Allen! Wij allen! riepen zij. Vive le Geus!
En, inderdaad, zij trokken naar Enkhuizen, alwaar zij de met hen
verloste Duitschers deden blijven, om de stede te bewaken.
En Lamme en Nele en Uilenspiegel keerden naar hunne schepen terug. En
weer zongen zij op de vrije zee: Vive le Geus!
En zij kruisten in de reede van Vlissingen.
XIII.
Daar was Lamme weder vroolijk gestemd. Hij kwam geerne aan land,
en joeg toen ossen, schapen en ganzen op, lijk anderen jacht maken
op hazen, herten en ortolanen.
En hij was niet alleen voor die voedzame jacht. Het deed deugd de
jagers te zien terugkomen met Lamme aan hunne spits: het hoornvee
trokken zij voort, terwijl zij het gewold en gevederd vee vóór zich
dreven en op de punt hunner gaffels kiekens, kapoenen en kalkoenen
droegen, niettegenstaande het verbod van den Prins.
En toen gastreerde men blijde op de schepen. En Lamme sprak:
--De geur der sausen stijgt tot in den hemel, alwaar hij de santen
verblijdt, die geerne ons maal kwamen deelen.
Terwijl zij in de reede kruisten, kwam eene koopvaardijvloot van
Lissabon, welker gezagvoerder niet wist, dat Vlissingen in de macht
der Geuzen gevallen was. Men beveelt hem het anker te werpen, de vloot
wordt omsingeld. Vive le Geus! Pijpen en trommen bevelen de entering;
de kooplieden hebben kanonnen en pieken, bijlen en bussen.
Bommen en kogelen regenen op de schepen der Geuzen. Hunne busschutters,
verborgen in de schans rondom den grooten mast, vellen, zonder gevaar
voor zich zelven, bij elk schot eenen man neer. De kooplieden vallen
als vliegen.
--Helpt mij, vrienden! zeide Uilenspiegel tot Lamme en Nele. Daar
zijn specerijen, juweelen, kostbaarheden, suiker, muskaatnoten,
kruidnagelen, gember, realen, dukaten, schoone, blinkende gouden
lammeren. Daar zijn meer dan vijfhonderd duizend geldstukken. De
Spanjool betaalt de kosten des oorlogs. Laat ons drinken! Zingen wij
de misse der Geuzen, dat is het gevecht!
En Uilenspiegel en Lamme liepen overal rond lijk leeuwen. Buiten het
bereik van de kogels, speelde Nele op de pijp, in de schans. Heel de
vloot werd genomen.
Als de dooden geteld werden, vond men er duizend langs de zijde der
Spanjaards, driehonderd langs den kant van de Geuzen; onder hen bevond
zich de kok van de vlieboot den Briel.
Uilenspiegel vroeg om voor Treslong en de matrozen te spreken, hetwelk
Treslong hem geerne toestond. En hij hield hun de volgende rede:
--Messire kapitein en gij, maats, wij hebben daar vele specerijen
geërfd, en Lamme, onze dikzak, hier tegenwoordig, vond steeds dat
de arme doode, die dáár ligt,--God hebbe zijne ziel,--niet ervaren
genoeg was in de konsten van zieden en braden. Zoo gij hem als
kok wildet aanstellen, zou hij u hemelsche stoverije en goddelijke
soezels bereiden.
--Wij willen, zeiden Treslong en de anderen; Lamme zal de kok van het
schip zijn. Hij zal den grooten pollepel voeren, om de scheepsjongens
van zijne sausen te jagen.
--Messire kapitein, gezellen en vrienden, sprak Lamme, ik ween van
geluk, want die groote onderscheiding verdien ik niet. Doch, vermits
gij u tot mijne onweerdigheid wilt richten, neem ik de edele bediening
aan van meester in de konsten van zieden en braden op de wakkere
vlieboot den Briel; doch ik bid u ootmoediglijk mij wel te willen
belasten met het opperbevelhebberschap over de keuken, zoodanig dat
uw kok--dat ben ik,--bij recht, wet ende macht, een iegelijk kunne
beletten eens andermans portie te komen eten.
Treslong en de anderen riepen:
--Leve Lamme! gij hebt recht, wet ende macht!
--Doch, zeide hij, nog een nederige bede moet ik u doen: ik ben vet,
groot en struisch, diep is mijn buik, diep mijne maag; mijn arme
vrouw--God geve ze mij weder--placht mij altijd twee portiën te geven,
in stede van eene: verleent mij dezelfde gunste.
Treslong, Uilenspiegel en de matrozen zeiden:
--Gij krijgt dobbel rantsoen, Lamme.
En Lamme, die plotseling weemoedig werd, zeide:
--Mijne vrouw, mijn liefste vriendin! als iets vermag mij over onze
scheiding te troosten, zal het, bij het uitoefenen mijner bediening,
het aandenken wezen aan uw goddelijke keuken in onze halle vol liefde.
--Gij moet den eed afleggen, mijn zoon, zei Uilenspiegel. Men brenge
den grooten pollepel en den grooten koperen ketel, op dewelken Lamme
moet zweren.
--Bij God, sprak Lamme, dewelke mij helpe, zweer ik getrouwheid aan
Zijn Hoogheid den Prins van Oranje, gezeid den Zwijger, dewelke in naam
des konings de provinciën Holland en Zeeland bestiert, getrouwheid aan
messire Lumey, admiraal-bevelhebber onzer edele vloot, en aan messire
Treslong, schout-bij-nacht en kapitein van het schip den Briel;
ik zweer, volgens de costumen en gebruiken der groote koks uit de
oudheid en naarvolgens de schoone boeken met platen, die zij over
de edele kookkunst nagelaten hebben, zoo goed als mij mogelijk is,
de vleezen, kiekens, ganzen, mitsgaders kalkoenen te bereiden, die
Fortuna ons zal zenden; ik zweer te zullen voeden: den gezegden messire
kapitein Treslong, zijn stuurman, wezende mijn vriend Uilenspiegel,
en u allen, bootsman, loods, schieman, maats, soldaten, kanonniers,
keldermeester, scheepsmaker, lijfjonker van den kapitein, chirurgijn,
hoornblazer, matrozen en wie ook genaamd. Is het gebraad te rauw,
heeft het gevogelte geen smakelijk uitzicht; verspreidt de soep een
flauwen geur, wat de voorbode is eener slechte spijsvertering; zet
de geur van de sausen u niet aan in de keuken te dringen, behoudens
mijn oorlof nochtans; maak ik u niet allen blijmoedig en wel te pas,
dan zal ik mijn edel ambt nederleggen, mij onbekwaam oordeelende
langer in de keuken te tronen. Zoo helpe mij God en zijne santen in
deze wereld en ook in de andere!
--Leve onze kok, riepen zij, de koning der keuken, de keizer der
stoverije. 's Zondags krijgt hij drij portiën in stede van twee!
En Lamme werd kok op den Briel. En terwijl zijn lekkere soep op het
vuur stond, ging hij fier, met den pollepel op den schouder, eene
handwijl aan de keukendeur staan.
En 's Zondags kreeg hij zijne drij portiën.
Als de Geuzen met den vijand handgemeen werden, bleef hij geerne
in zijne braderij; doch van tijd tot tijd klom hij naar boven, om
eenige malen zijne bus af te vuren, na hetwelk hij schielijk weer
naar beneden ging, om op zijne gerechten te passen.
Als een trouw kok en een dapper soldaat, werd hij hertelijk bemind
door een iegelijk.
Maar niemand mocht in zijne keuken komen. Want dan werd hij uiterst
grammoedig, en sloeg hij met zijnen pollepel gelijk de duivel op
Geeraard.
En wederom werd hij geheeten: Lamme de Leeuw.
XIV.
Bij zonneschijn, bij regen, bij sneeuw, bij hagel, 's winters en
's zomers, dobberen de schepen der Geuzen op het ruime sop.
Alle zeilen bijgezet, gelijk zwanen, blanke zwanen der vrijheid.
Wit voor de vrijheid, blauw voor de grootheid, oranje voor den Prins,
is de standaard der fiere bodems.
Alle zeilen bijgezet! alle zeilen bijgezet, varen de wakkere schepen;
de golven klotsen er tegen, de baren besproeien ze met schuim.
Zij varen, zij wiegen, zij vliegen op den stroom, de fiere schepen
der Geuzen, met de zeilen in 't water, snel als de wolken gejaagd
door den Noordenwind. Hoort gij hoe hun voorsteven klieft door de
baren? God der vrije mannen, vive le Geus!
Huiken, vliebooten, boeiers, poonen, vlug als de wind, die het orkaan
met zich voert: als de wolk, die den bliksem met zich draagt. Vive
le Geus!
Boeiers en poonen, platboomde vaartuigen glijden op den vloed. De
golven zuchten onder hunne kiel, als zij recht vóór zich stevenen, met
den moorddadigen muil hunner slang open op de voorplecht. Vive le Geus!
Alle zeilen bijgezet! alle zeilen bijgezet, varen de wakkere schepen;
de golven klotsen er tegen, de baren besproeien ze met schuim.
Bij dag en bij nacht, bij regen, bij hagel en sneeuw, varen zij
op de wateren. Christus lacht hen toe in de wolk, in de zon, in de
sterre. Vive le Geus!
XV.
De bloedige koning kreeg tijding van hunne zegepralen. De dood beloerde
dien beul, wiens lichaam opgevreten werd door de wormen. Door de gangen
van 't kasteel van Valladolid sleepte hij, ziekelijk en terugstootend,
zijn gezwollen voeten en zijn loodzware beenen. Nimmer neurde hij een
liedeken, de wreedaardige beul; als de Oosterkim kleurde, lachte hij
niet, en als de zonne zijn rijk verlichtte als met een glimlach des
Heeren, voelde hij geen de minste vreugd in zijn hert.
Maar Uilenspiegel, Lamme en Nele zongen als lijsters, waagden bestendig
hun leven; God schiep den dag en zij gingen er door, en zij vonden
meer genoegen in het uitdooven van eenen brandstapel, dan de zwarte
koning vreugde smaakte in het verbranden van gansch eene stad.
In dien tijd ook was Willem de Zwijger, Prins van Oranje, gedwongen
messire Lumey, graaf van der Marck, zijnen graad van admiraal te
ontnemen, uit oorzake van de ijselijke wreedheden, die hij bedreef. Hij
benoemde messire Bouwen Ewoutsen Worst in zijne plaats. Hij zag mede
naar middelen uit om den boeren het koren te betalen, dat de Geuzen
hadden genomen; om de gedwongen schattingen terug te geven, die
door dezen gelicht waren; om den Roomschen, gelijk een iegelijk, de
vrije beoefening van hunnen godsdienst te schenken, zonder vervolging
of nadeel.
XVI.
Op de schepen der Geuzen, onder den helderen hemel, op de schuimende
golven, weerklinken pijpen en doedelzakken, klokken de flesschen,
rinkelen de klinkaards, flikkeren de bussen der geweren.
--Nu, sprak Uilenspiegel, slaat op de trom van de zege, slaat de
trom van de vreugde! Vive le Geus! Spanje is verslagen, de vampier
is getemd. Aan ons de zee, Brielle is genomen! Aan ons heel de kust
van Nieuwpoort tot Helder, met Oostende, Blankenberge, de Zeeuwsche
eilanden, de monden der Schelde, de monden der Maas, de monden van
den Rijn! Aan ons Texel, Vlieland, Terschelling, Ameland, Rottum en
Borkum.... Vive le Geus!
... Aan ons Delft, Dordrecht! 't Is een loopend vuur. God houdt de
vuurlont. De beulen verlaten Rotterdam. Het vrije geweten, lijk een
leeuw met klauwen en tanden van gerechtigheid, neemt het graafschap
Zutfen, de steden Deutekom, Doesburg, Goor, Oldenzaal en, in de Veluwe,
Hattem, Elburg en Harderwijk.... Vive le Geus!
... 't Is klaar, 't is als de bliksem: Kampen, Zwolle, Hasselt,
Steenwijk vallen in onze handen met Oudewater, Gouda en Leiden.... Vive
le Geus!
... Aan ons Buren, Enkhuizen! Ja, Amsterdam, Schoonhoven, Middelburg
zijn nog in onze macht niet. Doch alles komt op tijd voor geduldige
klingen.... Vive le Geus!
... Laat ons Spaanschen wijn drinken! Laat ons drinken uit de
kelken, uit dewelke zij het bloed van de slachtoffers dronken: Wij
gaan langs de Zuiderzee, langs stroomen, rivieren en vaarten; wij
hebben Noord-Holland, Zuid-Holland en Zeeland; wij zullen ook Oost-
en West-Friesland nemen; Brielle zal de wijkplaaats wezen voor onze
vloot, de bakermat der vrijheid.... Vive le Geus!
... Hoor, Vlaanderen, geliefde vadergrond, hoor den kreet van wrake
weerklinken! Men slijpt de wapenen, men zet de zweerden aan op den
steen. Allen bewegen zich, trillen als de snaren eener harp bij den
warmen ademtocht, adem van de zielen, die stijgt uit de putten, uit
de brandstapels, uit de bloedige lijken der slachtofferen. Allen:
Henegouwen, Brabant, Luxemburg, Limburg, Namen, Luik, de vrije,
vurige stede, allen! Het bloed kiemt en rijst. De oogst is rijp voor
de zeis.... Vive le Geus!
... Aan ons de Noordzee, de wijde zee van het Noorden! Aan ons de
goede kanonnen, de slanke schepen, het stoutmoedige heir van de
dappere zeelieden: edelen, poorters en arbeiders, die de vervolging
ontvluchten. Aan ons, allen, die vereenigd opstaan voor het werk van
de vrijheid.... Vive le Geus!
... Waar zijt gij, Philippus, bloedige koning? Gedekt met den heiligen
hoed,--geschenk van den paus,--vloekt en tiert gij. Slaat op de trom
van vreugde!... Vive le Geus! Laat ons drinken!
... De wijn stroomt in de gouden kelken. Drinkt blijde een
heildronk. De priesterkleeren, dewelke die ruwe mannen bedekken,
zijn nat van het roode druivensap; de Roomsche banieren wapperen in
den wind. Eeuwige muziek! komaan, pijpen, doedelzakken, trommels,
zingt nu de lofzang der zege.... Vive le Geus!
XVII.
Toen was men in de Wintermaand, dat is de maand van de wolven. Een
scherpe regen viel als naalden in den vloed neder. De Geuzen kruisten
in de Zuiderzee. Bij trompetgeschal ontbood messire de admiraal op
zijn schip de gezagvoerders der hulken en vliebooten, en samen met
hen ook Uilenspiegel.
--Nu, zei de admiraal, eerst tot dezen sprekend, de Prins wil uw
goede en trouwe diensten erkennen en benoemt u tot gezagvoerder op
het vaartuig den Briel. Hier hebt gij uwe aanstelling op perkament.
--God zegene U, heer admiraal, antwoordde Uilenspiegel; ik zal zoo
goed gezag voeren als mij mogelijk is, en aldus gezag voerende, hoop
ik wel, met Gods hulp, Spanje het gezagvoerderschap te ontnemen over
Vlaanderen en Holland: ik wil zeggen over Zuid- en Noord-Nederland.
--Goed zoo, zei de admiraal. En nu, voegde hij er bij, tot al de
aanwezigen sprekend: moet ik u zeggen, dat die van het katholieke
Amsterdam van zins zijn Enkhuizen te belegeren. Zij zijn nog het IJ
niet uitgevaren: wij zullen kruisen vóór deze vaart, zoodat wij ze
sluiten, en elken bodem overvallen, die zijnen romp in de Zuiderzee
durft vertoonen.
Zij antwoordden:
--Wij zullen ze in den grond boren!... Vive le Geus!
Toen Uilenspiegel weder op zijn schip was gestegen, deed hij zijne
matrozen en soldaten vergaderen op het dek en deed hun kond van de
woorden des admiraals.
Zij antwoordden:
--Wij hebben vleugelen, dat zijn onze zeilen; schaatsen, dat zijn de
kielen onzer schepen; reuzenhanden, dat zijn onze enterhaken. Vive
le Geus!
De vloot vertrok en kruiste vóór Amsterdam, op eene mijl van het
strand, zoodanig dat geen schip kon binnen- of buitenvaren, als zij
het niet wilde.
Den vijfden dag hield het op met regenen; de wind woei scherper in
den helderen hemel; die van Amsterdam verroerden zich niet.
Eensklaps zag Uilenspiegel zijn vriend den kok op het dek stormen
en den scheepsjongen--een jongen snaak, ervaren in de Fransche en
in de Vlaamsche taal, maar nog meer in het smullen--achternazetten,
met zijn grooten houten pollepel in de hand.
--Nietdeug, zeide Lamme, duchtig met zijnen stoklepel slaande,
dacht gij dan, zonder eenige straf, voorbarig mijne stoverije op te
peuzelen? Klim hoog in den mast en zie of er nog geene beweging komt
op de schepen van Amsterdam; wilt ge wèldoen?
Maar de jongen antwoordde:
--Wat zult ge mij geven?
--Meent gij, dat ik u zal betalen vóór dat gij gewerkt
hebt? Dievengebroed, als gij niet omhoog klimt, laat ik u geeselen. En
uw Fransch zal u niet redden.
--'t Is een schoone tale, zeide de knaap, tale van minne en van oorlog.
En hij klom in den mast.
--Wel luiaard? vroeg Lamme.
De scheepsjongen antwoordde:
--Ik zie niets in de stad noch op de schepen.
En beneden gekomen, sprak hij:
--Betaal mij nu.
--Houd het gestolene voor uwe moeite, antwoordde Lamme; maar het zal
niet gedijen: voorzeker spuwt gij het uit.
De jongen, die weder in den mast was geklommen, riep eensklaps:
--Lamme! Lamme! daar sluipt een dief in uwe keuken!
--Daar is geen nood van, antwoordde Lamme, de sleutel steekt in
mijne tassche.
Toen nam Uilenspiegel zijnen vriend ter zijde en sprak:
--Lamme, die groote kalmte van Amsterdam verontrust mij. Zij voeren
iets in hun schild.
--Ik dacht er aan, zeide Lamme. Het water vervriest in de kruiken in de
schapraai; de kiekens zijn hard als hout; de worsten gansch berijmd;
de boter is als steen, de olie geklonterd, het zout droog als zand
in de zonne.
--Vorst is op handen, zeide Uilenspiegel. Zij zullen, in grooten
getale, ons komen beschieten met donderbussen.
Hij begaf zich naar het admiraalschip en zei daar wat hij vreesde;
de vlootvoogd antwoordde:
--De wind blaast uit Engeland: we krijgen sneeuw, maar geen vorst:
keer terug naar uw schip.
En Uilenspiegel ging henen.
's Nachts woedde een hevige sneeuwstorm; maar weldra blies de wind
uit Noorwegen, de zee vroor toe, zij was effen als een vloer. De
admiraal zag dit schouwspel.
In de vrees, dat die van Amsterdam de schepen in brand zouden steken,
beval hij den soldaten hunne schaatsen in gereedheid te houden,
voor het geval dat zij buiten en rondom de schepen moesten vechten,
en den kanonniers de kogels bij hoopen naast de affuiten te leggen,
de stukken te laden en de lonten gedurig in brand te houden.
Maar die van Amsterdam kwamen niet.
En aldus zeven dagen lang.
Tegen den avond van den zevenden dag beval Uilenspiegel, dat een goed
festijn gegeven werd aan de matrozen en soldaten, om hen te wapenen
tegen den scherpen wind, die woei uit het Noorden.
Maar Lamme zeide:
--Er blijft ons niets meer over dan beschuit en kort bier.
--Vive le Geus! zeiden zij. Dit zal ons een vastenfestijn zijn,
in afwachting van het uur van 't gevecht.
--Dat nog zoo gauw niet zal slaan, zeide Lamme. Die van Amsterdam
zullen komen om onze schepen te verbranden, maar dezen nacht nog
niet. Eerst zullen ze te hoop moeten komen rondom het vuur, en daar
menigen beker warmen wijn ledigen,--God verleene er u,--vervolgens,
als zij tot middernacht zullen beraadslaagd hebben met kalmte,
verstand en geduld, zullen zij beslissen morgen te besluiten of zij,
al dan niet, ons de toekomende week zouden aanvallen. Morgen zullen
zij, opnieuw onder het drinken van warmen wijn,--God verleene er
u,--opnieuw met kalmte, geduld en volle kannen beslissen dat zij een
anderen dag zullen vergaderen, ten einde uit te maken of het ijs, al
dan niet, een groote menigte kan dragen. En zij zullen het ijs doen
onderzoeken door deskundigen, dewelke hunne besluiten op perkament
zullen neerschrijven. Als zij die ontvangen en gelezen hebben, zullen
zij daarover verslag maken, waaruit zal blijken, dat het ijs een halve
el dik is, dat het sterk genoeg is om eenige honderden soldaten met
donderbussen en veldgeschut te dragen. Vervolgens opnieuw bijeenkomend,
om met kalmte en geduld, onder het drinken van menigen beker warmen
wijn te beraadslagen, zullen zij berekenen of het, om den wille van
den schat van Lissabon, dien wij hebben gekaapt, raadzaam is onze
schepen te bestormen of wel te verbranden. En, aldus besluiteloos,
maar dralend, zullen zij nochtans beslissen dat zij onze schepen
moeten nemen, en geenszins verbranden, niettegenstaande al het leed
en de schade, die zij ons daarmee zouden doen.
--Gij spreekt goed, antwoordde Uilenspiegel; maar ziet eens die
vuren aansteken in de stad en al die lieden haastig rondloopen met
lanteernen in de hand?
--'t Is van groote koude, zei Lamme.
En, zuchtend, voegde hij er bij:
--Alles is opgegeten. Geen ossevleesch, geen pekelvleesch, geen
gevogelte meer; geen wijn meer, laas! noch goed dobbel bier; niets
dan beschuit en kort bier. Wie komt er mee?
--Waar gaat gij? vroeg Uilenspiegel. Niemand mag het schip verlaten.
--Mijn vriend, zeide Lamme, thans zijt gij kapitein en
gezagvoerder. Zonder uwe toestemming zal ik het schip niet
verlaten. Doch gelief te bedenken, dat onze laatste worst er
eergisteren aan was; dat, in dezen harden tijd, keukenvuur de vreugd
van de goede maats is. Wie onzer is niet bereid den geur van goede saus
op te snuiven, of een lekker glaasje te drinken, hetwelk vroolijkheid
en goeden wil voor een ieder baart? Nu, kapitein en trouwe vriend,
ik durf het u zeggen: ik vreet mij het hert op, ik eet niet; ik, die
voor de rust ben, die niet geerne moord, tenzij een malsche gansch,
een vet kieken, een smakelijken kalkoen; ik volg u in de vermoeienissen
des oorlogs. Zie gindsche lichten, 't zijn die eener rijke hoeve,
goed voorzien van groot en klein vee. Weet gij wie daar woont? 't Is
die schipper van Friesland, die messire Dandelot verried en achttien
arme heeren en vrienden naar het nog Spaanschgezinde Enkhuizen
bracht, dewelke door zijn toedoen op de Peerdenmarkt--dat is de
Kleine Zavel--te Brussel, onthalsd werden. Die verrader, die Slosse
heet, ontving van den hertog twee duizend florijnen als prijs zijns
verraads. Met het geld van het bloed kocht hij, als een ware Judas,
de hoeve, die gij daar ziet, en zijn groot vee, en de velden in 't
ronde, dewelke gedijen en bloeien; ik zeg, dat hij schatrijk wordt
met zijnen grond en zijn vee.
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--De assche klopt op mijn hert. Het uur van God is geslagen.
--En ook het uur van het eten, zeide Lamme. Geef mij twintig wakkere
gasten, soldaten en matrozen, en ik breng u den verrader.
--Ik zelf wil hen aanvoeren, zeide Uilenspiegel. Wie voor de
rechtveerdigheid is, volge mij. Doch allen niet, mijne vrienden;
er zijn er maar twintig van doen; wie anders zou op het schip
letten? Laat de dobbelsteenen beslissen. Goed, nu zijt gij twintig,
komt mee. Riemt uwe schaatsen om en legt aan op Venus, de heldere
sterre, die flikkert boven de hoeve van den verrader.
... Komt dus, vrienden; rijdend en glijdend, met de akst op den
schouder, worden wij geleid door het glimmend licht van de heldere
maan.
... De wind fluit en jaagt witte sneeuwvlagen vóór zich op het
ijs. Komt, dappere mannen!
... Gij zingt noch gij spreekt; gij gaat, stilzwijgend, recht voor
u uit op de sterre; uwe schaatsen krassen op 't ijs.
... Wie valt, sta aanstonds weer op. Wij naderen den oever: geen
enkele menschelijke gedaante op de witte sneeuw, geen enkele vogel
vertoont zich in de ijskoude lucht. Doet uwe schaatsen af.
... Hier zijn wij op 't land, hier zijn wij in de weide, riemt uwe
schaatsen weer om. Wij zijn rondom de hoeve, houdt uwen adem in.
Uilenspiegel klopt op de deur, de honden bassen. Hij klopt nogmaals;
een venster wordt geopend en de boer, die het hoofd buitensteekt,
vraagt:
--Wie zijt gij?
Hij ziet niemand dan Uilenspiegel: de anderen zijn verborgen achter
de keet.
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Messire Bossu gelast u oogenblikkelijk bij hem, naar Amsterdam,
te komen.
--Waar is uwe vrijgeleide? vroeg de baas, toen hij beneden was en de
deur had geopend.
--Hier, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, hem de twintig Geuzen toonend,
die achter hem het huis binnenstormden.
Toen sprak Uilenspiegel tot hem:
--Gij zijt schipper Slosse, de verrader, die Dandelot, Battenburg
en andere heeren in eene hinderlaag loktet. Waar is de prijs van
het bloed?
Over al zijn ledematen bevend, antwoordde de hoevenaar:
--Gij zijt de Geuzen, schenkt mij vergiffenis; ik wist niet wat
ik deed. Ik heb hier geen geld in mijn huis; alles wat ik heb, zal
ik geven.
Lamme sprak:
--Het is donker, geef ons keersen.
De baas antwoordde:
--Dáár hangen vetkeersen.
Toen eene keers aangestoken was, zeide, in den heerd, een van de
Geuzen:
--Het is koud, laat ons vuur maken. Hier zijn schoone, dikke mutsaards.
En hij wees naar eene plank, op dewelke bloempotten stonden, waarvan
al de planten verdroogd waren. Hij nam er eene bij den kop en schudde
ze; de pot viel ten gronde, gevolgd door dukaten, realen, florijnen.
Daar is de schat, zeide hij, naar de andere bloempotten wijzend.
En, inderdaad, toen zij geledigd waren, vonden zij er tien duizend
florijnen.
Als de boer dat zag, begon hij te weenen en te huilen.
Op dat geroep kwamen de knechts en meiden der hoeve toegeloopen in
hun hemde. Daar de mannen hunnen meester wilden verdedigen, werden
zij gevat en gebonden. Maar de dienstmaagden waren beschaamd, en
vooral de jonge, en zij verborgen zich achter de mannen.
Lamme kwam toen vooruit, en hij sprak:
--Verrader, waar zijn de sleutels van den kelder, den stal en de
schaapskooi?
--Schaamtelooze diepers, zeide de baas, gij zult gehangen worden
totdat de dood er op volge!
Uilenspiegel antwoordde.
--Het is het uur van God, geef de sleutels!
Toen de Geuzen de hoeve geledigd hadden, reden zij op hunne schaatsen
terug naar de schepen, lichte hallen van vrijheid.
--Ik ben de kok, zeide Lamme hen leidend; ik ben de kok. Stoot de
wakkere sleden vooruit, beladen met wijn en met bier; drijft vóór u,
met zeelen of anderszins, ossen, varkens en schapen. De duiven kirren
in de kevies; de volgepropte kapoenen kijken beteuterd in de houten
kooien, in dewelke zij zich niet kunnen verroeren. Ik ben de kok. Het
ijs kraakt onder de schaatsijzers. Wij zijn nabij de schepen. Morgen
speelt er muziek in de keuken. Laat de katrollen beneden. Bindt de
banden om de koeien en ossen. 't Is een schoon schouwspel, ze aldus
bij den buik te zien hangen; morgen zullen wij hangen met de tong aan
hun vette stoverije. De katrol hijscht ze op tot boven het ruim. Het
zijn karbonaden. Smijt maar overhoop in het ruim, eenden, kapoenen,
ganzen en hoenders. Wie zal hun den nek omwringen? de kok. De deur
is gesloten, de sleutel steekt in mijne tassche. God zij geloofd in
de keuken! Vive le Geus!
Vervolgens begaf Uilenspiegel zich naar het admiraalschip, met Diederik
Slosse en de andere gevangenen, die zuchtten en weenden uit vrees
voor de koorde.
Messire Worst kwam bij het gerucht: hij bemerkte Uilenspiegel en
zijne gezellen, verlicht door den rooden gloed van de toortsen.
--Wat wilt gij? zeide hij.
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Dezen nacht namen wij, in zijne hoeve, Diederik Slosse, die de
achttien in een hinderlaag deed vallen. Hier is hij. De anderen zijn
onschuldige knechten en meiden.
Vervolgens langde hij hem een tassche, en hij sprak:
--Deze guldens groeiden in bloempotten in het huis des verraders:
er zijn er tienduizend.
Messire Worst zeide hun:
--Gij misdeedt de schepen te verlaten; doch gezien den goeden uitslag,
zal u vergiffenis worden geschonken. Welkom zijn de gevangenen en de
tassche vol guldens, en eere aan u, dappere lieden, aan dewelken ik,
volgens de rechten en costumen ter zee, het derde deel van den buit
schenk; het tweede deel zal zijn voor de vloot, en het andere derde
voor onzen hoofdman, den Prins van Oranje; knoopt den verrader op
staanden voet op.
De Geuzen gehoorzaamden; daarna kapten zij eene bijt in het ijs,
waarin zij het lijk smeten van Diederik Slosse.
Toen zeide messire Worst:
--Groeit er gras rond de schepen? Me dunkt, ik hoor hoenders kakelen,
schapen blaten en runderen loeien?
--Dat zijn de gevangenen voor onzen mond, antwoordde Uilenspiegel;
zij zullen hun rantsoen in stoverije betalen. Messire admiraal krijgt
het beste stuk van dezelve.
... Wat deze knechten en meiden betreft, onder dewelken zich
verscheidene lieftallige en poezele vrouwen bevinden, die ga ik weer
op mijn schip brengen.
Toen zulks gedaan was, hield hij hun de volgende rede:
--Mannen en vrouwen, gij zijt hier op het beste schip van de
wereld. Wij brengen er den tijd door met smullen; 't is een festijn
zonder einde. Als 't u belieft van hier weg te gaan, kunt gij het
doen, mits een rantsoen te betalen; verkiest gij te blijven, dan
zult gij leven lijk wij: dapper werken en flink eten. Wat die lieve
vrouwlieden betreft, ik geef haar bij gezagvoerderlijke macht de
volle vrijheid van lijf: 't is te zeggen, dat het mij heel eender
is of zij heure vrienden houden, die met haar op het schip kwamen,
of eene keuze doen onder onze dappere Geuzen, hier tegenwoordig,
om heur huwelijksch gezelschap te houden.
Maar al de lieftallige vrouwlieden bleven trouw aan heure vrienden,
uitgenomen een enkele, dewelke glimlachend keek naar Lamme en hem
vroeg of hij van heur wilde weten.
--God zegene u, liefste, zeide hij, maar ik ben reeds genomen.
--Hij is getrouwd, de dikzak, zeiden de Geuzen tot de spijtige schoone.
Maar zij keerde hen den rug toe en koos er een anderen, die, gelijk
Lamme, een goede tronie en een dikken buik had.
Dien dag en den volgenden gastreerde men aan boord van de schepen
met wijn, met vleesch en met gevogelte. En Uilenspiegel zeide:
--Vive le Geus! Blaas maar aan, scherpe Noordenwind, wij zullen de
lucht met onzen adem verwarmen. Ons hert is van vuur voor het vrije
geweten, van vuur onze maag voor het gebraad van den vijand. Laat
ons wijn drinken, dat is de melk van de dapperen. Vive le Geus!
Nele dronk ook uit een grooten gouden beker; zij bloosde van koude,
doch blijde bespeelde zij de pijp. En ondanks de koude, aten en
dronken de Geuzen juichend en vroolijk op het dek van de schepen.
XVIII.
Eensklaps zag heel de vloot op den oever zwarte drommen, onder
dewelke toortsen flikkerden en wapens glinsterden; vervolgens werden
de toortsen uitgedoofd, en heerschte volledigste duisternis.
De bevelen van den admiraal werden overgebracht, het sein tot
waakzaamheid gegeven, en alle de vuren uitgedoofd; matrozen en soldaten
gingen, met bijlen gewapend, op hun buik op het dek liggen. De wakkere
kanonniers, met hunne lont in de hand, waakten omtrent de donderbussen,
dewelke geladen waren met zakken kruit en met kettingkogels. Zoodra
de admiraal en de kapiteins zouden roepen: "Honderd passen!"--wat
de stelling van den vijand aanwees,--moesten zij vuren van voren,
van achterboeg of van boord, naarvolgens hunne stelling op het ijs.
En men hoorde de stem van messire Worst, dewelke sprak:
--Ter dood, hij die luide durft spreken!
En de kapiteins zeiden hem na:
--Ter dood, hij die luide durft spreken!
Het uitspansel was vol sterren, doch zonder maan.
--Hoort gij, zeide Uilenspiegel tot Lamme stil als de adem van
een spook. Hoort gij de stem van die van Amsterdam, en het ijzer
hunner schaatsen krassen op 't ijs? Zij rijden snel. Men hoort hen
spreken. Zij zeggen: "Die luie Geuzen liggen te slapen. Aan ons de
schat van Lissabon". Zij steken hunne toortsen weer aan. Ziet gij
hunne bestormingsladders en hunne leelijke tronies, en de breede
linie van hun aanvalsfront? Zij zijn duizend en meer.
--Honderd passen! riep messire Worst.
En men hoorde een geluid als van een donder, en een jammerlijk gehuil
op het ijs.
--Tachtig kanonnen bulderen tegelijk! zeide Uilenspiegel. Zij
vluchten! Ziet gij de toortsen verwijderen?
--Achtervolgt ze! zeide admiraal Worst.
--Achtervolgt! zeiden de kapiteins.
Maar de vervolging duurde niet lang, daar de vluchtelingen honderd
passen vóór waren en liepen als hazen.
En op de mannen, die kermden en reutelden op 't ijs, vond men goud,
kleinoodiën, en ook koorden om de Geuzen te binden.
En, na deze zegepraal, zeiden de Geuzen tot elkaar: "Als God met ons
is, wie zal tegen ons zijn?"
Nu, in den morgen van den derden dag, werd messire Worst ongerust,
want hij verwachtte een nieuwen aanval. Lamme sprong op het dek en
zeide tot Uilenspiegel:
--Breng mij bij dien admiraal, die u niet wilde gelooven toen gij
vorst voorspeldet.
--Ga zonder dat men u leide, zeide Uilenspiegel.
Lamme toog henen, nadat hij de deur zijner keuken goed dichtgedaan
had. De admiraal stond op het dek in de verte te turen, om te zien
of hij geenerlei beweging bespeurde langs den kant van de stad.
Lamme naderde hem en sprak:
--Messire admiraal, mag een nederige kok u zijne meening laten kennen?
--Spreek, mijn jongen, zei de admiraal.
--Heer, zeide Lamme, het water ontdooit in de kruiken, het gevogelte
wordt weder murw; de worst verliest hare schimmel van rijm; de boter
wordt slap; de olie vloeibaar; het zout vochtig. Weldra valt de regen
en zijn wij gered, heer admiraal.
--Wie zijt gij? vroeg messire Worst.
--Ik ben, zeide hij, Lamme Goedzak, kok op de vlieboot den Briel. En
als al de groote geleerden, die sterrekijkers beweren te zijn, zoo
goed in de sterren kunnen lezen als ik in mijne sausen, zouden zij
ons kunnen zeggen, dat het dezen nacht zal dooien, met groot gedruisch
van tempeest en van hagel; maar de dooi zal niet aanhouden.
En Lamme keerde terug bij Uilenspiegel, tot denwelken hij zei rond
den middag:
--Wat heb ik voorspeld? De hemel wordt duister, de wind blaast
geweldig; een warme regen valt; daar is reeds een voet water op 't ijs.
En 's avonds riep hij blijde uit:
--De Noordzee is gezwollen: het is het uur van den vloed; de hooge
baren, die in de Zuiderzee komen, breken het ijs, hetwelk in groote
stukken barst en springt op de schepen; het fonkelt en glinstert;
daar is de hagel. De admiraal beveelt ons met onze vloot terug te
trekken van vóór Amsterdam, en dit met zooveel water als ons grootste
schip noodig heeft. Hier zijn wij in de haven van Enkhuizen. De zee
vriest weer toe. Ik ben profeet, en 't is een gunst van den Heer.
En Uilenspiegel zeide:
--Wij zullen een glas drinken en Hem loven en danken.
En de winter verzwond en de zomer kwam.
XIX.
In de Oogstmaand, als de volgepropte hennen doof blijven voor 't geroep
van den haan, die heur zijne liefde toekraait, zeide Uilenspiegel
tot zijne matrozen en soldaten:
--De bloedige hertog is te Utrecht; hij durft er een lieftallig
plakkaat afkondigen, hetwelk onder meer genadige giften belooft:
honger, dood, ondergang voor de inwoneren der Nederlanden, die zich
niet onderwerpen. Alles wat nog recht staat, zegt hij, zal neergehaald
worden, en Zijn Koninklijke Majesteit zal het land bevolken met
vreemdelingen. Bijt, hertog, bijt! De vijl breekt de tanden der
adderen; wij, wij zijn vijlen! Vive le Geus!
... Alva, het bloed maakt u dronken! Meent gij, dat wij uwe
bedreigingen vreezen of aan uwe goedertierenheid gelooven? Uw
roemrijke regimenten, wier lof gij door heel de wereld verkondigdet,
uwe schepen, wier naam alleen uwen overmoed schetsen, bleven zeven
maanden lang Haarlem beschieten, een zwakke stede, door heure poorters
verdedigd. Zij zijn als gewone stervelingen in de lucht gesprongen,
bij 't ontploffen der mijnen; poorters begoten ze edelmoedig met pik;
eindelijk behaalden zij een roemvolle zege: zij keelden ontwapende
vijanden. Hoort gij Gods uur slaan, bloedige beul?
... De stede verloor haar wakkere verdedigers, hare steenen zweetten
bloed. Bij heure belegering verloor en verteerde zij twaalfhonderd
tachtigduizend gulden. De bisschop is terug in de stede; met vlugge
hand en vroolijke tronie herwijdt hij de kerken; don Frederik woont die
wijdingen bij; de bisschop wascht hem de handen, dewelke voor God rood
zullen blijven, en hij gebruikt het Avondmaal onder de beide gedaanten,
wat aan het arme gemeen niet geoorloofd wordt. En de klokken luiden, en
de beiaard werpt in de lucht zijn stille, welluidende tonen: 't is als
een engelenkoor op een kerkhof. Oog om oog, tand om tand! Vive le Geus!
XX.
Toen waren de Geuzen te Vlissingen, waar Nele koorts vatte. Gedwongen
het schip te verlaten, werd zij ingenomen bij Peeters, een hervormde,
op de Turfkaai.
Uilenspiegel, hoewel treurig, was toch blijde als hij dacht, dat de
Spaansche kogels heur niet konden treffen in dat bed, waar zij zeker
zou genezen.
En, met Lamme, was hij gedurig bij heur, om heur goed en liefdevol
te verzorgen. En daar koutten zij met elkander.
--Trouwe vriend, zei Uilenspiegel eens, kent gij het nieuws?
--Neen, mijn zoon, zei Lamme.
--Hebt gij de vlieboot gezien, die laatst onze vloot kwam versterken,
en weet gij wie daar alle dagen speelt op de vedel?
--Ten gevolge van de laatste verkoudheid, zeide Lamme, tuiten mijne
beide ooren en ben ik wat doof. Waarom lacht gij, mijn zoon?
Maar Uilenspiegel vervolgde zijn rede en sprak:
--Eens hoorde ik heur een Vlaamsch liedeken zingen, en heure stem
was zoo zoet als die van een engel.
--Laas! zeide Lamme, zij ook speelde op de vedel en zong.
--Kent gij de andere tijding? vervolgde Uilenspiegel.
--Neen, mijn zoon, antwoordde Lamme.
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Bevel is ons gegeven, met onze booten de Schelde op te varen tot vóór
Antwerpen, om daar vijandelijke schepen te kapen of te verbranden. Maar
geen kwartier aan de mannen! Wat denkt gij daarvan, dikzak?
--Laas, zeide Lamme, zullen wij in deze droeve landen nooit van
anders hooren dan van verbrandingen, verhangingen, verdrinkingen en
andere uitroeiingen van 't arme menschdom? Wanneer zal de gezegende
vrede komen, om rustig patrijzen te braden, kiekens te stoven en,
te midden van de eieren, de pensen te doen sissen in de braadpan? Ik
eet liever de zwarte; de witte zijn wat vet.
--Die zoete tijd zal komen, antwoordde Uilenspiegel, als wij, in
Vlaanderens boomgaarden, aan de appelaars, pruimelaars en kerselaars,
in stede van appels, pruimen en kersen, aan elken tak eenen Spanjaard
zien hangen.
--Ha, zeide Lamme, kon ik maar mijne vrouw terugvinden, mijn
teerbeminde, zeer geliefde, beminnelijke, zoete, trouwe vrouw! Want,
weet, mijn zoon, dat ik nooit horens droeg of zal dragen; daarvoor
was zij veel te ingetogen van aard; zij vluchtte den omgang met
andere mannen; zoo zij van schoone kleederen hield, was het alleen
uit vrouwelijke behoefte. Ik was heure keukenmeid, ik beken het
volgeerne; waarom ben ik het niet meer! Doch ik was ook haar meester
en echtgenoot.
--Zwijg toch met uw gesuf, zei Uilenspiegel. Hoort gij den admiraal
roepen: "Licht de ankers!" en de kapiteins, die zijn commando
herhalen? Wij moeten in zee steken.
--Waarom vertrekt gij zoo vroeg? zeide Nele tot Uilenspiegel.
--Wij gaan naar de schepen, antwoordde hij.
--Zonder mij? sprak zij.
--Ja, zei Uilenspiegel.
--Bedenkt gij niet, vroeg zij, hoe ongerust ik over u wezen zal?
--Liefste, sprak Uilenspiegel, mijn vel is van ijzer.
--Gij spot, zeide zij. Ik zie niets dan uw wambuis, dat van laken is,
doch geenszins van ijzer; daaronder is uw lijf, dat van vleesch en been
is, lijk het mijne. Wie zal u verbinden als gij gekwetst zijt? Moet
gij moederziel alleen sterven, te midden van de strijders? Ik zal
met u gaan.
--Laas, zeide hij, als de lansen, kogels, zweerden, aksten, hamers,
mij sparen, maar op uw liefelijk lichaam vallen, wat moet ik, nietdeug,
dan doen op de wereld zonder u?
Maar Nele zeide:
--Ik wil u volgen, er zal geen gevaar zijn; ik zal mij verbergen in
de houten schansen, waar de busschutters staan.
--Als gij vertrekt, dan blijf ik; en men zal zeggen, dat uw vriend
Uilenspiegel lafaard is en verrader; maar luister naar mijn lied:
    IJzeren is mijn harentuit,
    Daar schutte natuur mij mede.
    Lederen is mijn eersten huid,
    Stalen is mijn tweede.
    Laat de dood, de leelijke, wreede,
    Loeren naar een ander buit.
    Lederen is mijn eerste huid,
    Stalen is mijn tweede.
    "Leven" steekt op mijn vendel uit,
    Leven in 't licht der rede.
    Lederen is mijn eerste huid,
    Stalen is mijn tweede.
En zingend toog hij henen, niet zonder den trillenden mond en de
liefelijke oogen te kussen van de koortsachtige Nele, die lachte en
weende te gelijk.
De Geuzen zijn vóór Antwerpen, zij kapen Alva's schepen tot in de
haven. Zij komen in lichten dag in de stad, verlossen gevangenen en
nemen paapschgezinden om tot rantsoen te dienen. Met geweld doen zij de
poorters opstaan, en dwingen eenigen hunner hen sprakeloos te volgen,
onder doodsbedreiging.
Uilenspiegel zeide tot Lamme:
--De zoon des admiraals is gevangen bij den schouteet; wij moeten
hem verlossen.
Zij dringen in het huis van den schout en vinden den jongeling,
dien zij zochten, in gezelschap van een dikbuikigen monnik, dewelke
hem een grammoedige predikatie hield om hem terug te brengen in
den schoot Onzer Moeder, de Heilige Kerk. Maar de jonge snaak
vroeg of hij hem niets beters kon aanbieden. Hij gaat henen met
Uilenspiegel. Ondertusschen grijpt Lamme den monnik bij zijne kap,
en doet hem vóór zich gaan in de straten van Antwerpen, zeggende:
--Gij zijt honderd gulden weerd: maak uw pak en ga vóór. Waarom gaat
gij zoo traag? Hebt gij lood in uwe schoenen? Wat rapper, spekzak,
vleeschbank, soepketel!
De monnik antwoordde, in woede ontstoken:
--Goed, mijnheer de Geus, ik ga; maar, met al den eerbied, dien ik
uwe schietbus verschuldigd ben, veroorloof ik mij te zeggen, dat gij
zoo dik zijt als ik.
Maar Lamme stiet hem voort en sprak:
--Hoe vermeet gij u uw onnut, vadsig kloostervet te vergelijken met
mijn Vlamingvet, dat eerlijk gekweekt werd door arbeid, vermoeienis
en gevecht? Gauw wat, of ik jaag u voort met eene spoor op de punt
van mijnen schoen.
Maar de monnik kon niet loopen, hij was gansch buiten adem, en Lamme
insgelijks. En zoo kwamen zij op het schip.
XXI.
Nadat de Geuzen, Rammekens, Geertruidenberg, Alkmaar hadden genomen,
stevenden zij weder naar Vlissingen.
Nele, die genezen was, wachtte Uilenspiegel af aan de haven.
Hem ontwarend, riep zij:
--Thijl, mijn vriend Thijl, zijt ge niet gewond?
Uilenspiegel zong:
    "Leven" steekt op mijn vendel uit,
    Leven in 't licht der rede.
    Lederen is mijn eerste huid,
    Stalen is mijn tweede.
--Laas! zeide Lamme, trekkebeenend: de kogels, granaten, kettingkogels
regenen rondom hem, en hij voelt er niets van dan den wind. Gij zijt
voorzeker een geest, Uilenspiegel, en gij ook Nele, want gij zijt
beiden altijd jeugdig en luimig.
--Wat hebt gij aan uw been? vroeg Nele tot Lamme.
--Ik ben geen geest en zal het nooit wezen, sprak hij. Ik heb dan
ook een bijlslag gekregen in mijne bil,--mijne vrouw had er zulke
ronde en schoone!--zie, ik bloed. Laas! waarom is ze niet hier om
mij te verzorgen?
Maar Nele antwoordde grammoedig:
--Waarom vraagt gij naar een meineedige vrouwe?
--Spreek geen kwaad van haar, antwoordde Lamme.
--Neem, zeide Nele, hier is balsem, dien ik meebracht voor
Uilenspiegel; strijk hem op uwe wond.
Toen Lamme zijne wond verbonden had, werd hij blijgeestig, want de
balsem stilde de bijtende smert; en zij klommen alle drie op het schip.
Toen Nele den monnik met gekluisterde handen op het dek zag wandelen,
vroeg zij:
--Wie is die? Dien zag ik reeds; en ik meen hem te kennen.
--Gelijk hij waait en draait, is die honderd gulden rantsoen weerd,
zeide Lamme.
XXII.
Dien dag was 't kermis op de vloot van de Geuzen. Niettegenstaande
het gure weder der Wintermaand, niettegenstaande regen en sneeuw,
waren al de Geuzen op het dek van de schepen. De zilveren halvemanen
flikkerden op de Zeeuwsche hoedekens.
En Uilenspiegel zong:
    Leiden is ontzet, de bloedhertog
    Wijkt uit de Nederlanden;
    Klare klokken, klinkt,
    Beiaards, schatert uw deuntjes uit;
    Rinkelt, roomers en bottels.
    Kreeg de doghond slaag,
    Staartneder, met bloedend oog,
    Loopt hij de stokken weer in.
    Zijn gescheurde muil
    Hijgt en huivert.
    Weg is de bloedhertog:
    Rinkelt, roomers en bottels. Leve de Geus!
    Bijten wou hij zijn eigen.
    De stokken brijzelden zijn gebit.
    Met hangenden suffen kop,
    Denkt hij aan dagen van moord en vraatlust.
    Weg is de bloedhertog:
    Slaat op de glorietrom,
    Slaat op de krijgstrom!
    Leve de Geus!
    Thans schreeuwt hij den duivel toe: "Koop
    Mijn hondsche ziel voor één uur kracht".
    "Uw ziel, roept de duivel,
    Uw ziel of een boestring, dat 's eender."
    Geen tand past op een tand.
    De harde brokken moest ge maar laten.
    Weg is de bloedhertog:
    Leve de Geus!
    De straathondjes, scheef, scheel, schurftig,
    Die leven en krepeeren op vuilnishoopen,
    Heffen hun poot op, beurt om beurt,
    Naar hem, die doodde uit moordzucht....
    Leve de Geus!
    "Hij hield van vrouw noch vriend,
    Van vreugd, noch zon, noch meester,
    Slechts van de Dood, zijn bruid,
    Die hem de pooten knakte,
    Tot blijdans vóór de bruiloft;
    Want heele menschen lust ze niet.
    Slaat op de vreugdtrom.
    Leve de Geus!"
    En de straathondjes mank,
    Scheef, schurftig en scheel,
    Heffen nog eens den poot op
    Dat het ziedt en zout,
    En met hen brakken en winden,
    Rekels van Hongarije,
    Van Brabant, Namen en Luxemburg.
    Leve de Geus!
    En triestig, met schuimmuil,
    Krepeert hij vóór zijn meester,
    Die hem schopt met den voet,
    Wijl hij te weinig beet.
    Ter helle huwt hij Dood.
    Hem heet zij: Mijn hertog;
    Hij haar: Mijn inquisitie.
    Leve de Geus!
    Klare klokken, klinkt,
    Beiaard, schater uw deuntjes uit;
    Rinkelt, roomers en bottels:
    Leve de Geus!
VIJFDE BOEK.
I.
Als Lamme's monnik gewaar werd, dat de Geuzen geenszins zijnen dood
wilden, doch een rantsoen voor hem eischten, begon hij het hoofd op
te steken.
--Ziet, zeide hij, terwijl hij met woede op het dek stapte en
schuddebolde, ziet in welken afgrond van vuile, zwarte en afgrijselijke
gruwelen ik gevallen ben, toen ik den voet in deze verdoemde kuip
zette. Zoo ik hier niet was, zou ik, gezalfd door den Heer....
--Met hondenvet? vroegen de Geuzen.
--Honden zijt gij zelven, antwoordde de monnik, zijne rede vervolgend,
ja, schurftige, drekkige straathonden, met het vel over de beenderen,
die het lustige pad van Onze Moeder, de Heilige Roomsche Kerk, hebt
verlaten om de schrale wegen van uwe havelooze Hervormde Kerk in te
slaan. Ja! ware ik hier niet op uwen klomp, lang reeds had de Heer,
Onze God hem doen verzwelgen in den diepsten afgrond der zee, met u,
uw vermaledijde wapenen, uwe duivelsche donderbussen, uw zingenden
kapitein, uw heiligschennende halvemanen, ja! tot in het diepste
van den onpeilbaren bodem van het rijk Satans, waar gijlie niet
zult branden, o neen! maar vervriezen, beven en sterven van koude,
de eeuwigheid der eeuwigheden lang. Ja, de God des hemels zal aldus
het vuur uitdooven van uwen goddeloozen haat tegen Onze Zoete Moeder,
de Heilige Roomsche Kerk, tegen de genadige santen, de eerwaarde
bisschoppen en de gezegende plakkaten, die zoo zachtmoedig en wijselijk
uitgedacht zijn. Ja, en van het hoogste des hemelrijks zal ik u zien,
paars lijk beeten, of wit lijk rapen, van koude. Zoo zij en zoo weze!
De matrozen, soldaten en scheepsjongens spotten met hem en schoten,
met blaaspijpen, droge erwten naar hem. En met zijne handen beschermde
hij zijn gelaat tegen die kogels.
II.
De bloedige hertog had onze landen verlaten, en de heeren Medina Celi
en Requesens regeerden ze met minder wreedheid. Vervolgens bestuurden
de Staten-Generaal, in naam van den koning.
Die van Zeeland en Holland, bevoordeeld door de zee en de dijken,
die hun natuurlijke wallen en vestingen zijn, openden ondertusschen,
aan den God der vrijen, vrije tempelen, alwaar de paapschgezinde
beulen naast hen hunne lofzangen konden aanheffen; en de Prins van
Oranje, de edele Zwijger, hield zich druk bezig met het stichten van
een stadhouderlijk en koninklijk huis.
Belgieland werd verwoest door de Walen, die ontevreden waren over
de Pacificatie van Gent, dewelke, naar men zeide, allen haat moest
uitdooven. En die Waalsche Paternosterknechten, met groote zwarte
rozenkransen om den hals, van dewelke tweeduizend te Spienne,
in Henegouw, werden gevonden, stalen twaalfhonderd, ja, tot twee
duizend ossen en peerden, onder de beste, trokken door velden en
sompen, ontvoerden vrouwen en meidekens, aten steeds zonder betalen,
en verbrandden in de schuren de gewapende boeren, die niet gedwee de
vrucht van hunne noeste vlijt lieten rooven.
En die van het volk zeiden tot elkander: "Don Juan gaat komen
met zijne Spanjolen, en Zijne Groote Hoogheid zal komen met zijne
paapschgezinde Franschen: en de Zwijger, dewelke gerust over Holland,
Zeeland, Gelderland, het Sticht, Overijsel wil heerschen, staat bij
geheime overeenkomst Belgieland af, opdat de heer van Anjou koning
kunne worden van hetzelve".
Eenigen uit het volk behielden nochtans hun vertrouwen. "De heeren
der Staten, zeiden zij, hebben twintig duizend goed gewapende mannen,
met vele kanonnen en een goede ruiterij. Zij zullen al de uitheemsche
soldaten wederstaan".
Maar de omzichtigen spraken: "De Heeren der Staten hebben twintig
duizend man op papier, maar geenszins te velde; zij hebben geene
ruiterij en laten, op eene mijl van hun kamp, hunne peerden stelen
door de Paternosterknechten. Zij hebben geen geschut, want, terwijl
wij er hier van doen hebben, hebben zij besloten honderd donderbussen
met kogels en kruit te zenden aan don Sebastiaan van Portugal; en men
weet niet waar de twee millioen daalders henen zijn, die wij in vier
maal als beden en schattingen hebben betaald. De poorters van Gent en
Brussel wapenen zich: Gent voor de hervorming en Brussel eveneens. Te
Brussel spelen de vrouwen op de tamboerijn, terwijl heure mannen aan
de vestingen werken. En het onversaagde Gent stuurt aan het lustige
Brussel het kruit en de donderbussen, welke hem ontbreken, om zich
te verdedigen tegen Malcontenten en Spanjaards.
"En elkeen, in de steden en op het platteland, ziet, dat men vertrouwen
moet hebben noch in onze heeren noch in zoovele anderen. En wij,
poorters en die van 't gemeen, zijn treurig in ons hert als wij
zien, dat, terwijl wij ons geld gaven en bereid zijn ook ons bloed
te geven, er geen vooruitgang komt voor het welzijn van den grond
onzer vaderen. En Belgieland is bang en gram, omdat het geen trouwe
hoofdmannen heeft, die het naar het gevecht brengen en naar de zege,
met groote inspanning van de wapenen, die gereed zijn tegen de vijanden
der vrijheid".
En de omzichtigen prevelden tot elkaar:
"In de Pacificatie van Gent bezwoeren de heeren van Holland en België
de uitdooving van allen haat, wederkeerigen onderstand tusschen
de Belgische Staten en de Nederlandsche Staten; verklaarden zij de
plakkaten van geener weerde, alle verbeurdverklaringen opgeheven, den
vrede tusschen de beide godsdiensten; zij beloofden alle hoegenaamde
zuilen, zegeteekenen, opschriften en standbeelden te zullen afbreken,
welke de hertog van Alva tot onze schande opgericht heeft. Doch in de
herten der hoofden blijft alle haat woeden; edelen en geestelijken
stoken verdeeldheid onder de Staten van het Verbond; zij krijgen
geld om de soldaten te betalen, en houden het voor zich om te zuipen
en te vreten; vijftien duizend gedingen wegens terugvordering van
verbeurdverklaarde goederen blijven opgeschort; Lutheranen en Roomschen
verbinden zich tegen de Calvinisten; de wettige erfgenamen vermogen
niet, de roovers uit hunne goederen te drijven; het standbeeld van
den hertog is nedergehaald, maar de beeltenis van de Inquisitie is
in al de herten".
En het arme volk en de jammerende poorters wachtten steeds op den
trouwen en wakkeren hoofdman, die hen zou brengen naar het gevecht
voor de vrijheid.
En zij zeiden tot elkander: "Waar zijn de doorluchtige onderteekenaren
van het Eedverbond, allen vereenigd, naar zij zeiden, voor het heil
des Vaderlands? Waarom sloten die valsche lieden een zoo "heilig
verbond", als zij het dadelijk daarna zouden verbreken? Waarom zich
met zooveel gezwets vereenigen, de gramschap des konings verwekken,
om daarna uiteen te gaan, als verraders en bloodaards? Met vijfhonderd
als zij waren, groote en kleine heeren, als broeders vereenigd, konden
zij ons van de Spaansche furie bevrijden; maar zij offeren België's
heil op aan hun eigen welzijn, zooals ook Egmond en Hoorne deden.
... Laas! zeiden zij, nu zal don Juan komen, die heerschzuchtige
vrouwengek, vijand van Philippus, maar nog grootere vijand van onze
landen. Hij komt voor den paus en zich zelf. Edelen en geestelijken
plegen verraad".
En zij beginnen een schijnoorlog. Op de muren van de straten en
stegen van Gent en van Brussel, tot zelfs op de masten van de schepen
der Geuzen, zag men toen uitplakken de namen van de legerhoofden
en bevelhebbers van versterkte plaatsen, die verraad pleegden:
die van den graaf van Liedekerke, dewelke zijn slot niet verdedigde
tegen don Juan; van den provoost van Luik, dewelke de stede aan don
Juan wilde verkoopen; van de heeren van Aerschot, van Mansfeld, van
Berlaymont, van Rennenberg; van den Staatsraad, van George Lalaing,
stadhouder van Friesland; van het legerhoofd, den heer van Rossignol,
afgezant van don Juan, bemiddelaar tusschen Philippus en Jaureguy,
den onbehendige, die moord wilde plegen op den Prins van Oranje; den
naam van den aartsbisschop van Kamerijk, die de Spanjaards binnen
de stede wilde laten komen; de namen der jezuïeten van Antwerpen,
die drie tonnen gouds--dat maakt twee millioen gulden--boden aan
de Staten om het kasteel niet af te breken, om het voor don Juan te
behouden; van den bisschop van Luik; van de Roomsche predikanten, die
de patriotten belaagden; van den bisschop van Utrecht, door de poorters
om zijn verraad uit het Sticht verdreven; van de bedelorden, die te
Gent konkelden ten voordeele van don Juan. Die van 's Hertogenbosch
stelden aan de kaak den naam van den karmeliet Pieter, die, geholpen
door zijnen bisschop en de geestelijkheid, zich sterk maakte de stede
aan don Juan over te leveren.
Te Dowaai hingen zij echter den rector der Hoogeschool in beeltenis
niet op, die insgelijks Spaanschgezind was geworden. Doch op de schepen
der Geuzen las men, op den buik van groote poppen, die bij den hals
aan de raas hingen, de namen van monniken, abten en prelaten; die van
de achttienhonderd rijke vrouwen en dochters uit het begijnenhof van
Mechelen, die, op eigen kosten, de beulen des vaderlands met vederen
en goudborduurselen versierden, en voorzagen in hunlieder onderhoud.
En op die poppen, schandpalen voor de verraders, las men de namen
van den markgraaf van Harrault, bevelhebber van de versterkte plaats
Philippeville, die oorlogsmunitie en mondbehoeften vermorste, om
naderhand de plaats aan den vijand te leveren, onder voorwendsel
dat hij gebrek had aan leeftocht; dien van Belver, dewelke Limburg
overgaf, alswanneer de stede het nog acht maanden volhouden kon; dien
van den voorzitter van den Raad van Vlaanderen; van den magistraat
van Mechelen, die zijne stede bewaarde voor don Juan, van de heeren
van het Rekenhof van Gelderland, dat gesloten was uit hoofde van
verraad; van die van den Raad van Brabant, van de kanselarij des
hertogdoms; van den privaten raad en van den raad van financiën; van
den hoogbaljuw en burgemeester van Meenen; van de slechte buren van
Artesië, die ongehinderd twee duizend Franschen doorlieten, dewelken
hier kwamen plunderen.
--Laas! zeiden de burgers tot elkaar, nu dat de hertog van Anjou den
voet in onze landen gezet heeft, wil hij hier koning zijn; zaagt gij
hem bij zijne inkomst in Bergen, klein, met groote heupen, een dikken
neus, een gele tronie, een spottenden mond?
... 't Is een groote prins, liefhebber van buitengewone minnarijen;
het moet een reus van een prins zijn, want men noemt hem: monseigneur
en mijnheer Zijne Groote Hoogheid van Anjou.
Uilenspiegel was droomerig.
En hij zong:
    De lucht is blauw, de lucht is klaar,
    Rouwfloers over de vanen!
    Rouw om 't gevest der degens!
    Verbergt uw juweelen,
    Uw spiegels gekeerd:
    Ik zing het lied van den Dood,
    Het lied der verraders.
    Ze hebben de fiere landen
    Op den buik en de keel getrapt,
    Brabant, Vlaanderen, Henegouw,
    Antwerpen, Artoois, Luxemburg.
    Adel en clerus verraden.
    Vuig loon verlokt, verleidt.
    Ik zing het lied der verraders.
    Als de vijand overal plundert,
    Als de Spanjaard Antwerpen binnenrukt,
    Trekken priesters, prelaten, legerhoofden
    De straten der stede door,
    Met zijden gewaden, vol goudstikkerij,
    En tronies blinkend van goeden wijn,
    Stellend hun schande ten toon.
    Door hen zal Inquisitie
    Herrijzen in triomf;
    En nieuwe titellui,
    Zullen doofstommen vastzetten
    Voor ketterij.
    Ik zing het lied der verraders.
    Onderteekenaren van 't Eedverbond,
    Lafhartige onderteekenaren,
    Wezen uw namen gevloekt.
    Waar blijft gij in 't uur des strijds?
    Als raven volgt gij
    Den drijf der Spanjaards.
    Slaat op de rouwtrom.
    Belgenland, eenmaal
    Veroordeelt u de toekomst,
    Daar ge, gewapend, u plunderen liet.
    Doch, toekomst, draal;
    Zie de verraders aan 't werk:
    Met twintig, met duizend,
    Bekleeden ze alle posten,
    De grooten stellen de kleinen aan.
    Het eens zijn ze 't
    Om den weerstand te verhindren,
    Door verdeeldheid en traagheid:
    Hun verradersleus!
    Rouwfloers over de spiegels,
    Rouw om 't gevest der degens.
    't Is het lied der verraders.
    Rebellen verklaren zij
    Spanjolen en malcontenten,
    Verbiedend hun bij te staan
    Met brood en bed,
    Met lood en kruit.
    En wordt er een gevangen,
    Om te hangen,
    Dadelijk laten zij hem los.
    Staat op! roepen die van Brussel;
    Staat op! roepen die van Gent
    En het Belgische volk.
    Arme lui, men wil u verpletteren,
    Tusschen den koning en den paus,
    Die tegen Vlaanderen
    Een kruistocht predikt.
    Ze komen, de veile knechten,
    Af op den reuk van het bloed;
    Benden honden,
    Slangen en hyena's,
    Hongerig, dorstig.
    Arme vadergrond,
    Rijp voor verval en dood!
    Niet don Juan maakt het Farnese,
    Des pausen lieveling,
    Makkelijk in 't land,
    Maar wie gij overlaaddet
    Met goed en eere,
    Wie uw vrouwen de biecht afnamen,
    Uw dochters en uw kinderen!
    Die wierpen u ter aarde,
    En de Spanjaard zet u
    Het mes op de keel.
    Een snoode spot was 't
    Dat ze te Brussel
    De komst van Oranje vierden!
    Toen men op de vaart
    Die macht van vuurwerk zag,
    Waar de vreugd uit sprankte en knalde,
    En al die zegebooten,
    Tafreelen en tapijten,
    Arm België, dan vertoonde men
    Een oude historie:
    Joseph verkocht door zijn broeders.
III.
Daar de monnik zag, dat men hem maar liet praten, maakte hij nog
grooter misbaar, en de matrozen en soldaten, om hem nog meer op
te hitsen, spraken kwaad van de Maagd, van de santen en van de
godvruchtige praktijken der Heilige Roomsche Kerk.
En, in woede ontstoken, braakte hij duizend beleedigingen uit:
--Ja! schreeuwde hij, ja, ik ben hier wel in het hol van de Geuzen! Ja,
dat zijn wel die verdoemde opvreters van de landen! En men zegt,
dat de inquisiteur, de heilige man, te veel van die galgebrokken
verbrand heeft! Integendeel: er blijft nog veel te veel van dat
gebroed over. Ja, op die goede en brave schepen van Onzen Heer Koning,
die vroeger zoo zindelijk waren en zoo goed geschrobd, wemelt nu dat
ongedierte van Geuzen, ja, het stinkend ongedierte. Ja, allen zijn
vuil, stinkend, afschuwelijk ongedierte, de kapitein, die zingt van
's morgens tot 's avonds, de kok met zijn dikken, goddeloozen buik,
en ook al de anderen, met hun heiligschennende halvemanen. Ja, als de
koning zijne schepen met geschut zal doen kuischen, zal er voor meer
dan honderdduizend gulden kruit en kogelen noodig zijn om die vuile,
leelijke, stinkende besmetting te verdrijven. Ja, gij allen zijt
geboren in de alkoof van vrouwe Lucifer, die veroordeeld was om te
wonen met Satan, tusschen muren van ongedierte, onder gordijnen van
ongedierte, op een bed van ongedierte. Ja, en dáár is het, dat zij,
in hun afschuwelijke minnarijen, de Geuzen ter wereld brachten. Ja,
en ik spuw op ulieden.
Bij die rede, zeiden de Geuzen tot elkander, zoodat hij het hoorde:
--Waarom onderhouden wij dien luien hond, dewelke niets doet dan
beleedigingen braken? Wij zouden hem beter ophangen!
En dra brachten zij alles in gereedheid.
Toen de monnik zag, dat de koorde vastgeknoopt was en de ladder tegen
den mast stond, en dat men zijne handen ging binden, zeide hij op
jammerenden toon:
--Hebt medelijden met mij, heeren Geuzen, 't is de duivel der
grammoedigheid, die spreekt in mijn hert, maar geenszins uw nederige
gevangene, een arme monnik, die maar éénen hals heeft op deze wereld;
genadige heeren, weest bermhertig: 't was niet gemeend; sluit mijnen
mond, als gij wilt, met eene prop; aangenaam is dit niet, neen,
maar om Godswil, hangt mij niet op!
Maar zij luisterden niet en trokken hem naar de ladder,
niettegenstaande zijn heftigen wederstand. Toen huilde hij zoo
schromelijk, dat Lamme zeide tot Uilenspiegel, die bij hem in de
keuken was om hem op te passen:
--Mijn vriend! mijn vriend! zij hebben in den stal een verken gestolen
en daar zijn ze bezig met het te kelen. Ho! de dieven! kon ik maar op!
Uilenspiegel klom op het dek en zag niets dan den monnik. Toen deze
hem ontwaarde, viel hij op zijne knieën en riep, met de handen naar
hem uitgestoken:
--Messire kapitein, kapitein van de wakkere Geuzen, geducht te land
en ter zee, uwe soldaten willen mij ophangen, omdat ik zondigde met
mijn tonge; dat is een onrechtveerdige straf, messire kapitein, want
dan moesten al de advocaten, procureurs, predikanten en al de vrouwen
met hennep begiftigd worden, en zou de wereld zekerlijk uitsterven;
messire, red mij van de koorde: ik zal voor u bidden, gij zult niet
verdoemd wezen; schenk mij vergiffenis. De spreekduivel sleepte mij mee
en deed mij gedurig snateren: dit is een groot ongeluk voor mij. Dan
verbittert zich mijn arme gal en doet ze mij allerhande dingen zeggen,
die niet gemeend zijn. Genade, messire kapitein, en gij allen, mijne
heeren, bidt voor mij.
Plotseling verscheen Lamme in zijn hemde op het dek, en hij zei:
--Kapitein en vrienden, wat ben ik blijde: 't was maar de monnik,
dien ik hoorde schreeuwen, en geenszins het verken. Uilenspiegel,
mijn zoon, ik heb een uitmuntend plan uitgedacht ten opzichte van
Zijne Paterschap; schenk hem het leven, maar laat hem niet vrij, of
hij speelt ons nog slechte poetsen op het schip: laat liever voor hem
op het dek een enge, goed verluchte kooi maken, in dewelke hij slechts
kan zitten en slapen, gelijk voor de kapoenen; laat mij hem spijzen,
en hij worde gehangen als hij zooveel niet eet als ik wil.
--Hij worde gehangen, als hij niet eet, zeiden Uilenspiegel en
de Geuzen.
--Wat schikt gij met mij te doen, dikzak? vroeg de monnik.
--Dat zult ge later gewaarworden, antwoordde Lamme.
En Uilenspiegel deed zooals Lamme wilde, en de monnik werd in de kooi
gestoken, en elkeen kon hem op het gemak komen zien.
Lamme was terug in de keuken gekeerd; Uilenspiegel volgde hem daar
en hoorde hem twisten met Nele:
--Ik leg mij te bed niet, zeide hij, neen, ik leg mij te bed niet;
anderen zouden mijne sausen komen vermorsen; neen, ik blijf in mijn
bed niet liggen lijk een kalf!
--Maak u niet boos, Lamme, zeide Nele, of uwe wond gaat opnieuw open,
en gij sterft.
--Wel, zeide hij, dan sterf ik: ik ben moede van te leven zonder mijne
vrouw. Is het niet hard genoeg voor mij, heur verloren te hebben, dat
gij mij, den kok van het schip, nog wilt beletten zelf te zorgen voor
den pot? Weet gij dan niet, dat geur van sausen en stoverije gezondheid
baart? Zij voedt zelfs mijnen geest en pantsert mij tegen rampspoed.
--Lamme, zeide Nele, gij moet luisteren naar onzen raad en u laten
genezen door ons.
--Ik wil mij laten genezen, sprak Lamme; maar dat geen andere, geen
weetniet, geen leepoogige, stinkneuzige, etterige, slijmerige rabauw
zich verstoute hier binnen te komen, om hier als kok te tronen in
mijne plaats, en met zijn vuile vingeren mijne sausen te vermorsen,
of ik sla hem den kop in met mijn houten pollepel, dewelke dan van
ijzer zou zijn.
--Maar, zeide Uilenspiegel, gij moet toch een helper hebben, gij
zijt ziek....
--Een helper, ik! zeide Lamme; ik, een helper! Om dat te zeggen,
moet gij zoo vol ondankbaarheid zijn als eene worst, vol gekapt
vleesch. Een helper, Thijl, en gij zijt het, die dit zegt tot mij,
uwen vriend, die u zoo lang en zoo lekker gevoed heeft! Nu gaat mijne
wond zeker weer open. Slechte vriend, wie anders hier zou uwe spijzen
bereiden, dan ik? Wat zoudt gij beiden doen, als ik hier niet was om
u, kapitein-hoofdman, en u, Nele, een of ander smakelijk gerecht voor
te dienen?
--Wij zouden ons behelpen en zelven den pot koken, zeide Uilenspiegel.
--Den pot koken? zeide Lamme. Gij zijt goed om er van te eten, om zijn
reuk op te snuiven; maar om hem gereed te maken, neen: arme vriend en
kapitein-hoofdman, met al den eerbied, dien ik u verschuldigd ben,
ik zou u in reepen gesneden weitasschen geven en gij zoudt ze eten
voor vette darmen; laat mij, mijn vriend, hier kok blijven, of ik
verdroog als een stok.
--Blijf dan kok, zeide Uilenspiegel; maar geneest gij niet, dan sluit
ik de keuken en eten wij niets dan beschuit.
--Ha! mijn zoon, zeide Lamme, die weende van geluk, gij zijt goed
als de Moeder Gods.
IV.
Doch hij scheen aan de beterhand.
Alle Zaterdagen zagen de Geuzen hem het middel van den monnik meten,
met een langen lederen riem.
Den eersten Zaterdag zeide hij:
--Vier voet.
Daarna mat hij zich zelven en sprak:
--Vier voet en half.
En hij scheen weemoedig.
Maar den achtsten Zaterdag, van den monnik sprekend, zeide hij vol
blijdschap:
--Vier voet en drij kwart.
En als hij den monnik de maat nam, zeide deze grammoedig tot Lamme:
--Wat wilt ge van mij, dikzak?
Maar Lamme stak zijne tong uit naar hem en zeide geen woord.
En, zevenmaal daags, zagen de soldaten en matrozen hem met een of
ander nieuw gerecht afkomen en hoorden zij hem zeggen tot den monnik:
--Hier zijn boonen met Vlaamsche boter: at gij er dergelijke in
uw convent? Gij hebt een goede tronie: mager wordt men niet op
de vloot van de Geuzen. Voelt gij geen kussen van vet in uwen rug
groeien? Weldra hoeft gij, om te slapen, op geene matras meer te
liggen.
Bij het tweede maal, zeide hij:
--Zie, hier zijn koekebakken naar de Brusselsche wijs; zie maar
wat blonde, goudgele tint zij kregen in de oven: ziet gij de boter
afdruipen? Zoo ook zal geschieden met het vet van uwen buik.
--Ik heb geen eetlust, zei de monnik.
--Maar gij moet eten, zei Lamme. Meent gij misschien, dat het
heetekoeken van boekweitbloem zijn? 't Is zuivere tarwe, eerweerde
vader, dikke, vette vader, 't is bloem van tarwemeel, vader met
vierdubbele kin: ik zie de vijfde reeds aankomen, en mijn hert is
verblijd. Eet!
--Laat mij met vrede, dikzak, zei de monnik.
Lamme, die grammoedig werd antwoordde:
--Ik beschik over uw leven: hebt gij liever de koorde dan een goede
teil erwtensoep met stukjes geroosterd brood, zooals ik er u dadelijk
eene zal brengen?
En toen Lamme met de teil kwam, vervolgde hij:
--Erwtensoep alleen is eigenlijk geen eetmaal: ik heb er dan ook een
schotel knoedelen naar Duitsche wijs bijgevoegd: dat zijn balletjes
deeg met krenten, in het kokend water geworpen; knoedelen zijn zware
kost, doch kweeken spek. Eet zooveel als gij kunt: hoe meer gij eet,
hoe liever ik u zie: gij moet den viesneus niet spelen, en niet blazen
alsof gij meer dan uwe bekomst hadt: eet! Is het niet beter te eten
dan hangen te bengelen aan eene koord? Laat uwe dij zien! zij wordt
ook dikker; twee voet en zeven duim omtrek. Waar vindt men nog eene
hesp, die zoo dik is?
Een uur naderhand kwam hij weer bij den monnik:
--Neem, zeide hij, hier zijn negen duifjes: men heeft ze opzettelijk
geschoten voor u, de onschuldige dieren, die, onbevreesd, boven de
schepen vlogen; versmaad ze niet; in hunnen buik stak ik een balletje
boter, broodkruim, geraspte muskaatnoot, kruidnagelen gestampt in een
koperen vijzel, dewelke blinkt als uw vel: mevrouw de zonne is gansch
verheugd zich te mogen spiegelen in een zoo helder gezicht als het uwe;
dat komt van het vet, van het goede vet, dat ik u bezorgde!
Voor den vijfden maaltijd, bracht hij een waterzoo.
--Wat denkt gij hiervan? vroeg hij hem. De zee draagt en spijst u;
meerder zou zij niet kunnen doen voor Zijne Koninklijke Majesteit. Ja,
ja, klaarblijkelijk zie ik de vijfde kin wassen, een weinigje meer
links dan rechts; wij zullen dien benadeelden kant moeten aanvetten,
want de Heer heeft gezeid: "Weest rechtveerdig jegens elkeen". Waarin
zou de rechtveerdigheid anders bestaan, dan in een rechtmatige
verdeeling van vet? Voor uw zesde maal breng ik u mosselen--die
oesters der armen--zooals gij er nooit kreegt in 't convent; dommeriken
laten ze koken en eten ze zóó op, doch dat is maar de inleiding der
stoverije: als zij gekookt zijn, moet men ze uit heure schelpen nemen,
heure tengere lichaampjes in een stoofpan leggen, dan zachtjes laten
stoven met selder, muskaatnoot en kruidnagelen en de saus binden met
bier en meel; de mosselen worden dan voorgediend met sneden geroosterd
en geboterd brood. Zoo deed ik voor u. Waarom zijn de kinderen een
zoo groote erkentelijkheid verschuldigd aan vader en moeder? Omdat
zij hun eene schuilplaats en liefde, maar vooral omdat zij hun eten
gaven: dienvolgens moet ge mij beminnen als uw vader en uwe moeder
te zamen, en zijt ge mij dezelfde dankbaarheid verschuldigd als hun:
maar zie toch zoo verbolgen naar mij niet.
... Als de mosselen gezakt zijn, breng ik u bierpap, goed gebonden met
meel, goed gesuikerd, met veel kaneel. Weet gij waarom? Opdat uw vet
doorschijnend zou worden en lustig op uw vel zou waggelen: als gij u
verroert, ziet men het alreeds. Daar klinkt de taptoe: slaap in vrede
zonder aan den dag van morgen te denken, in de zekerheid steeds uw
vette eetmalen terug te vinden, alsmede uw verkleefden vriend Lamme,
die ze u liefdevol zal geven.
--Ga henen, satansjong, en laat mij bidden, zeide de monnik.
--Bid, zeide Lamme, bid met begeleiding van een vroolijk gesnork:
bier en slaap geven vet, goed vet. Ik, ik ben blijde!
En Lamme trok naar zijn bed.
En de matrozen en soldaten zeiden tot hem:
--Waarom toch wilt gij dien vuilen monnik, die u geenerlei goed wil,
zoo rijkelijk spijzen?
--Laat mij begaan, zeide Lamme, ik verricht een schoon werk.
V.
Toen Wintermaand was gekomen, de maand der donkere dagen, zong
Uilenspiegel:
    Monseigneur, Zijn Doorluchtige Hoogheid,
    Rukt zijn mom af,
    Willend heerschen over België.
    De verspaanschte staten,
    Doch niet verangevijnscht,
    Beschikken over de belastingen.
    Slaat op de trommel
    Der angevijnsche davering!
    In hunne handen houden ze
    Domeinen, accijns en renten,
    't Benoemen der magistraten
    En de ambten meteen.
    Op de hervormden heeft hij 't gemunt,
    Monsieur Zijn Doorluchtige Hoogheid,
    Die in Frankrijk doorgaat voor atheïst.
    O, de angevijnsche davering!
    Want koning wil hij worden
    Door het zwaard en 't geweld,
    Alleenheerschend koning voorgoed,
    Die Monseigneur, en Doorluchtige Hoogheid.
    Innemen wil hij door verraad,
    Menig schoone stad en Antwerpen mee;
    Signorkens en pagaders, vroeg opgestaan,
    O, de angevijnsche davering!
    Niet op u, Frankrijk,
    Werpt zich het volk, in blinde woede;
    Niet uw edel lichaam treffen
    Moorddadige wapenen;
    Niet uw kinderen zijn het,
    Wier lijken, hoop op hoop,
    De Kipdorppoorte vullen.
    O, de angevijnsche davering!
    Neen, niet uw kinderen zijn het
    Die het volk van de schansen neergooit,
    Anjou is 't, Zijn Doorluchtige Hoogheid,
    Anjou is 't, de lijdelijke wufteling,
    Die leeft van uw bloed, o Frankrijk,
    En het onze wil drinken.
    Maar tusschen beker en lippen....
    O, de angevijnsche davering!
    Monsieur Zijn Doorluchtige Hoogheid,
    Schreeuwt in een weerlooze stad:
    Tue, tue, vive la messe!
    Met zijn mooie lievelingen,
    Wier oogen blinken
    Van 't schandevuur, schaamteloos schuw,
    Der ontucht zonder liefde.
    O, de angevijnsche davering!
    Hen velt men, niet u, arm volk,
    Op wien ze drukken met belasting,
    Zoutgeld, hoofdgeld, 't eerstenachtrecht,
    U misprijzend, daar ze u afpersen
    Koorn, paarden, wagens,
    Gij, die hun een vader zijt,
    O, de angevijnsche davering!
    Gij, die hun een moeder zijt,
    Zogend de brooddronkendheid
    Dier moedermoorders, welke, in den vreemde
    Uw naam bevlekken, o Frankrijk, overdaan
    Met den smook van hun glorie,
    Als ze hechten
    Door woeste wapenfeiten....
    O, de angevijnsche davering!
    Een bloempjen aan uw krijgskroon,
    Een provincie aan uw grondgebied.
    Laat den dwazen haan, ontucht en oorlog,
    Den voet op den strot,
    Fransch volk, manhaftig volk,
    Den voet die verplet!
    En al de volkeren krijgen u lief
    Om de angevijnsche davering!
VI.
In de Bloeimaand, als wanneer de Vlaamsche boerinnen 's nachts
langzaam drie zwarte boonen achter zich over het hoofd werpen, om
zich voor ziekte en dood te behoeden, ging Lamme's wond weder open;
de kok had een zware koorts en vroeg, dat men hem zou leggen op het
dek van het schip, rechtover de kooi van den monnik.
Uilenspiegel stond het geerne toe; doch uit vreeze, dat zijn vriend
in eenen aanval der ziekte overboord zou vallen, deed hij hem stevig
binden op zijn bed.
Zoodra Lamme een oogenblik bij zijn verstand was, vroeg hij of men
den monnik niet vergat; en hij stak zijne tong naar hem uit.
En de monnik zei:
--Gij beleedigt mij, dikzak.
--Toch niet, zeide Lamme, ik wil u vetmesten.
De wind waaide zachtjes, de zonne was warm; Lamme leed aan de koorts,
maar hij was stevig gebonden op zijn bed, opdat hij in zijne vlagen
van ijlhoofdigheid niet overboord zou vallen; doch hij waande zich
nog in de keuken en zei:
--Dat fornuis staat heel gereed. Aanstonds zal het ortolanen
regenen. Vrouw, span de strikken in onzen boomgaard. Zoo zijt
gij schoon, met uwe mouwen opgestroopt tot aan uwe ellebogen. Uw
arm is wit, ik wil er in bijten, bijten met mijne lippen, dewelke
fluweelen tanden zijn. Wien hoort dat schoon vleesch, die prachtige
boezem, dien ik zie dwars door uw wit, fijnlinnen jakje? Die
zoete schat is mijn! Wie zal de stoverije maken van hanekammetjes
en kiekenstuiten? Niet te veel muskaatnoot, daarvan krijgt men
koorts. Witte saus, tijm en laurier. Waar zijn de eierdooiers?
Vervolgens wenkte hij Uilenspiegel tot zich en zeide:
--Straks zal het wild regenen: ik zal u vier ortolanen meer geven
dan aan de anderen. Gij zijt de gezagvoerder, maar verraad mij niet!
Toen hij de golven zachtjes tegen den wand van het schip hoorde
klotsen, sprak hij verder:
--De soep kookt, mijn zoon, de soep kookt, maar met dat fornuis kan
ik geen vuur krijgen.
Zoodra hij weer tot zijne zinnen kwam, vroeg hij naar den monnik.
--Waar is hij? Vet hij aan?
En als zijn blik op hem viel, stak hij zijne tong naar hem uit,
zeggende:
--Het groote werk wordt voltooid.
Eens vroeg hij, dat men de groote waag op het dek zou brengen,
dat men hem zelven op een schaal zou zetten en den monnik op de
andere. Nauwelijks was de monnik erop, of Lamme steeg omhoog lijk
een vuurpijl in de lucht en, hem vreugdevol beziende, zeide hij:
--Hij is zwaarder! hij is zwaarder! ik ben licht als een geest tegen
hem: ik wil als een vogel de lucht klieven; ik heb mijn plan: neemt
er hem af, dat ik beneden kunne; legt er nu de gewichten op: zet hem
weder op de schaal. Hoeveel weegt hij? Driehonderd veertien pond. En
ik? Tweehonderd twintig!
VII.
In den nacht van den volgenden dag, bij de eerste ochtendschemering,
werd Uilenspiegel gewekt door Lamme, die schreeuwde:
--Uilenspiegel! Uilenspiegel! help, laat heur niet vertrekken. Snijd
de koorden door! snijd ze door!
Uilenspiegel klom op het dek en vroeg:
--Waarom roept gij? ik zie niets.
--Zij is 't, antwoordde Lamme, zij is 't, mijne vrouw, daar in die
sloep, welke de vlieboot omvaart; ja, om de vlieboot, van welke die
zangen en die vedeltonen kwamen.
Nele was ook op het dek geklommen.
--Snijd de koorden door, mijne vriendin, zei Lamme. Ziet gij niet,
dat mijne wond genezen is? Heur zachte hand heeft ze verbonden; zij,
ja, zij. Ziet gij ze rechtstaan in de sloep? Hoort gij? Zij zingt
nog. Kom, mijne liefste, kom, ontvlucht uwen armen Lamme niet meer,
die zonder u zoo moederziel alleen was op de wereld.
Nele nam zijne hand vast en legde de heure op zijn voorhoofd.
--Hij heeft nog koorts, sprak zij.
--Snijdt de koorden door, zei Lamme; geeft mij eene sloep! Ik ben
levend, ik ben gelukkig, ik ben genezen!
Uilenspiegel sneed de koorden door: Lamme sprong in zijn wit linnen
hooze, zonder wambuis, uit zijn bed, en wilde zelf de sloep in
zee laten.
--Zie hem bezig, zeide Nele tot Uilenspiegel: zijne handen beven
van ongeduld.
Toen de sloep gereed was, daalden Uilenspiegel, Nele en Lamme er in
met eenen roeier, en deze wriggelde naar de vlieboot, die, verre in
de reede, op anker lag.
--Zie, wat schoone vlieboot, zeide Lamme, die weldra, uit ongeduld,
de plaats van den roeier ingenomen had.
De romp en de masten van de vlieboot kwamen slank uit op den frisschen
morgenhemel, die, als verguld kristal, gekleurd werd door de rijzende
zonne.
Terwijl Lamme dapper doorwrikte, vroeg Uilenspiegel hem:
--Zeg ons nu hoe gij ze terugvondt.
Lamme antwoordde met horten en stooten:
--Ik sliep, reeds aan de beterzijde. Eensklaps dof gerucht. Stuk hout
klopt op het schip. Sloep! Op het gerucht een matroos toegeloopen:
Wie daar? Een zoete stem, de heure, mijn zoon, de heure antwoordt:
"Vrienden". Vervolgens grovere stem: "Vive le Geus: bevelhebber van
vlieboot Johanna moet Lamme Goedzak spreken". Matroos laat de ladder
beneden. De maan glom. Ik zie mannelijke gedaante op het dek klimmen:
breede heupen, ronde knieën, breed bekken; vrouw, maar geen man, zei
ik bij mij zelven: ik voel als eene roos die ontluikt en mijne kaak
streelt: heure lippen, mijn zoon, en ik hoor heur zeggen, begrijpt
gij? zij zelve, mij met kussen en tranen bedekkend--vloeibaar vuur,
dat als balsem nederviel op mijn gelaat--zij zelve zeide mij: "Ik weet,
dat ik misdoe, maar ik bemin u, mijn man! Ik heb voor God gezworen: ik
verbreek mijnen eed, mijn man, mijn arme man! dikwijls ben ik gekomen
zonder u te durven naderen; eindelijk stond de matroos het mij toe:
ik verbond uwe wond, gij herkendet mij niet; maar ik heb u genezen,
wees niet grammoedig, man! Ik ben u gevolgd, maar ik ben bevreesd,
hij is op dit schip: laat mij vertrekken; zoo hij mij zag, zou hij mij
verdoemen en zou ik branden in het eeuwige vuur!" Zij kuste mij nog,
weenend en gelukkig, en vertrok, mijns ondanks, in spijt van mijne
tranen: gij hadt mijne armen en beenen gebonden, mijn zoon, maar nu....
Dit zeggende, gaf hij krachtdadige riemslagen; het was als de gespannen
koord van eenen boog, die den pijl in de lucht schiet.
Naarmate zij de vlieboot naderden, zeide Lamme:
--Daar staat zij op het dek, zij speelt op de vedel, mijn beminnelijke
vrouw, met heur goudbruine lokken, heur bruine oogen, heur frissche
koonen, heur bloote, ronde armen, heur witte handjes. Vlieg over den
vloed, sloep!
Toen de kapitein van de vlieboot de sloep zag naderen en Lamme als een
duivel wriggelen, liet hij eene ladder uitwerpen. Toen Lamme er dicht
bij was, sprong hij van de sloep op de ladder, op gevaar af van in
zee te vallen, zoodat de sloep meer dan drie vademen achteruit gleed;
en, vlug als eene kat op het dek klaverend, liep hij naar zijne vrouw,
die, buiten zich zelve van geluk, hem kuste en omhelsde, en zeide:
--Lamme! breng mij niet ten verderve; ik heb voor God gezworen,
maar ik bemin u. Ha! lieve man!
Nele riep:
--'t Is Kalleken Huybrechts, het schoone Kalleken!
--Ik ben het, sprak zij, ja, Kalleken, maar schoon is ze niet meer!
En zij zette een jammerlijk gezicht.
--Wat hebt gij gedaan, vroeg Lamme, wat zijt gij geworden? waarom
liet ge mij zitten? waarom wilt gij mij weder verlaten?
--Luister, zeide zij, wees niet grammoedig, ik zal u alles bekennen:
wetende dat al de monniken mannen Gods zijn, vertrouwde ik mij aan
een hunner; hij heet broer Cornelis Adriaensen.
Toen Lamme dit hoorde, riep hij uit:
--Wat, die smerige paap, wiens mond een rioolgat was, vol drek en vol
modder, en die steeds dorstte naar het bloed der hervormden! Wat! die
verdediger der brandstapels en der plakkaten! Ha! 't was die gemeene
schavuit!
Kalleken sprak:
--Laster den man Gods niet!
--De man Gods! zeide Lamme, ik ken hem: het was de man van vuilnis en
vuigheid. Wat rampspoed! mijn schoon Kalleken gevallen in de handen
van dien ontuchtigen vuilbaard! Nader mij niet, of ik dood u; en ik,
die heur zoozeer beminde! mijn arm bedrogen hert, dat ganschelijk
heur was! Wat komt gij hier doen op onze schepen? waarom hebt gij mij
opgepast? waarom liet ge mij niet sterven? Ga heen, ik wil u voor mijne
oogen niet meer zien; ga heen, of ik smijt u in de zee. Mijn mes!...
Doch zij vloog om zijnen hals en sprak:
--Lamme, mijn man, ween niet: ik ben niet wat gij denkt: ik behoorde
nooit aan dien monnik.
--Gij liegt, zeide Lamme weenend en knarsetandend tegelijk. Ha! nooit
was ik jaloersch, doch nu ben ik het! Ongelukkige drift, grammoedigheid
en liefde, behoefte aan dooden en worgen. Uit mijne oogen! neen,
blijf! Ik was zoo goed voor heur! De moordlust is meester in mij. Mijn
mes! Ho! hier brandt, verteert, knaagt iets in mij; gij spot met
mij....
Zoet en onderdanig, omhelsde zij hem weenend.
--Ja, zeide hij, ik ben belachelijk met mijne gramschap: ja, gij
bewaardet mijne eer, die eer, die men dwaselijk hangt aan den rok
eener vrouw. Daarom was het dus, dat gij uw zoetste lonkjes koost om
mij te vragen of gij met uwe vriendinnen naar het sermoen mocht gaan?
--Laat mij spreken, zei de vrouw hem omhelzend: ik mag op staanden
voet doodvallen, zoo ik u ooit bedroog.
--Wel, val dan dood, zeide Lamme, want gij gaat liegen!
--Luister, zeide zij.
--Spreek of zwijg, sprak Lamme, 't is mij eender.
--Broer Adriaensen, zeide zij, ging door voor een bespraakt predikant;
hij stelde den geestelijken en den ongehuwden staat verre boven
den anderen, als best geschikt om de geloovigen in het hemelrijk te
brengen; zijne welsprekendheid was groot en onstuimig: daardoor bracht
hij het verstand op hol van meerdere eerlijke vrouwen, onder dewelke
ik telde, en ook van een groot aantal weduwen en meidekens. Vermits
de ongehuwde staat zoo volmaakt was, bezwoer hij ons in denzelven te
blijven: wij zwoeren, dat wij ons nimmermeer zouden laten trouwen....
--Behalve door hem ... zei Lamme weenend.
--Zwijg toch, zeide zij grammoedig.
--Komaan, sprak hij, voltooi uw werk: gij hebt mij een harden slag
toegebracht, ik zal hem niet overleven.
--'t Doet, zeide zij, zoo ik altijd bij u blijf, man.
Zij wilde hem omhelzen en kussen, maar hij stiet heur van zich af.
--De weduwen, zeide zij, zwoeren vóór hem, nooit te zullen hertrouwen.
En Lamme aanhoorde heur, gedachteloos in zijn jaloersche droomerij.
Kalleken vervolgde, beschaamd, heure rede:
--Hij wilde, zeide zij, geen andere biechtelingen dan jonge en schoone
vrouwen of meidekens: de anderen stuurde hij naar den paap heurer
parochie. Hij stelde eene orde van godvruchtige vrouwen in, en deed
ons allen zweren niemand anders tot biechtvader te zullen nemen dan
hem: dat zwoer ik; mijne gezellinnen, beter onderricht dan ik, vroegen
mij of ik mij wilde laten onderwijzen in de Heilige Geeseling en in de
Heilige Boete: ik stemde toe. Er was te Brugge, op de Steenkappersrei,
omtrent het Minderbroedersklooster, een huis bewoond door eene vrouw,
genoemd Kalle de Naeyer, welke aan de meidekens kost en onderricht
gaf, tegen een karolusgulden per maand: Broer Cornelis kon bij Kalle
de Naeyer binnen, zonder oogenschijnlijk uit zijn klooster te komen,
het was in dit huis dat ik ging, in een kleine kamer, in dewelke hij
zich alleen bevond; daar gebood hij mij, hem al mijn natuurlijke en
vleeschelijke neigingen te zeggen; eerst durfde ik niet, maar ten
slotte gaf ik toe: ik weende en zeide hem alles.
--Laas! schreide Lamme, en alzoo ontving die zwijnachtige monnik uw
zoete biechte!
--Hij zeide mij steeds, en dit is waar, mijn man, dat er boven de
aardsche eerbaarheid een hemelsche eerbaarheid bestaat, door dewelke
wij God onze wereldsche schaamte offeren, en dat wij aldus aan onzen
biechtvader al onze geheime lusten moeten bekennen, en dan weerdig
zijn de Heilige Geeseling en de Heilige Boete te ontvangen.
Eindelijk beval hij mij, naakt vóór hem te gaan staan, om op mijn
lichaam, dat gezondigd had, de al te lichte kastijding mijner schulden
te ontvangen. Eens gebood hij mij, mij te ontkleeden; ik viel in
onmacht toen ik mijn hemde moest uitdoen: hij bracht mij weer tot
mij zelve, door middel van fleschjes.--"'t Is goed voor deze reize,
mijne dochter, sprak hij, kom binnen twee dagen terug en breng eene
roede mee". Dit duurde lang, zonder dat hij ooit ... ik zweer het
voor God en al zijne santen ... mijn man ... begrijp mij ... kijk
naar mij ... zie of ik lieg: ik bleef zuiver en trouw ... ik beminde u.
--Arm zoet lichaam, zeide Lamme. O, vlek van schande op uw bruidskleed!
--Lamme, zeide zij, hij sprak in den naam Gods en onzer Moeder,
de Heilige Kerk; moest ik hem niet aanhooren? Ik beminde u steeds,
maar door schromelijke eeden had ik de Maagd gezworen mij aan u te
onttrekken; ik was nochtans zwak voor u, Lamme. Herinnert gij u nog het
gasthof te Brugge? Ik was bij Kalle de Naeyer, gij reedt daar voorbij
op uwen ezel, met Uilenspiegel. Ik volgde u; ik had een schoone som
gelds op zak, want ik verteerde niets voor mij zelve; ik zag, dat
gij honger hadt: mijn hert trok naar u, ik had medelijden en liefde!
--Waar is hij nu? vroeg Uilenspiegel.
Kalleken antwoordde:
--Na een onderzoek, bevolen door den magistraat, en eene nasporing
van de boozen, moest broer Adriaensen de stede Brugge verlaten,
en hij nam de wijk naar Antwerpen. Op de vlieboot zeide men mij,
dat mijn man hem gevangen nam.
--Wat! riep Lamme, die monnik dien ik vetmest, is....
--Hij zelf, antwoordde Kalleken, terwijl zij heur aangezicht met
heure handen bedekte.
--Eene akst! eene akst! zeide Lamme, dat ik hem doode, dat ik het
vet van dien geilen bok bij opbod verkoope! Gauw, laat ons naar het
schip terugkeeren. De sloep! Waar is de sloep?
Nele sprak:
--Het is een eerlooze wreedheid eenen gevangene te dooden of te
kwetsen.
--Gij beziet mij zoo verschrikkelijk, zeide hij, zoudt gij het mij
beletten?
--Ja, zeide zij.
--Wel, sprak Lamme, ik zal hem geenerlei leed doen: laat mij hem
slechts uit zijne kooi trekken. De sloep! Waar is de sloep?
Zij stapten weldra in de sloep. Lamme wrikte zoo vlug als hij kon en
schreide tegelijk.
--Zijt gij droef, man? vroeg Kalleken hem.
--Neen, zeide hij, ik ben gelukkig: zult ge mij niet meer verlaten?
--Nooit! zeide zij.
--Gij waart zuiver en trouw, zegt gij; maar, zoet, lief Kalleken,
ik leefde enkel om u weder te vinden, en nu zal, door de schuld van
dien monnik, ons geluk vergiftigd zijn door jaloerschheid.... Zoodra
ik droef zal wezen of enkellijk moede, zal ik u in verbeelding
naakt zien, uw schoon lichaam onderwerpende aan die schandelijke
geeseling. De lente onzer liefde was aan mij, doch de zomer aan hem;
de herfst zal grauw zijn; weldra komt de winter en die zal mijn trouwe
liefde begraven.
--Gij weent, zeide zij.
--Ja, sprak hij, wat voorbij is, komt nimmer terug.
Toen zei Nele:
--Als Kalleken trouw was, moest zij u weer alleen laten om uw leelijke
woorden.
--Hij weet niet hoezeer ik hem altoos beminde, zei Kalleken.
--Zegt gij de waarheid? riep Lamme uit; kom, liefste, kom, mijne vrouw;
geen grauwe herfst, en geen winter des doods meer!
En hij zag er blijde uit, en zij kwamen op het schip.
Uilenspiegel gaf de sleutels van de kooi aan Lamme, die deze opende;
hij wilde den monnik bij een oor op het dek trekken, maar het ging
niet; toen wilde hij hem zijdelings doen buitenkomen, maar het ging
ook niet.
Wij moeten het kot uitbreken; de kapoen is gemest, zeide hij.
De monnik kwam er toen uit, keek met groote, verdwaasde oogen in
het rond, hield met de beide handen zijn buik op, en viel op zijn
achterste, ter oorzake van een hevige baar, die het schip ophief.
En Lamme zei tot den monnik:
--Zult ge mij nog dikzak heeten? gij zijt dikker dan ik! Wie diende
u zeven eetmalen daags vóór? Ik! Hoe komt het, schreeuwer, dat gij
nu zachtmoediger zijt jegens de arme Geuzen?
En, zijne rede vervolgend:
--Als gij nog een jaar in uwe kooi blijft, kunt gij er niet meer uit:
bij de minste beweging lillen uwe kaken als verkensgelei; gij schreeuwt
al niet meer; weldra zult gij niet meer kunnen blazen.
--Zwijg, dikzak, zeide de monnik.
--Dikzak, zei Lamme, in woede ontstekend, ik ben Lamme Goedzak;
gij zijt broer Dikzak, Vetzak, Slokzak, Leugenzak, Modderzak; gij
hebt vier duim spek onder uw vel; men ziet uwe oogen niet meer;
Uilenspiegel en ik zouden, op ons gemak, huizen in uwen buik, die
groot is als eene kerk. Gij heet mij dikzak, wilt gij eenen spiegel
om Uwe Dikbuikigheid te bewonderen? Ik ben het, die u voed, gevaarte
van vleesch en been. Ik heb gezworen, dat gij vet zult spuwen, dat
gij vet zult zweeten, dat gij sporen van vet achter u zult nalaten,
als eene keers, die smelt in de zonne. Men zei mij, dat de geraaktheid
komt met de zevende kin: de zesde is in aantocht!
Vervolgens wendde hij zich tot de Geuzen:
--Aanschouwt dien hoereerder! sprak hij. Het is broer Cornelis
Adriaensen, van Brugge: dáár preekte hij een nieuwe eerbaarheid. Zijn
vet is zijne straf, en zijne straf is mijn werk. Nu, luistert,
gij allen, matrozen en soldaten: ik ga u verlaten, u verlaten,
Uilenspiegel, u verlaten, u ook, kleine Nele, om naar Vlissingen
te tiegen, alwaar ik eenig goed bezit, en er te leven met mijn arme
wedergevondene vrouw. Vroeger zwoert gij, mij alles toe te staan wat
ik zou vragen....
--Dat is Geuzenwoord zeiden zij.
--Dus, zeide Lamme, aanschouwt dien hoereerder, dien broer Adriaensen,
Vetlap-aensen van Bruggen; ik zwoer hem te doen sterven in zijn vet
als een zwijn; maakt hem een grootere kooi, doet hem met geweld twaalf
eetmalen daags verorberen in stede van zeven; geeft hem vetten en
gesuikerden kost; hij lijkt reeds een os, maakt er een olifant van,
en weldra zult gij hem de hoeken zijner kooi zien vullen.
--Wij zullen hem voortmesten, zeiden zij.
--En nu, vervolgde Lamme, tot den monnik sprekend, u ook, rabauw,
dien ik doe voeden op kloosterwijs, in stee van u te doen hangen,
u ook zeg ik vaarwel: en leef op hoop van vet en van geraaktheid!
Vervolgens zijne vrouw, zijn Kalleken, in de armen drukkend, voegde
hij er bij:
--Kijk, gij moogt knorren of balken, maar ik neem ze mee, gij zult
ze niet langer geeselen!
Maar de monnik, in woede ontstoken, zeide tot Kalleken:
--Gij keert dus terug naar uw leger van wellust, o zinnelijke
vrouwe! Ja, gij gaat henen zonder mededoogen met den armen martelaar
voor Gods woord, die u de heilige, zoete en hemelsche geeseling
leerde. Wees gedoemd! Nooit schenke een priester u vergiffenis;
de grond brande onder uwe voeten; suiker weze u zout; ossevleesch
weze u kroengevleesch; brood weze u assche; de zonne weze u ijs,
en sneeuw een hellevuur; de vrucht uws lichaams weze gevloekt;
uwe kinderen wezen afschuwelijk: met de leden van een aap, een
verkenshoofd grooter dan hun buik; lijden, weenen, zuchten weze uw lot
in deze wereld en in de andere, in de helle die u wacht, de helle van
zwavel en pik, die branden voor de wijven van uw slag; gij weigerdet
mijn vaderlijke liefde: wees driemaal vermaledijd door de heilige
Drievuldigheid; zevenmaal vermaledijd door de kandeleers der Ark;
de biecht weze u verdoemenis; de hostie weze u doodelijk venijn; en,
in de kerken, richte elke vloersteen zich op om u te verpletteren en
u te zeggen: "Hier is de hoereerster; hier is de verdoemde; hier is
de vermaledijde!"
En Lamme sprong op van geluk en riep blijde uit:
--Zij was trouw, de monnik heeft het gezegd! Leve Kalleken!
Doch zij, weenend en sidderend, zeide:
--O, Lamme, neem die verdoemenis over mij weg! Ik zie de helle! Neem
de verdoemenis weg!
--Monnik, trek de verdoemenis in, gebood Lamme.
--Ik zal het niet doen, dikzak, antwoordde de monnik.
En de vrouw, bleek en sidderend, viel op de knieën en smeekte broer
Adriaensen met de handen te zamen.
En Lamme zei tot den monnik:
--Trek de verdoemenis in of gij wordt gehangen: en, breekt de koorde,
uit hoofde van uwe zwaarte, zoo wordt gij herhangen, totdat de dood
er op volge.
--Gehangen en herhangen! zeiden de Geuzen.
--Als het zoo is, zei de monnik tot Kalleken, ga dan, ontuchtige
vrouwe; ga dan met dien dikzak; ga, ik hef mijne verdoemenis op, maar
God en al zijne santen houden u in het oog: ga met dien dikzak, ga!
En hij zweeg, blazend en zweetend.
Plotseling riep Lamme uit:
--Hij zwelt op, hij zwelt op! Daar is de zesde kin: de zevende kin
is de geraaktheid!
... En nu, zeide hij tot de Geuzen, ik beveel u aan God, u,
Uilenspiegel aan God, u allen, mijn goede vrienden, aan God, Nele
mijne vriendin, aan God, de heilige zaak van de vrijheid: ik kan
niets meer voor haar....
Vervolgens, als hij iedereen omhelsd had, zeide hij tot zijne vrouw
Kalleken:
--Kom, het is het uur van onze wettige liefde.
Terwijl het bootje, dat Lamme en zijne welbeminde meevoerde, over
het water gleed, riepen al de matrozen, soldaten en scheepsjongens
met hunnen hoed zwaaiend:
--Vaarwel, broeder; vaarwel, Lamme; vaarwel, broeder, broeder en
vriend!
En Nele wischte met heur liefelijken vinger eenen traan uit het oog
van Uilenspiegel en zeide tot hem:
--Gij zijt droef, mijn vriend?
--Hij was goed, zeide hij.
--Ha! zeide zij, zal die oorlog dan nooit een einde nemen, zullen
wij dan immer gedwongen zijn te leven in bloed en in tranen?
--Laat ons de Zeven zoeken, antwoordde Uilenspiegel: het is nakend,
het uur der verlossing....
Volgens de belofte, die zij aan Lamme gedaan hadden, mestten de
Geuzen den monnik voort in zijne kooi. Doch op zekeren dag werden
zij het moede, en ze stelden hem in vrijheid tegen een rantsoen bij
't gewicht; en hij bracht een mooien stuiver op, want hij woog toen
driehonderd zeventien pond en vijf onsen, Vlaamsch gewicht.
En hij stierf als prior van zijn convent.
VIII.
Te dien tijde vergaderden de heeren van de Staten-Generaal te
's-Gravenhage, om Philippus, koning van Spanje, grave van Vlaanderen,
van Holland enz., te oordeelen naarvolgens de door hem verleende
charters en privileges.
En de griffier sprak als volgt:
--Het is een iegelijk bekend, dat een landvorst aangesteld is door
God, als souverein en hoofd zijner onderdanen, om ze te verdedigen
en te vrijwaren van alle beleediging, verdrukking en geweld, evenals
een herder aangesteld is voor de verdediging en de hoede zijner
kudde. Het is mede algemeen bekend, dat de onderdanen geenszins door
God geschapen zijn ten gerieve des prinsen, om hem gehoorzaam te wezen
in alles wat hij zou heeten, hetzij dat het vroom is of goddeloos,
rechtveerdig of onrechtveerdig, noch om denzelven te dienen als
slaven. Maar de vorst is vorst ten behoeve van zijne onderdanen,
zonder dewelke hij niet kan wezen, om naar recht en rede te bestieren;
om ze te behouden en te beminnen als een vader zijne kinderen, als
een herder zijn kudde, en zijn leven te wagen om ze te verdedigen;
doet hij het niet, zoo moet hij aanzien worden, niet voor eenen
vorst, maar voor eenen dwingeland. Door oproeping van soldaten,
door bullen van kruistocht en van kerkban, zond Philippus koning,
vier uitheemsche legers af tegen ons. Welke zal zijne straf wezen,
overeenkomstig de wetten en costumen van den lande?
--Hij weze vervallen, antwoordden de heeren der Staten.
--Philippus heeft zijne eeden verbroken; hij vergat de diensten, welke
wij hem bewezen, de zegepralen, welke wij hem hielpen behalen. Toen
hij zag, dat wij rijk waren, liet hij ons afzetten en bestelen door
die van den raad van Spanje.
--Hij weze vervallen als ondankbare en dief, antwoordden de heeren
der Staten.
--Philippus, vervolgde de griffier, stelde in de machtigste steden
des lands bisschoppen aan, begiftigde en bevoordeelde dezelven met
de goedingen der grootste abdijen; door de hulp van dezelven, bracht
hij de Spaansche Inquisitie in onze landen.
--Hij weze vervallen als beul, verkwister van eens andermans goeding,
antwoordden de heeren der Staten.
--Ten aanzien van de dwingelandij, vertoonden de edelen van de landen
ten jare 1566 een verzoekschrift, bij hetwelk zij den souvereinen
vorst smeekten zijn strenge plakkaten te verzachten en namelijk die
op het stuk der inquisitie: hij weigerde steeds.
--Hij weze vervallen als een tijger, die hardnekkig is in de wreedheid,
antwoordden de heeren der Staten.
De griffier vervolgde:
--Philippus wordt ernstig verdacht van, door die van zijnen raad
van Spanje, heimelijk den beeldenstorm en de plundering der kerken
te hebben bewerkt, ten einde, onder voorwendsel van misdaad en
wanordelijkheden, vreemde legers tegen ons te kunnen afzenden.
--Hij weze vervallen als een werktuig des doods, antwoordden de heeren
der Staten.
--Te Antwerpen deed Philippus de inwoneren slachten, en de Vlaamsche
en vreemde kooplieden ten onder brengen. Hij en zijn raad van
Spanje gaven, door heimelijke onderrichtingen, aan zekeren Roda,
een beruchten rabauw, het recht zich hoofdman der plunderaars te
verklaren, den buit op te garen, zijn naam, van hem, Philippus koning,
te gebruiken, zijne zegelen na te maken en zich te gedragen als zijn
landvoogd en stedehouder. De onderschepte koninklijke brieven, welke
zich in onze handen bevinden, bewijzen het stuk. Alles is gebeurd
met zijne toestemming en na overleg met den raad van Spanje. Leest
zijne brieven: daarin looft hij het feit van Antwerpen, bekent hij een
uitstekenden dienst ontvangen te hebben, belooft hij dien te zullen
beloonen, zet hij Roda en de andere Spanjaards aan, voort te gaan op
dien roemvollen weg.
--Hij weze vervallen als dief, als plunderaar, als moordenaar,
antwoordden de heeren der Staten.
--Wij willen slechts het behoud van onze privileges, een eerlijken
en verzekerden vrede, meer vrijheid, namelijk op het stuk van den
godsdienst, welke hoofdzakelijk eene gewetenszaak is: van Philippus
kregen wij niets dan leugenachtige verdragen, welke tweedracht
moesten zaaien onder de provinciën, om ze de eene na de andere te
onderwerpen en met haar te handelen als met Indië, door plundering,
verbeurdverklaring, terdoodbrenging en inquisitie.
--Hij weze vervallen als moordenaar, die den moord van de landen
beraamt, antwoordden de heeren der Staten.
--Hij deed de landen bloeden door den hertog van Alva en zijne
trawanten, door Medina Celi, Requesens, de judassen der raden van
State en van de provinciën; don Juan en Alexander Farnese beval hij
met ongemeene en bloedige strengheid te werk te gaan (zooals weer
blijkt uit zijne onderschepte brieven); hij sloeg in den rijksban Prins
Willem van Oranje, betaalde drie moordenaars, in afwachting dat hij den
vierden betaalt; deed in de landen kasteelen en vestingen oprichten,
deed de mannen levend verbranden, de vrouwlieden en meidekens levend
begraven; erfde hunne goedingen, verworgde Montigny, Bergen en andere
heeren, in weerwil van zijn koninklijk woord; hij doodde zijn zoon
Carlos; vergiftigde prins Ascoly, dien hij deed trouwen met dona
Eufrasia, dewelke door hem was bezwangerd, ten einde den bastaard,
die moest geboren worden, met zijne goederen te verrijken; veerdigde
tegen ons een edict uit, hetwelk ons allen verraders verklaarde, ons
lijf en goed ontnemend, en bedreef die in een kersten land ongekende
misdaad, geen onderscheid te maken tusschen schuldigen en onschuldigen.
--Uit hoofde van alle wetten, rechten en privilegiën, weze hij
vervallen, antwoordden de heeren der Staten.
En de zegels des konings werden gebroken.
En de zonne gloorde over land en zee, verguldde de gezwollen korenaren,
rijpte de druiven en strooide op elke baar van de zee flikkerende
perelen, het sieraad van Neerlands bruid: de Vrijheid.
Vervolgens werd de Prins, te Delft zijnde, door een vierden moordenaar
met drie kogels in de borst getroffen. En hij stierf, volgens zijne
spreuk: "Rustig onder de wreede baren".
Zijne vijanden zeiden van hem, dat hij, om koning Philippus te
bestoken, en daar hij toch niet hoopte over de zuidelijke, katholieke
Nederlanden te regeeren, deze bij geheim verdrag aangeboden had aan
monseigneur Zijne Groote Hoogheid van Anjou. Doch deze was geenszins
geboren om de telg Belgieland te verwekken bij de Vrijheid, dewelke
niet houdt van buitensporige minnarijen.
En Uilenspiegel verliet met Nele de vloot.
En het Belgische vaderland zuchtte onder het juk, geworgd, gekneveld
door de verraders.
IX.
Toen was men in de maand van het rijpe koren; de lucht was drukkend,
de wind zoel: onder den vrijen hemel, op een vrijen grond, konden
maaiers en pikkers in de akkers vrijelijk het koren oogsten, dat zij
gezaaid hadden.
Friesland, Drente, Overijsel, Gelderland, Utrecht, Noord-Brabant,
Noord- en Zuid-Holland; Walcheren, Noord- en Zuid-Beveland, Duiveland
en Schouwen, welke Zeeland uitmaken; heel de kust der Noordzee,
van Knokke tot den Helder; de eilanden Texel, Vlieland, Ameland,
Schiermonnikoog zouden, van de Wester-schelde tot de Ooster-Eems,
het Spaansche juk afschudden; Maurits, zoon van den Zwijger, zette
den oorlog voort.
Nog ten volle in het bezit van hunne jeugd, hunne kracht en hunne
schoonheid,--want de liefde en de geest van Vlaanderen blijven immer
jong,--leefden Uilenspiegel en Nele rustig in den toren van Veere,
in afwachting, dat, na menigvuldige wreede beproevingen, de wind der
vrijheid over het Belgische vaderland zou waaien.
Uilenspiegel had gevraagd om bevelhebber en wachter van den toren
te worden benoemd, aanvoerende, dat hij, met zijne arendsoogen en
hazenooren, zou kunnen zien en hooren of de Spanjaard het soms niet
beproefde terug te komen naar de verloste landen en dat hij alsdan
wacharm zou luiden.
De magistraat deed wat hij vroeg: om den wille van zijn goede diensten,
gaf men hem een gulden daags, twee pinten bier, boonen, kaas, beschuit,
alsmede drie pond vleesch in de week.
Aldus leefden Uilenspiegel en Nele getweeën heel goed; van verre zagen
zij met vreugde de vrije Zeeuwsche eilanden: weiden en bosschen,
kasteelen en vestingen, en de gewapende schepen der Geuzen, die de
kusten bewaakten.
's Nachts klommen zij zeer dikwijls omhoog op den toren en, daar naast
elkander gezeten, koutten zij over de harde gevechten, de schoone
minnarijen van het verleden en ook van de toekomst. Van daar zagen zij
de zee, welker lichtende golven zich braken en in schuim uiteenspatten,
en als vurige spoken op de eilanden vielen. En Nele was verschrikt
als zij in de polders dwaallichtjes zag, welke, zeide zij, zielen
van arme dooden zijn. En al deze plaatsen waren slagvelden geweest.
De dwaallichtjes stegen op uit de polders, huppelden langshenen
de dijken, keerden vervolgens terug naar de polders, alsof zij de
lichamen niet wilden verlaten, uit welke zij kwamen.
Op zekeren nacht zei Nele tot Uilenspiegel:
--Zie hoe talrijk zij zijn in Beveland, en hoe hoog zij zweven in de
lucht: langs den kant van de vogeleilanden zie ik er het meest. Wilt
gij medekomen, Thijl? wij zullen ons strijken met de zalve, welke
dingen toont, die onzichtbaar zijn voor de oogen der stervelingen.
Uilenspiegel antwoordde:
--Als 't die zalve is, die mij naar den grooten sabbat bracht, heb
ik er geen vertrouwen meer in.
--Loochen de kracht der tooverije niet. Kom mee, Uilenspiegel.
's Anderen daags vroeg hij aan den magistraat, dat een trouw en
scherpziend soldaat hem zou vervangen om den toren te wachten en te
waken over het land.
En hij toog henen met Nele naar de vogeleilanden.
Terwijl zij stapten langs akkers en dijken, zagen zij kleine
groene eilandjes, tusschen dewelke het zeewater stroomde, en, op de
begraasde heuvelen, die zich tot het duin uitstrekten, een groote
menigte kieviten, meeuwen en zeezwaluwen, die onbeweeglijk zaten
en met hunne ruggen witte eilandjes uitmaakten; daarboven vlogen
duizenden van die vogelen. De grond was vol nesten: Uilenspiegel,
die zich bukte om een ei van den weg op te rapen, zag eene meeuw
fladderend naar hem komen en een grooten schreeuw slaken. Op dien
kreet kwamen meer dan honderd andere bij, die schreeuwden van angst
en boven het hoofd van Uilenspiegel en de naburige nesten vlogen,
doch zij durfden hem niet naderen.
--Uilenspiegel, zeide Nele, die vogelen vragen genade voor hunne
eieren.
Vervolgens begon zij te beven, en zij zeide:
--Ik ben bang, de zonne gaat onder, de hemel is wit, de sterren
ontwaken, dit is het uur van de geesten. Zie, die roode uitwasemingen
rakelings zweven langs den grond; Thijl, mijn beminde, wie is
het helsche monster, dat aldus in de wolken zijn vurigen muil open
doet? Zie, langs den kant van Philips-land, waar de koninklijke beul,
uit wreedaardige heerschzucht, tweemaal achtereen zooveel arme menschen
liet dooden, zie die dwaallichtjes dansen; 't is de nacht in denwelken
de zielen der arme mannen, die gedood werden in de gevechten, het
koude voorgeborchte des vagevuurs verlaten, om zich te komen warmen
in de zoele lucht van de aarde: dit is het uur, waarop gij alles
moogt vragen aan Christus, welke de God van de goede tooveraars is.
--De assche klopt op mijn hert, zeide Uilenspiegel. Kon Christus maar
die Zeven toonen, wier in den wind gesmeten assche ons Vlaanderen en
heel de wereld gelukkig zou maken.
--Ongeloovige, zeide Nele, gij zult ze zien met de zalve.
--Misschien, als een geest wil nederdalen uit de koude sterre, zei
Uilenspiegel, met den vinger naar Sirius wijzend.
Bij dat gebaar hechtte een dwaallichtje, dat rondom hem fladderde,
zich vast aan zijn vinger, en hoe meer hij het los wilde maken,
hoe vaster het er aan bleef gehecht.
Doch terwijl Nele beproefde Uilenspiegel los te maken, kreeg zij ook
haar dwaallichtje aan de toppen heurer vingeren.
Uilenspiegel sloeg op het zijne en sprak:
--Antwoord! zijt gij de ziel van eenen Geus of van eenen Spanjool? Zijt
gij de ziel van eenen Geus, ga dan naar het hemelrijk; zijt gij die
van eenen Spanjool, keer terug naar de helle, die u braakte.
Nele zeide hem:
--Beleedig nooit de zielen, al waren het zielen van beulen.
En, terwijl zij heur dwaallichtje op den top van heuren vinger deed
dansen, zeide zij:
--Lichtje, liefelijk lichtje, welke miede brengt gij uit het land van
de zielen? Wat doen zij? Eten en drinken zij, hoewel zij geen mond
hebben? Want gij ook hebt er geen, bevallig lichtje! ofwel, nemen
zij slechts in het gezegende hemelrijk de menschelijke gedaante aan?
--Hoe kunt gij, sprak Uilenspiegel, aldus uwen tijd verliezen met
te spreken tot dat droef vlammetje, dat geene ooren heeft om u te
aanhooren, en geenen mond om u te woord te staan?
Maar zonder naar hem te luisteren;
--Lichtje, zeide Nele, antwoord al dansend, want ik ga u driemaal
ondervragen: eenmaal in den naam Gods, eenmaal in den naam der Heilige
Maagd, en eenmaal in den naam der sylphen, die de boden zijn tusschen
God en de menschen.
Zij deed het, en het lichtje danste drie keeren.
--Trek uwe kleederen uit; ik zal hetzelfde doen: hier is de zilveren
doos met de tooverzalve, zei Nele tot Uilenspiegel.
--'t Is mij eender, antwoordde Uilenspiegel.
Toen zij zich ontkleed en met zalve bestreken hadden, legden zij zich
naast elkander op het gras.
De meeuwen kloegen; de donder rammelde dof in het zwerk, waarin een
helle flits flikkerde; de wassende maan toonde tusschen twee vluchtige
wolken nauwelijks hare twee gulden horens; Nele's en Uilenspiegel's
dwaallichtjes gingen met de anderen dansen in den beemd.
Plotseling werden Nele en heur vriend gegrepen met de groote hand
van eenen reus, dewelke ze in de lucht smeet als sneeuwballen, ze
weder opving, ze tusschen zijne handen ineenrolde en kneedde met
zijne vingeren, ze smeet in de waddenplassen tusschen de duinen, en
ze er weder uittrok, vol zeewier. En terwijl de reus ze vervolgens
ronddroeg in het luchtruim, zong hij met eene stem, die al de meeuwen
der eilanden van schrik deed ontwaken:
    Lezen willen luizedwergen
    Met ziekelijk troebel oog,
    Wat wij zoo weigerlijk bergen:
    De teekenen heilig en hoog.
    Lelie, luis, het eerwaarde,
    Lelie, vloo, de geheimenis,
    Die in hemel, lucht en aarde
    Met zeven nagels vernageld is.
En inderdaad, Uilenspiegel en Nele zagen op het gras, in de lucht en
in den hemel, zeven lichtende koperen tafelen, bevestigd door middel
van zeven vlammende nagelen. Op de tafelen stond geschreven:
    Onder den mesthoop kiemt de plant.
    Is zeven slecht, zeven is goed.
    Kolen vormen diamant,
    Dwaze doctoren, leerlingen vroed.
    Is zeven slecht, zeven is goed.
En de reus stapte voort, gevolgd door al die dwaallichtjes, die,
gonzend als krekelen, zeiden:
    Kijkt toe wie de macht hier torst,
    Der pausen paus, der vorsten vorst;
    Wie Caesar aan den leiband houdt,
    Kijkt toe, hij is van hout!
Eensklaps veranderden zijne trekken, hij scheen magerder, treuriger,
grooter. In eene hand hield hij eenen schepter en in de andere een
zweerd. Hij hiet Hooveerdigheid.
En Nele en Uilenspiegel ten gronde smijtend, zeide hij:
--Ik ben God!
En daar kwam naast hem, op eenen ezel gezeten, een dikke, roodwangige
meid, nauwelijks gekleed, met bloote borsten, en wulpsche oogen:
zij heette Onkuischheid; vervolgens kwam een oude jodin, die schalen
van meeuweneieren opraapte: zij heette Gierigheid; dan een dikke,
vraatzuchtige monnik, die worsten verslond, zich volpropte met
pensen en gedurig mommelde als de zeug, op dewelke hij zat: het was
de Gulzigheid; vervolgens kwam de Traagheid, trekkebeenend, bleek
en opgezwollen, met doffe oogen, die de Gramschap met een prikstok
voor zich dreef. Jammerend en badend in tranen, viel de Traagheid van
vermoeienis op heure knieën; vervolgens kwam de magere Nijd, met een
slangekop en hoektanden, die de Traagheid beet omdat zij te veel heur
gemak zocht, de Gramschap omdat zij te levendig was, de Gulzigheid
omdat zij te veel gegeten had, de Onkuischheid omdat zij te rood was,
de Gierigheid ter oorzake van de schalen, de Hooveerdigheid omdat
zij een purperen kleed en op het hoofd eene kroon droeg.
En de dwaallichtjes dansten rondom hen.
En, sprekend met stemmen als van kermende mannen, vrouwlieden,
meidekens en kinderen, zeiden zij zuchtend:
--Hooveerdigheid, bron van heerschzucht, Gramschap, moeder der
wreedheid, gij dooddet ons op slagveld, in gevangenis en door
marteling, om uwe schepters en kronen te behouden! Nijd, gij vernieldet
in hunne kiem velerlei edele en nuttige denkbeelden: wij zijn de zielen
van de verdrukte uitvinders; Gierigheid, gij veranderdet in goud,
het zweet en het bloed van het arme volk: wij zijn de geesten van
de zwoegers, uwe slachtofferen; Onkuischheid, gezellin en boelin van
den Moord, die samen Nero, Messalina en Philippus, koning van Spanje,
verwektet, gij koopt de deugd om en betaalt de verleiding; wij zijn de
zielen der dooden; Traagheid en Gulzigheid, gij bevuilt en onteert de
wereld: wij moeten u van haar verjagen, wij zijn de zielen der dooden.
En men hoorde eene stem zeggen:
    Onder den mesthoop kiemt de plant.
    Is zeven slecht, zeven is goed.
    Bij dwaze doctoren, leerlingen vroed;
    Om asch te krijgen en tevens kool
    Wat doet een vlooken op den dool?
En de dwaallichtjes zeiden:
--Wij zijn het vuur, de weerwraak van de oude tranen, de smerten van
het gemeen; de weerwraak op de heeren, die joegen op menschelijk wild;
de weerwraak van de onnutte gevechten, van het in de gevangenissen
vergoten bloed, van de levend verbrande mannen, de levend begraven
vrouwlieden en meidekens; de weerwraak van het akelig en bloedig
verleden. Wij zijn het vuur, wij zijn de zielen der dooden!
Bij die woorden werden de Zeven veranderd in houten standbeelden,
waarbij zij hunne vroegere gedaante behielden.
En eene stem zeide:
--Uilenspiegel, verbrand het hout.
En Uilenspiegel, zich naar de dwaallichtjes wendend, zeide:
--Gij, die het vuur zijt, verricht uwe taak.
En de dwaallichtjes omringden in groote menigte de Zeven, welke
verbrandden tot assche.
En het bloed vloeide bij stroomen.
En uit de assche kwamen zeven andere beelden te voorschijn; het
eerste zeide:
--Ik was Hooveerdigheid, nu heet ik edele Fierheid.
De anderen spraken ook, en Uilenspiegel en Nele zagen Zuinigheid komen
uit Gierigheid, Levendigheid uit Gramschap, Eetlust uit Gulzigheid,
Wedijver uit Nijd, Droomerij van dichters en denkers uit Traagheid. En
de Onkuischheid, op hare geit, veranderde in een schoone vrouw,
die Liefde hiet.
En de dwaallichtjes dansten een blijden dans rondom dezelve.
Uilenspiegel en Nele hoorden toen duizend heldere, grinnikende stemmen
van verborgen mannen en vrouwen, die zongen:
    Als over land en wateren
    Die Zeven, hervormd, zullen heerschen,
    Menschen, hoofden hoog!
    't Is het heil der wereld.
En Uilenspiegel zeide:
--Nele, die geesten spotten met ons.
Maar een machtige hand greep Nele bij den arm en wierp heur in het
luchtruim.
En de geesten zongen:
    Raakt het Noorden,
    Kussend het Westen,
    Rampspoed is uit.
    Vind de Zeven
    En den Gordel.
--Laas, zeide Uilenspiegel: Noord, West en Gordel.... Gij spreekt
wel raadselachtig, heeren Geesten.
En grinnikend zongen zij:
    't Noorden is Nederland,
    België 't Westen.
    Gordel is vriendschap,
    Gordel verbond.
--Dat is wijs gesproken, heeren Geesten, zeide Uilenspiegel.
En grinnikend zongen zij nog:
    De gordel, arme,
    Om Neerland en België,
    Zal vriendschap wezen,
    Vroom verbond.
    Met raad
    En daad,
    Met dood
    En bloed,
    Als 't moet,
    Was de Schelde daar niet,
    Arme, de Schelde.
--Laas, zei Uilenspiegel, dat is dus ons veelbewogen leven: tranen van
't menschdom en spotternij van 't lot.
Grinnikend hernamen de geesten:
    Verbond
    Met bloed
    En dood,
    Was de Schelde daar niet!
En een machtige hand greep Uilenspiegel en smeet hem in het luchtruim.
X.
Toen Nele ten gronde te recht kwam, zag zij niets anders meer dan
de zonne, die opstond te midden van de gulden dampen, de toppen
der grashalmen, die insgelijks als in goud gedoopt waren, en den
zonnestraal, die de veeren der slapende meeuwen kleurde. Maar de
meeuwen ontwaakten weldra.
Vervolgens bekeek Nele zich zelve, zij zag, dat ze naakt was, en ze
trok in der haast heure kleederen aan; vervolgens zag zij Uilenspiegel,
insgelijks naakt, en zij bedekte hem; zij dacht, dat hij sliep, en
zij schudde hem; maar hij verroerde zich niet meer dan een doode;
zij werd van schrik bevangen.
--Ha! zeide zij, heb ik mijnen vriend gedood met de tooverzalf? Ik
wil ook sterven! Ha! Thijl, word wakker! Hij is als marmer zoo koud!
Uilenspiegel werd niet wakker. Een dag en een nacht liepen voorbij,
en Nele, koortsachtig van smert, waakte bij heuren vriend Uilenspiegel.
In den morgen van den tweeden dag, hoorde Nele het geklingel eener bel,
en zij zag een boer komen met eene spade op den schouder; achter hem
gingen een burgemeester en twee schepenen met eene waskeers in de hand,
de parochiepaap van Stavenisse en een koster, die een zonnescherm
hield boven het hoofd van den paap.
Zij gingen, naar zij zeiden, het heilig oliesel toedienen aan den
dapperen Jacobsen, die vroeger Geus was uit schrik, maar die, nu het
gevaar voorbij was, vóór zijn dood terugkeerde tot den schoot der
Heilige Roomsche Kerke.
Weldra waren zij dicht bij Nele, die schreide, en zij zagen het lichaam
van Uilenspiegel uitgestrekt op het gras, met zijne kleederen aan.
Nele knielde neder.
--Meideken, zeide de burgemeester, wat doet gij bij dien doode?
Zij antwoordde, zonder de oogen te durven opslaan:
--Ik bid voor mijnen vriend, die hier viel, als door den bliksem
getroffen. Nu ben ik alleen: daarom wil ik insgelijks sterven!
De parochiepaap blies van genoegen en zei:
--God zij geloofd, de Geus Uilenspiegel is dood! Boer, haast u en delf
een graf; trek zijne kleederen uit, alvorens hem in de aarde te steken.
--Neen, zei Nele, rechtspringend, men zal ze hem aanlaten, hij zou
koude hebben in den killen grond.
--Delf een graf, zeide de parochiepaap tot den boer, die de spade
droeg.
--Ik wil wel, zeide Nele badend in tranen; daar zijn geene wormen in
het schelpzand, hij zal schoon en gaaf blijven, mijn geliefde.
En, als waanzinnig, bukte zij zich over het lichaam van Uilenspiegel
en kuste zij het met tranen en snikken.
De burgemeester, de schepenen en de boer hadden medelijden, maar de
pastoor zeide en herhaalde gedurig met blijdschap:
--De groote Geus is dood, God zij geloofd!
De boer dolf vervolgens een graf, legde Uilenspiegel er in en bedekte
hem met zand. En de parochiepaap las over het graf de gebeden der
dooden: allen knielden neder rondom het graf; doch plotseling zag men
onder het zand een groote beweging, en Uilenspiegel keek rond zich,
niesde en schudde het zand uit zijn haar, en greep den pastoor bij
de keel en zeide:
--Ketterbeul, gij begraaft mij levend in mijnen slaap. Waar is
Nele? Hebt gij ze ook in de aarde gedolven? Wie zijt gij?
De parochiepaap riep:
--De groote Geus verrijst op deze wereld! Heere God! wees mijne
ziele genadig!
En hij vluchtte weg als een hert voor de honden.
Nele kwam bij Uilenspiegel.
--Kus mij, liefste, zeide hij.
Toen keek hij opnieuw rondom zich; boer en koster waren op den loop
gegaan met den pastoor, en hadden, om rapper te loopen, spade,
waskeersen en zonnescherm ten gronde geworpen; burgemeester en
schepenen hielden van schrik hunne ooren vast en lagen te jammeren op
't gras.
Uilenspiegel ging tot hen en schudde hen.
--Begraaft men, zeide hij, Uilenspiegel, den geest, Nele, het hert
van Vlaanderen? Neen! Vlaanderen kan ook slapen, maar sterven,
nooit! Kom, Nele.
En hij toog henen met heur en zong zijn zesde liedeken, maar niemand
weet waar hij zijn laatste zingen zal....
                                 EINDE.
AANTEEKENINGEN
[1] Deze Voorrede werd, met een bepaald aantal platen, gevoegd in de
eerste Fransche uitgave. (Lacroix-Verboeckhoven & Co.)
[2] Die bewering is nauwkeurig. Aan een Vlaamsch boekje van den
uitgever Van Paemel, getiteld: Het aerdig leven van Thyl Uylenspiegel,
ontleende de dichter een aantal hoofdstukken van het Eerste Boek van
zijn werk.
[3] Over afleiding en beteekenis van het woord "Uilenspiegel"
verschillen wij--en zeker de meeste Vlamingen met ons--teenemaal met
Ch. de Coster. Omstandige, langdradige dissertatiën daaromtrent zullen
wel overbodig zijn, en hooren ook in dit boek niet te huis. Zoo wij
deze Voorrede in de Vlaamsche uitgave brachten, was het dus enkel
met het inzicht het werk van Charles De Coster te eerbiedigen, en
het, in zijn geheel, den Vlaamschen lezer aan te bieden. (Noot van
